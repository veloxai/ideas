### B.3 Unit Economics

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**:

```
Year 1:  $75 per user
Year 2:  $50 per user (improving efficiency)
Year 3:  $30 per user (organic growth)
Year 4:  $25 per user
Year 5:  $20 per user (strong network effects)
```

**Lifetime Value (LTV)**:

```
Premium User:
  - Monthly: $24.99
  - Annual retention: 70%
  - Avg lifetime: 3.3 years
  - LTV: $24.99 × 12 × 3.3 = $989

Institutional User (per seat):
  - Monthly: $50
  - Annual retention: 85%
  - Avg lifetime: 5 years
  - LTV: $50 × 12 × 5 = $3,000
```

**LTV:CAC Ratio**:

```
Year 1:  $989 / $75 = 13.2:1  ✅ Excellent
Year 3:  $989 / $30 = 33:1    ✅ Outstanding
Year 5:  $989 / $20 = 49:1    ✅ Best-in-class
```

**Payback Period**:

```
Premium: 3 months (3 × $24.99 = $75 CAC recovered)
Institutional: 2 months (2 × $50 = $100 CAC recovered)
```

### B.4 Funding Requirements

**Seed Round** (Current): **$3,000,000**

- Use: 18-month runway to Series A
- Valuation: $12M pre-money
- Investor return target: 10x (exit at $150M+)

**Series A** (Month 15): **$10,000,000**

- Use: Scale to 100K users, profitability
- Valuation: $40M pre-money
- Metrics: $3M ARR, 100K users, 40% retention

**Series B** (Year 3): **$30,000,000** (optional)

- Use: International expansion, M&A
- Valuation: $150M pre-money
- Metrics: $10M ARR, profitable, 250K users

**Exit Scenarios**:

```
Year 5:   IPO at $500M - 1B valuation
          or
          Strategic acquisition $300-800M
          (Doximity, Microsoft, EPIC, etc.)

Year 10:  IPO at $2-5B valuation
          (if building category-defining platform)
```

### B.5 Break-Even Analysis

**Fixed Costs** (Monthly):

```
Engineering:              $75,000  (5-7 engineers)
Product/Design:           $20,000  (2 people)
Operations:               $15,000  (2-3 people)
Infrastructure:           $5,000   (AWS, tools)
Marketing:                $10,000  (content, ads)
Legal/Compliance:         $5,000   (attorney retainer)
Total Fixed:              $130,000/month
```

**Variable Costs** (per user):

```
Infrastructure:           $0.50/user/month
Support:                  $0.25/user/month
Moderation:               $0.15/user/month
Total Variable:           $0.90/user/month
```

**Break-Even Calculation**:

```
Premium Revenue:          $24.99/month
Variable Cost:            $0.90/month
Contribution Margin:      $24.09/month

Break-Even Users:         $130,000 / $24.09 = 5,397 premium users
At 5% conversion:         107,940 total users

Expected: Break-even at ~100K users (Month 18-24)
```
