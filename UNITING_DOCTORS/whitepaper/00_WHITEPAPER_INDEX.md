## 🎯 Executive Overview

**Uniting Doctors** is a social platform for medical professionals that breaks down information silos, accelerates knowledge sharing, and improves patient outcomes through global collaboration. Born from the mission to raise awareness about Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD)—a rare disease that affects 100,000+ Americans yet remains 95% undiagnosed—we're building the world's most trusted medical community platform.

**The Opportunity**:

- 📊 **$1.3B Market Opportunity** (60M medical professionals globally)
- 💰 **$25M Revenue by Year 5** with clear path to profitability
- 🌍 **500,000 users by Year 5** across 150+ countries
- ❤️ **50,000+ lives improved** through earlier rare disease diagnosis

**Investment Ask**: **$3M Seed Round** for 18-month runway to Series A

---

### [Chapter 2: Problem Statement](./02_PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md) (~3,800 words)

**Information Silos in Modern Medicine**

- Medical knowledge trapped in journals, institutions, geographic regions
- 2.5M+ papers published annually—impossible to keep current
- Paywall barriers to critical research
- No trusted platform for peer-to-peer medical discussion

**The AATD Story: A Personal Mission**

- Mark Egly's son Max: years of undiagnosed AATD
- 100,000+ Americans affected, only 5% diagnosed
- Simple blood test exists but rarely ordered
- Preventable lung damage from delayed diagnosis

**Five Barriers to Knowledge Sharing**

1. Fear of judgment (medical errors not openly discussed)
2. Geographic silos (rural vs. urban knowledge gap)
3. Time constraints (no time to read 2.5M papers/year)
4. Information overload (no curation or synthesis)
5. Lack of trusted peers (no professional community platform)

**The Cost of Delayed Information**

- Patient harm from outdated practices
- Wasted healthcare spending ($750B annually on unnecessary care)
- Physician burnout from isolation
- Slower medical progress

**COVID-19: A Wake-Up Call**

- Rapid information sharing saved lives
- Medical professionals turned to informal WhatsApp groups
- Demonstrated urgent need for professional platform

- **Market/Competition** (6 risks): Incumbents, low adoption, market timing
- **Financial** (5 risks): Insufficient funding, revenue failure, economic downturn
- **Operational** (8 risks): Moderation, verification fraud, key person risk
- **Reputational** (4 risks): Negative press, controversial content

**Contingency Budget**: $345K (15% of $2.28M budget)

### [Chapter 10: Impact & Vision](./10_IMPACT_VISION.md) (~7,500 words)

**Social Impact Thesis**

**The Problem**: Medical knowledge silos cost lives

- 17-year lag from research discovery to clinical practice
- 95% of AATD cases undiagnosed (100K+ Americans affected)
- $350B annual cost of medical errors in US

**The Mark Egly Story** (Why We Exist)

Mark Egly's son **Max** suffered for years with undiagnosed AATD. Doctors never suspected it—95% of AATD cases remain undiagnosed because physicians simply don't think to test. By the time Max was diagnosed, significant lung damage had occurred.

Mark founded the **Mark Egly Foundation** with a mission: **Ensure AATD is never under-diagnosed again.**

Uniting Doctors is **Max's legacy**: a platform where medical professionals discuss rare diseases openly, diagnostic insights spread in hours (not years), and no patient suffers from preventable late diagnosis.

**Organizational Values**

1. **Evidence Over Opinion**: Citations expected, peer-reviewed
2. **Patient First, Always**: Privacy sacred, quality over quantity
3. **Global Equity**: Knowledge is a human right, 50% developing world users by Year 5
4. **Professional Respect**: Anonymity when needed, no hierarchy
5. **Radical Transparency**: Open policies, public roadmap, annual impact reports
6. **Continuous Learning**: Platform for growth, mistakes are learning opportunities
