## Core Principles

### 1. Evidence-Based Medicine

**Standard**: All clinical recommendations must be supported by peer-reviewed evidence or established clinical guidelines.

**Requirements**:

- Citations to primary sources (peer-reviewed journals, clinical trials)
- Reference to clinical practice guidelines (AHA, ACC, ESC, NICE, etc.)
- Clear distinction between evidence-based practice and expert opinion
- Disclosure of evidence quality (high, moderate, low)

### 2. Patient Safety First

**Standard**: Content must not pose risk to patient safety.

**Prohibited Content**:

- Dangerous medical advice without proper context
- Encouragement to discontinue medications without physician consultation
- Unproven treatments presented as standard care
- Diagnostic advice that could delay proper medical evaluation

### 3. Transparency & Disclosure

**Requirements**:

- Conflicts of interest disclosed (pharmaceutical ties, financial relationships)
- Uncertainty acknowledged when evidence is limited
- Off-label uses clearly labeled
- Limitations of observational data noted

### 4. Professional Standards

**Standard**: Content must align with professional medical ethics and standards of care.

**Guidelines**:

- Respect patient autonomy and informed consent
- Maintain professional tone and terminology
- Avoid sensationalism or fear-mongering
- Respect cultural and ethical diversity in medicine

## Medical Accuracy Verification

### AI-Powered Fact-Checking

**Automated Verification**:

```python
async def verify_medical_claim(claim_text):
    """
    Use GPT-4 + PubMed to verify medical claims
    """
    # Step 1: Extract medical assertions
    assertions = extract_claims(claim_text)

    verification_results = []
    for assertion in assertions:
        # Step 2: Search PubMed for supporting evidence
        evidence = await search_pubmed(assertion)

        # Step 3: GPT-4 fact-check
        prompt = f"""
        Medical Claim: "{assertion}"

        PubMed Evidence:
        {evidence}

        Assess accuracy:
        1. Accurate (well-supported by evidence)
        2. Partially accurate (evidence mixed)
        3. Inaccurate (contradicted by evidence)
        4. Unverifiable (insufficient evidence)

        Provide assessment and brief explanation.
        """

        result = await gpt4_evaluate(prompt)
        verification_results.append({
            'claim': assertion,
            'assessment': result.accuracy,
            'explanation': result.explanation,
            'supporting_evidence': evidence[:3]  # Top 3 sources
        })

    return verification_results
```

**Verification Results Display**:

```
✅ Verified: "Beta-blockers reduce mortality in HFrEF"
   Evidence: 12 RCTs, 3 systematic reviews support this claim

⚠️ Partially Verified: "Most patients tolerate beta-blockers well"
   Evidence: Mixed data on tolerability (60-80% depending on population)

❌ Inaccurate: "Beta-blockers cure heart failure"
   Evidence: Beta-blockers improve outcomes but do not cure HF

❓ Unverifiable: "Patients feel better within 24 hours"
   Evidence: Insufficient data on symptom onset timing
```
