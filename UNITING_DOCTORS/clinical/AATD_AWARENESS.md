# UNITING DOCTORS - AATD AWARENESS CAMPAIGN

**Last Updated**: November 8, 2025

---

## 🎯 Mission: Raising AATD Awareness

Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) is a genetic condition affecting an estimated 100,000+ Americans, yet it remains severely under-diagnosed. Our platform's origin story centers on AATD awareness, making this a core pillar of Uniting Doctors.

## 📊 AATD Background

### What is AATD?

**Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency** is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the lungs and liver:
- **Genetic**: Inherited from both parents (autosomal recessive)
- **Protein Deficiency**: Low levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein
- **Organ Damage**: AAT protects lungs from neutrophil elastase damage
- **Symptoms**: COPD-like symptoms, often misdiagnosed as asthma or COPD

### The Under-Diagnosis Problem

**Current State**:
- Estimated 100,000-200,000 affected individuals in the US
- Only ~10,000 diagnosed (95% undiagnosed)
- Average 5-7 years from symptom onset to diagnosis
- Often misdiagnosed as asthma, COPD, or chronic bronchitis

**Why Under-Diagnosed**:
- ❌ Low awareness among physicians (not taught in medical school)
- ❌ Symptoms overlap with common conditions
- ❌ Simple test exists but rarely ordered
- ❌ No standardized screening protocols

## 🎯 Campaign Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Educate 100,000+ medical professionals** about AATD in Year 1
2. **Increase AATD testing rates** by 25% in target specialties
3. **Reduce time to diagnosis** from 5-7 years to <2 years
4. **Build AATD community** of specialists, patients, and advocates

### Secondary Goals
1. Advocate for AATD screening in at-risk populations
2. Connect diagnosed patients with specialists
3. Share latest AATD research and treatment options
4. Support AATD families and caregivers
