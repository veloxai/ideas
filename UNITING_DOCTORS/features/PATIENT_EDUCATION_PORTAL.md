SECTION 1: WHAT IS AATD?

Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) is a
genetic condition where your body doesn't make
enough of a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin
(AAT). This protein protects your lungs from
damage.

[Easy to understand diagram showing lungs and
protein protection]

Think of AAT as a shield that protects your
lungs. When you don't have enough shield, your
lungs can become damaged over time, leading to
breathing problems.

KEY POINTS:
✓ Genetic (inherited from parents)
✓ Affects lungs primarily
✓ Can also affect liver
✓ Treatable but not curable
✓ Early diagnosis improves outcomes

### 8. Health Literacy Tools

**Purpose**: Improve understanding of medical information

**Tools**:

- **Medical Jargon Translator**: Paste medical text, get plain language
- **Lab Result Explainer**: Upload results, understand what they mean
- **Reading Level Adjuster**: Adjust complexity of medical articles
- **Visual Learning Library**: Diagrams, animations, infographics
- **Audio Pronunciations**: How to say medical terms

**Jargon Translator Example**:

```
🔤 MEDICAL JARGON TRANSLATOR
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Paste text from medical report, article, or
discharge instructions to get plain language explanation.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ORIGINAL TEXT:
"Patient presents with exertional dyspnea and
decreased FEV1 consistent with obstructive
pulmonary disease. Recommend spirometry with
bronchodilator and serum AAT quantification."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAIN LANGUAGE:
"Patient has shortness of breath when active
and reduced lung function that suggests blocked
airways. Recommend breathing tests before and
after using inhaler medication, plus a blood test
to check alpha-1 antitrypsin levels."

KEY TERMS EXPLAINED:
• Exertional dyspnea = Shortness of breath with activity
• FEV1 = Forced expiratory volume - how much air
  you can blow out in 1 second
• Obstructive pulmonary disease = Blocked airways
• Spirometry = Breathing test
• Bronchodilator = Inhaler that opens airways
• AAT quantification = Blood test measuring AAT levels
