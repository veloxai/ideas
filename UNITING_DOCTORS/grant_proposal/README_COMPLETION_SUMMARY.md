## 💡 Key Messages for Funders

**For Health Equity Funders**:

> "Medical knowledge is currently a privilege of wealthy, urban, well-connected healthcare professionals. We're making it a universal right. 35% of our users will come from rural or underserved areas, and 25% from developing countries—all with free access to premium features. Your investment ensures no healthcare professional is left behind."

**For Rare Disease Funders**:

> "95% of AATD cases remain undiagnosed—not because we lack a test, but because physicians don't think to order it. We'll educate 100,000+ professionals about AATD in 24 months, leading to 5,000+ earlier diagnoses and preventing irreversible organ damage. This model scales to 100+ rare diseases."

**For Healthcare Quality Funders**:

> "Medical errors cost $350 billion annually in the US alone. Our platform enables physicians to ask for help anonymously, reducing diagnostic errors and improving patient safety. We estimate 10,000+ errors prevented in Year 2, saving $500 million in healthcare costs—a 125:1 social ROI."

**For Global Health Funders**:

> "A physician in rural Kenya has the same right to current medical knowledge as a professor at Harvard. We're providing free platform access to 10,000+ healthcare workers in low-resource settings, connecting them with global expertise. This is knowledge equity at scale."

**For Research Funders**:

> "It takes 17 years for research findings to reach clinical practice. We're building the highway that accelerates knowledge translation. Our platform integrates with PubMed, hosts expert discussions, and tracks real-world implementation. We'll publish 10+ peer-reviewed papers documenting our impact."
