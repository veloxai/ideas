  - Beta program with engaged early adopters (500 users)
  - Clear go/no-go decision points (Month 6, Month 12 reviews)
  - Multiple user acquisition channels (partnerships, content, paid)
  - Strong mission alignment (AATD awareness = authentic purpose)
  - Regular user research and rapid iteration
  - Pivot options documented (narrower specialty focus if needed)

**3. Content Moderation Challenges**
