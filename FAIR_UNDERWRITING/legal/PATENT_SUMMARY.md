## Patent Overview

The patent describes a revolutionary system that allows insurance companies to use Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) status information in underwriting while protecting the genetic privacy of applicants and insureds.

### Key Innovation

The patent establishes a legal framework where:

1. **Insurance companies CAN**:
   - Offer AAT testing to applicants/insureds
   - Provide educational information about AATD
   - Use AAT information in underwriting (with consent)
   - Order testing for applicants during underwriting

2. **Insurance companies CANNOT**:
   - Require genetic SERPINA1 data disclosure post-policy issuance (Claim 34)
   - Discriminate based on genetic information without consent
   - Access private genetic test results without authorization

3. **Insureds CAN**:
   - Get tested privately without disclosing results to insurers
   - Receive free or subsidized testing through insurance partners
   - Maintain complete privacy over genetic information
   - Benefit from early detection and treatment

## Critical Patent Claims

### Claim 1: Pre-Underwriting AAT Testing

Insurance underwriting using:

- Personal information
- Medical information
- **AAT status information**
- Determination of policy eligibility based on all three

### Claim 12: Post-Underwriting Testing

- Determine eligibility based on personal + medical info ONLY
- **AFTER** policy eligibility is determined, obtain AAT test results
- **Key difference**: Genetic data obtained AFTER underwriting decision

### Claim 34: Privacy Protection (CRITICAL)

> "The insured is not required to provide the results of the test to the insurance provider."

**This is the cornerstone of Fair Underwriting's value proposition.**

## How the Patent Enables Our Business Model

### Method 200 (Figure 2): Traditional Approach

1. Obtain personal information
2. Obtain medical information
3. **Obtain AAT status** (genetic or circulating levels)
4. Determine eligibility using all data
5. (Optional) Provide additional AATD education

**Use Case**: Applicant voluntarily shares AAT data for potentially better rates

### Method 400 (Figure 3): Privacy-First Approach

1. Obtain personal information
2. Obtain medical information
3. Determine eligibility (NO genetic data used)
4. **AFTER policy issued**: Order AAT testing for insured
5. Results kept private from insurance company

**Use Case**: Our primary B2B2C model - insurer sponsors testing, customer keeps results private

### Method 600 (Figure 4): Comprehensive Testing

1. Obtain personal information
2. Obtain medical information
3. **Determine AAT deficiency status** (biological sample analysis)
4. Determine eligibility using all information

**Use Case**: Full genetic + circulating AAT level analysis

### Method 700 (Figure 5): Post-Policy Privacy Testing

1. Obtain personal information
2. Obtain medical information
3. Determine eligibility (NO AAT data)
4. **AFTER eligibility determined**: Test for AAT deficiency
5. Results remain private

**Use Case**: Our primary implementation - maximum privacy protection

## Testing Device (Claim 160)

The patent describes an at-home testing device for AATD that:

- Collects biological samples (blood, saliva)
- Determines genotype and/or phenotype for AATD
- Can test for SERPINA1 gene mutations
- Can measure circulating AAT levels
- Provides educational information about AATD
- Allows private testing without third-party disclosure
- Outputs analysis results directly to user

**This is exactly what we're building for the Fair Underwriting platform.**

---

## Two Types of AAT Information

### 1. Genetic Information (SERPINA1 Gene)

- **What it tests**: Specific mutations in SERPINA1 gene
- **Common variants**: PiZ, PiS, and rare mutations
- **Method**: DNA extraction from saliva or blood
- **Result**: Genotype indicating AATD predisposition
- **Privacy level**: HIGHEST (genetic data)

### 2. Circulating AAT Levels (Phenotype)

- **What it tests**: Current AAT protein levels in blood
- **Normal range**: 100-200 mg/dL
- **Method**: Blood serum test or dried blood spot
- **Result**: Actual AAT concentration
- **Clinical value**:
  - Low levels indicate AATD or liver issues
  - High levels (4x normal) indicate acute inflammation/illness
  - Can be monitored over time

**Our platform monitors BOTH for comprehensive health insights.**
