# Fair Underwriting - Competitive Analysis

**Last Updated**: November 7, 2025
**Analysis Type**: Market Positioning & Competitive Intelligence
**Status**: Active Market Research

---

## Executive Summary

Fair Underwriting operates in a **unique market position** at the intersection of genetic testing, insurance wellness programs, and privacy protection. While there are competitors in adjacent spaces, **no direct competitors exist** with our specific combination of:

1. **Patent-protected privacy framework** (post-policy genetic testing)
2. **B2B2C insurance partnership model** (insurer-sponsored, customer-private)
3. **Focus on SERPINA1/AATD** with MZ carrier detection
4. **Privacy-first architecture** preventing actuarial discrimination

**Key Finding**: Our primary competition is **customer inertia and genetic privacy fears**, not other companies.

- **Underserved market** (>95% undiagnosed)

### 3. **B2B2C Model** 💼

- **Insurance partnerships** (not DTC)
- **Free to customer** (insurer-paid)
- **Privacy guarantee** (customer owns data, insurer can't access)
- **Win-win-win** (customer, insurer, Fair Underwriting)

### 4. **Clinical Focus** 🔬

---

## Competitive Threats & Mitigation

### Threat 1: DTC Genetic Companies Add AATD

**Risk**: 23andMe, Color, or others add SERPINA1 testing
**Likelihood**: Medium (low priority for them)
**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation**:

- ✅ Our B2B2C model and insurance privacy protection are differentiated
- ✅ MZ-specific expertise and counseling
- ✅ Patent protection prevents insurance partnership model
- ✅ First-mover advantage with insurance partners

### Threat 2: AlphaNet Expands to MZ/Prevention

**Risk**: AlphaNet shifts focus from ZZ to MZ carriers
**Likelihood**: Low (Grifols conflict of interest - MZ doesn't need augmentation therapy)
**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation**:

- ✅ We have insurance partnership model (they don't)
- ✅ Privacy protection (they don't offer)
- ✅ Technology platform (they're service organization)
- ✅ No treatment conflict of interest

### Threat 3: Insurance Companies Build In-House

**Risk**: Large insurers develop own AATD testing programs
**Likelihood**: Low (not core competency)
**Impact**: High (loss of potential partner)

**Mitigation**:

- ✅ Patent protection (they need to license)
- ✅ Technical complexity and compliance burden
- ✅ Faster to partner than build
- ✅ Our platform serves multiple insurers (economies of scale)

### Threat 4: Quest/LabCorp Launch Consumer Model

**Risk**: Clinical labs go direct-to-consumer or partner with insurers
**Likelihood**: Low (not their business model)
**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation**:

- ✅ We can partner with them as lab provider
- ✅ Our value is software/platform, not lab testing
- ✅ Privacy framework and insurance model are differentiated

### Threat 5: Regulatory Changes (FDA)

**Risk**: FDA reclassifies SERPINA1 as requiring PMA (not LDT)
**Likelihood**: Low-Medium (FDA focus on high-risk tests)
**Impact**: High (delays, costs)

**Mitigation**:

- ✅ Work with FDA-approved lab partners
- ✅ AATD testing is established (low controversy)
- ✅ Clinical utility well-documented
- ✅ Budget for regulatory pathways in financial model

## Competitive Response Playbook

### When Prospect Says: "We already work with [Wellness Vendor]"

**Response**:

- "Great! Fair Underwriting complements activity-tracking programs by adding genetic health insights"
- "We can integrate with [Virgin Pulse, etc.] to provide genetic testing as a wellness benefit"
- "Our AATD testing identifies the 2-3% with MZ variants who benefit most from lifestyle interventions like smoking cessation"

### When Prospect Says: "Can't we just use 23andMe?"

**Response**:

- "23andMe doesn't test for SERPINA1/AATD, which affects 1 in 25-40 people"
- "23andMe doesn't have privacy protections preventing actuarial use of genetic data"
- "Our patent framework legally protects your customers from discrimination, which 23andMe cannot provide"
- "We include genetic counseling for actionable results; 23andMe does not"

### When Prospect Says: "Our customers can get tested through Quest/LabCorp"

**Response**:

- "That requires a doctor's order, usually only after symptoms appear"
- "We enable preventive testing before irreversible damage occurs"
- "Quest/LabCorp results go to physicians and potentially to insurance records; ours are privacy-protected"
- "We partner with Quest/LabCorp as lab providers—we add the insurance wellness model and privacy framework on top"

### When Prospect Says: "We're concerned about genetic discrimination"

**Response**:

- "That's exactly why we exist! Our patent specifically addresses this concern"
- "Claim 34 legally states insureds are NOT required to share genetic results with insurers"
- "We built a 5-level data segregation architecture ensuring you never see individual genetic data"
- "You get population-level health insights; customers get personal health insights; everyone wins"
