### Slide 2: The Problem

**Visual**: Split-screen showing anxious customer + stack of bills

**Headline**: **Genetic Testing is Broken**

**3 Key Problems** (bullet points with icons):

1. **Fear of Discrimination** 🔒
   - 72% of Americans worried genetic test results will be used against them by insurers
   - GINA protections exist but public doesn't trust them
   - Result: Only 4% of eligible people get genetic testing

2. **Diagnostic Gaps Kill** 💔
   - Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD): 100,000+ Americans affected, 90% undiagnosed
   - MZ carriers (1 in 25): 2-4x COPD risk, but rarely tested until symptomatic
   - Late diagnosis = irreversible lung/liver damage

3. **Insurers Miss Prevention Opportunity** 💰
   - COPD costs insurers $5,000-15,000/year per patient
   - Early detection + smoking cessation = 58% risk reduction
   - Insurers don't screen because they can't access results without violating privacy → **catch-22**

**Speaker Notes**:

- "Genetic testing should be the ultimate preventive care tool—catch disease risk before symptoms, intervene early, save lives and money. But it's not working."
- "The root cause? Privacy fears. People are terrified their insurer will see their results and discriminate against them."
- "This fear is rational—GINA doesn't protect life or disability insurance. So people skip testing, diseases go undetected, and preventable deaths happen."
- "Meanwhile, insurers WANT to prevent disease—they'd love to identify MZ carriers and help them quit smoking—but they can't screen without violating privacy. It's a broken system."

### Slide 3: The Solution

**Visual**: Fair Underwriting platform screenshot (portal showing "Your Results are Private" badge)

**Headline**: **Privacy-Protected Genetic Wellness**

**How It Works** (3-step diagram with icons):

1. **Insurer Partners with Fair Underwriting** 🤝
   - Life/health insurers offer genetic testing to policyholders as wellness benefit
   - Branded co-branded portal (e.g., "Northwestern Mutual + Fair Underwriting")

2. **Customer Enrolls (Privacy Guaranteed)** ✅
   - At-home saliva kit (mail to Quest/LabCorp)
   - Results go ONLY to customer (patent-protected privacy framework—US 20220165374)
   - Insurer gets aggregate data only (e.g., "15% enrollment, 40 MZ carriers detected") → **NO individual results**

3. **Fair Underwriting Empowers Action** 💪
   - Genetic counseling session (licensed CGC)
   - MZ carriers get personalized action plan (smoking cessation, annual PFTs, family screening)
   - Lifestyle change support (health coaching, educational resources)

**Unique Value Proposition** (callout box):

> "The ONLY genetic testing platform where insurers can fund screening WITHOUT accessing individual customer results. Privacy + prevention, finally aligned."

**Speaker Notes**:

- "Fair Underwriting solves the catch-22. Insurers can offer genetic testing as a wellness benefit—builds goodwill, attracts health-conscious customers—while Fair Underwriting owns the customer relationship and results."
- "Our patent-protected framework ensures insurers CANNOT access individual results. Legally and technically impossible."
- "Customers get peace of mind—test without fear—and insurers get aggregate insights to prove ROI (e.g., 'Our members who tested and found MZ are 3x more likely to quit smoking')."
- "It's a win-win: customers get empowerment, insurers get prevention, Fair Underwriting gets a massive market."

### Slide 4: Market Opportunity

**Visual**: TAM/SAM/SOM concentric circles + bar chart showing growth

**Headline**: **$8B+ Market, Growing 15% Annually**

**Market Sizing**:

**Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: $8.2 Billion

- 250 million U.S. adults with private insurance (life, health, disability)
- Assume 25% eligible for genetic wellness programs (age 30-65, no prior genetic testing)
- 62.5 million eligible customers × $130 blended price = $8.2B TAM

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)**: $2.1 Billion

- Target mid-size to large insurers (100K-5M members)
- ~200 insurers in this segment, ~50M total members
- 40% penetration (wellness-forward insurers) = 20M eligible members
- 20M × $105 ARPU (assuming 5% enrollment, $250/test + $30/year monitoring) = $2.1B SAM

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM, Year 5)**: $75-100 Million

- 15-25 partner insurers, 5-10M total covered lives
- 5-10% enrollment rate = 250K-500K customers tested
- $250/test + 3 years × $30/year monitoring = $340 LTV per customer
- Revenue: $50M-100M (assumes 50% gross margin on testing, 70% on monitoring)

**Growth Drivers** (3 icons with short descriptions):

1. **Genetic Testing Adoption** 📈: 20% CAGR (Illumina, 23andMe, FDA approvals normalizing testing)
2. **Preventive Care Trend** 🩺: Insurers shifting from reactive (treat disease) to proactive (prevent disease)
3. **Privacy Regulation** 🔐: CCPA, GDPR, genetic privacy laws → demand for privacy-first solutions

**Speaker Notes**:

- "$8 billion TAM, growing at 15% annually. This is genetic testing meets preventive care meets digital health—three massive trends converging."
- "Our SAM is $2 billion—focused on mid-size to large insurers with wellness programs. Think Northwestern Mutual, Cambia, regional Blues plans."
- "Year 5, we capture $75-100M of that—15-25 partner insurers, 250K-500K customers tested. That's 4-5% market share of our SAM—highly achievable with first-mover advantage and patent protection."
- "And this is just AATD. Roadmap includes expansion to other genetic conditions (familial hypercholesterolemia, hereditary cancers) → 5-10x TAM."

### Slide 6: Business Model

**Visual**: Revenue stream waterfall chart

**Headline**: **Proven B2B2C Model with Multiple Revenue Streams**

**Revenue Streams**:

1. **Per-Test Fee** (Primary, 70% of Year 1-3 revenue)
   - Insurer pays $250-500 per customer tested
   - Blended average: $350 per test
   - Includes: genetic test + genetic counseling + 1-year portal access

2. **Annual Subscription** (Secondary, growing to 40% of Year 4-5 revenue)
   - $30-75/year per customer for ongoing monitoring
   - Includes: annual PFT reminders, updated research, family screening tools, lifestyle coaching
   - Attach rate: 20-30% of tested customers (Year 1) → 40-50% (Year 5)

3. **Platform Licensing** (Future, Year 3+)
   - License Fair Underwriting platform to labs, pharma companies, employers
   - $100K-500K/year per licensee
   - White-label option (e.g., "Quest Genetic Wellness powered by Fair Underwriting")

4. **Data Licensing** (Future, Year 4+)
   - Aggregate, de-identified data for research (pharma, biotech, academia)
   - $50K-200K per dataset
   - Customer consent required, privacy-preserving (no re-identification possible)

**Unit Economics** (table):

| **Metric**               | **Year 1** | **Year 3** | **Year 5** |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **Revenue per customer** | $250       | $320       | $400       |
| **COGS**                 | $150       | $120       | $100       |
| **Gross Margin**         | $100 (40%) | $200 (63%) | $300 (75%) |
| **CAC**                  | $600       | $400       | $300       |
| **LTV**                  | $300       | $800       | $1,500     |
| **LTV:CAC**              | 0.5x       | 2.0x       | 5.0x       |
| **Payback Period**       | 36 mo      | 18 mo      | 9 mo       |

**Speaker Notes**:

- "B2B2C model—we partner with insurers (B2B) to reach their policyholders (C). Insurers pay, customers benefit, Fair Underwriting earns recurring revenue."
- "Per-test fee is the wedge—gets us in the door. But subscriptions are the gold—sticky, high-margin, growing."
- "Year 1, unit economics are underwater—LTV $300, CAC $600. But by Year 3, we're at 2x LTV:CAC (break-even), and Year 5, we're at 5x (highly profitable)."
- "The magic is in the subscription attach rate. Once customers see value (genetic counseling, lifestyle support), 40-50% renew annually. That's $30-75/year with near-zero COGS—pure margin."
- "Long-term, we license the platform (Quest, pharma) and aggregate data (research). These are 80%+ margin revenue streams."

- FY2025 (projected): $360K total revenue
- FY2026 (projected): $1.2M revenue (3x growth—4 new pilots, subscription ramp)

**Case Study Highlight** (customer testimonial box):

> "I never would have known I was MZ without Fair Underwriting. I quit smoking immediately, got a baseline PFT, and convinced my brother to get tested (he's MZ too!). This literally saved my life."
> — Sarah M., age 42, MZ carrier, Northwestern Mutual policyholder

**Speaker Notes**:

- "We're not a PowerPoint—we have real traction. 1,200 customers enrolled, 45 MZ carriers detected, 62 NPS. This is working."
- "8% enrollment rate beats our 5% target. Why? Privacy messaging resonates. Customers trust us because their insurer doesn't see their results."
- "Genetic counseling is the hero. 68 NPS for counseling sessions—customers rave about it. And 87% of MZ carriers take action. That's behavior change at scale."
- "ROI is real. 34% smoking cessation among MZ carriers vs. 6% baseline. That's a 5.7x improvement. Insurers save $1,200-2,500 per MZ carrier over 5 years by preventing COPD."
- "Partners love us—NPS 55. They're already asking to expand beyond pilot. That's the signal: we've found product-market fit."

### Slide 9: Competitive Landscape

**Visual**: 2×2 matrix (X-axis: Privacy Protection, Y-axis: Insurance Integration)

**Headline**: **Unique Position: Privacy + Insurance, No Direct Competitors**

**Competitive Matrix**:

**Quadrant 1 (High Privacy, Low Insurance Integration)**:

- **23andMe, AncestryDNA**: DTC genetic testing, privacy-focused, but no insurance partnerships
- **Invitae, Color**: Clinical genetic testing, HIPAA-compliant, but no privacy framework for insurers
- **Weakness**: Customers pay out-of-pocket ($99-299), no insurance funding

**Quadrant 2 (High Privacy, High Insurance Integration)**:

- **Fair Underwriting** (us!) 🎯
- Patent-protected privacy framework + insurance partnerships
- ONLY player in this quadrant

**Quadrant 3 (Low Privacy, High Insurance Integration)**:

- **Employer wellness programs** (Virgin Pulse, Livongo): Integrated with benefits, but employers see data
- **Insurer wellness programs** (UnitedHealthcare HouseCalls): Insurer-run, no privacy
- **Weakness**: Customers fear discrimination, low enrollment (2-5% for genetic screening)

**Quadrant 4 (Low Privacy, Low Insurance Integration)**:

- **Hospital genetic testing**: Doctor-ordered, medical records accessible
- **Research studies**: Institutional, consent-heavy, slow
- **Weakness**: Limited scale, not preventive/wellness-focused

**Competitive Advantages** (Fair Underwriting):

1. **Patent Moat** 🏰
   - US 20220165374 protects privacy framework (20-year exclusivity)
   - Competitors must license or risk infringement lawsuit

2. **First-Mover Advantage** ⚡
   - Only company with pilot partnerships + case studies + revenue
   - Incumbency (switching costs for partners)

3. **Specialization** 🔬
   - Deep expertise in AATD, MZ carriers (vs. broad genetic panels)
   - Clinical workflows, counseling scripts, educational content optimized for AATD

4. **Customer Experience** ❤️
   - 62 NPS (vs. 23andMe ~40, employer wellness ~20)
   - Genetic counseling (live human support vs. automated reports)

**Potential Future Competitors** (watch list):

- **Quest/LabCorp**: Could launch competing platform, but would need to license our patent or build alternative privacy framework
- **Insurance Incumbents**: Could build in-house, but unlikely (not core competency, IP barriers)
- **Pharma/Biotech**: Could offer free testing (promotional), but different business model (drug sales, not wellness)

**Speaker Notes**:

- "Fair Underwriting occupies a unique space: privacy + insurance. No one else has both."
- "23andMe has privacy but no insurance partnerships—customers pay $99-199 out-of-pocket. Employer wellness has insurance integration but no privacy—customers fear discrimination."
- "We have both. Patent-protected privacy + insurance funding. That's the magic."
- "Our patent is the moat. Competitors can't replicate without licensing our IP. Quest or LabCorp could try, but they'd need to negotiate with us first."
- "First-mover advantage is real. We have 2 pilot partners, 1,200 customers, 45 MZ carriers detected. Competitors are starting from zero."

  - Use: Scale to 5-7 pilots → 20 pilots, hire sales/counseling teams (7 → 30 employees), expand to Tier 2 states, platform features
  - Runway: 24-30 months (to breakeven or Series B)

- **Series B (Future)**: $20-30M projected (Q3 2027)
  - Use: National expansion (50+ partners), product expansion (FH, hereditary cancers), enterprise sales team, Series C/IPO prep
  - Milestone: $15M+ ARR, positive unit economics, clear path to $100M ARR

**Speaker Notes**:

- "Capital-efficient model. We're raising $10-15M Series A to scale from 2 pilots to 20 pilots, 1,500 customers to 50,000 customers."
- "Burn is manageable—$2M/year in Year 1, $3.5M/year in Year 3. This isn't a burn-$50M-to-find-product-market-fit story. We've found it. Now we scale."
- "Profitability in Year 5. $31.5M revenue, $3.5M net income, 11% net margin. That's a VC-backable outcome."
- "Gross margin expansion is the key—35% Year 1 (testing-heavy, high COGS) to 70% Year 5 (subscription mix, negotiated lab discounts). By Year 5, 60% of customers are subscribers at $75/year with near-zero COGS."
- "Series A funds us to Series B or breakeven. Conservative scenario: 24-month runway. Optimistic: hit $5M ARR by Month 18, raise Series B from position of strength."

**Speaker Notes**:

- "$12M funds 24 months to scale. Biggest allocation: sales & marketing (35%)—because partner acquisition is the bottleneck."
- "We're hiring a sales team: VP Sales + 4 BDRs to close 10-15 new pilots/year. That's $4.2M, but it unlocks $20M+ in revenue."
- "Product & engineering gets 25%—we need mobile app, family screening, API integrations to scale. 3 engineers + PM + designer."
- "Clinical operations is 20%—3 genetic counselors to handle 50,000 tests. That's manageable with our group counseling and automation."
- "Regulatory/legal is 10%—FDA 510(k) if needed ($300K), state licensing ($200K), contracts. This de-risks the business."
- "By Month 24, we're at $5M ARR, 20 pilots, 50K customers—ready for Series B or breakeven."

### Slide 13: Why Now?

**Visual**: Timeline showing 3 converging trends (arrows merging)

**Headline**: **Perfect Timing: 3 Mega-Trends Converge**

**Trend 1: Genetic Testing Goes Mainstream** 🧬

- **2013**: 23andMe launches DTC testing ($99)
- **2017**: FDA approves 23andMe health reports (genetic risk for 10 conditions)
- **2020**: COVID-19 normalizes at-home testing (hundreds of millions of people mail samples)
- **2023**: Illumina launches $200 whole genome sequencing
- **2024**: 100M+ Americans have taken genetic test (23andMe, AncestryDNA, clinical)
- **Impact**: Public comfortable with genetic testing, ready for next generation (preventive, actionable)

**Trend 2: Privacy Concerns Explode** 🔐

- **2018**: GDPR (Europe), CCPA (California) pass—privacy is mainstream concern
- **2019**: 23andMe data breach (concerns about genetic data security)
- **2021**: Genetic Discrimination Act proposals in 15+ states (expand GINA to life/disability insurance)
- **2023**: Public polls: 72% fear genetic discrimination by insurers
- **2024**: Fair Underwriting patents privacy-protected framework (US 20220165374)
- **Impact**: Market demand for privacy-first genetic testing at all-time high

**Trend 3: Insurers Embrace Preventive Care** 🩺

- **2015**: ACA expands preventive care coverage (annual wellness visits, screenings)
- **2018**: Value-based care models grow (insurers rewarded for outcomes, not volume)
- **2020**: COVID-19 proves preventive care ROI (vaccines save lives + money)
- **2022**: Insurers launch wellness programs (Virgin Pulse, Livongo acquisitions)
- **2024**: Life insurers offer genetic testing pilots (but struggle with privacy → **Fair Underwriting solves this**)
- **Impact**: Insurers actively seeking genetic wellness solutions, budgets allocated

**Why Fair Underwriting Wins Now**:

- ✅ **Genetic testing is normalized** → customers willing to test
- ✅ **Privacy is a priority** → customers demand protection → Fair Underwriting's patent is the solution
- ✅ **Insurers have budgets** → wellness programs are funded → Fair Underwriting is the vendor of choice

**Timing Risk if We Wait**:

- ❌ **Competitors emerge**: Quest, LabCorp, 23andMe could launch competing platforms (we lose first-mover advantage)
- ❌ **Regulatory tightening**: FDA could regulate LDTs more strictly (harder to launch)
- ❌ **Privacy backlash**: Another genetic data breach could spook customers (market freezes)

**Speaker Notes**:

- "Timing is everything. Fair Underwriting exists at the intersection of three massive trends: genetic testing, privacy, and preventive care."
- "Genetic testing is mainstream—100M+ Americans tested. COVID normalized at-home testing. Illumina offers $200 whole genome sequencing. The tech is ready."
- "Privacy concerns are at an all-time high—72% of Americans fear genetic discrimination. GDPR, CCPA, genetic discrimination bills in 15 states. Our patent solves this."
- "Insurers are ready—they're launching wellness programs, budgets are allocated. They WANT genetic screening but didn't have a privacy-first solution. Until now."
- "If we wait, we lose. Quest or 23andMe could copy us (though they'd need our patent license). FDA could tighten regulations. Another data breach could freeze the market."
- "The window is NOW. 2025-2027 is the golden era for genetic wellness. Fair Underwriting is perfectly positioned."

- **Slides 14-15** (1 min): Investment Highlights, The Ask → close strong

**Q&A Preparation** (anticipate these questions):

1. **"How defensible is your patent? Can Quest or LabCorp work around it?"**
   - Answer: Patent covers the core innovation (insurer-funded testing without individual result access). Workarounds would be materially different (e.g., customer pays, insurer doesn't fund → worse value prop). We've consulted patent attorneys—strong IP position. If Quest/LabCorp want to enter, they'll license from us (revenue opportunity).

2. **"What if insurers build this in-house?"**
   - Answer: Unlikely—not core competency (insurers are risk managers, not genetic testing platforms). Also, our patent protects the framework. They'd need to license or build inferior alternative. Easier to partner with us.

3. **"Why will customers trust Fair Underwriting with genetic data?"**
   - Answer: Transparency + third-party validation. Privacy policy is clear ("your insurer will NOT see your results"). HIPAA-compliant, SOC 2 certified. Customer testimonials (62 NPS). Also, we're not the insurer—we're the neutral third party protecting customers FROM insurers.

4. **"What if FDA requires 510(k) for SERPINA1 testing?"**
   - Answer: We've budgeted $300K for 510(k) (included in Use of Funds). Timeline: 6-12 months. Mitigation: Labs (Quest, LabCorp) may already have 510(k) for SERPINA1—we rely on their certification. If Fair Underwriting must sponsor, we will (cost is manageable, de-risks business long-term).

5. **"How do you prevent adverse selection (only high-risk customers test)?"**
   - Answer: Insurer offers to ALL policyholders (broad population), not just high-risk. Enrollment is 5-10%—includes healthy people curious about genetics. Also, we're identifying MZ carriers BEFORE they're symptomatic (not adverse selection, it's early detection). Insurers benefit from prevention.

6. **"Why won't 23andMe or Invitae compete?"**
   - Answer: Different business models. 23andMe is DTC (customer pays $99-199, no insurance integration). Invitae is clinical (doctor-ordered, medical necessity). Fair Underwriting is B2B2C wellness (insurer pays, preventive). Also, our patent protects privacy framework—they can't replicate without licensing.

7. **"What's your customer acquisition cost (CAC) really going to be at scale?"**
   - Answer: Year 1 CAC is $600 (high partner acquisition cost spread over small customer base). By Year 5, CAC drops to $250-300 (partner acquisition cost spread over larger base, word-of-mouth referrals, operational efficiency). We track this closely—it's the key to profitability.

8. **"How do you retain customers (low churn)?"**
   - Answer: Subscriptions. One-time test has zero retention, but annual monitoring ($30-75/year) creates recurring relationship. 40-50% attach rate by Year 5. Also, MZ carriers are highly engaged (they WANT annual PFT reminders, updated research)—low churn (<10%/year).
