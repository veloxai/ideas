## Business Model Overview

### Revenue Streams

**Primary Revenue**: B2B2C — Insurance companies pay Fair Underwriting to provide genetic testing to their policyholders

1. **Per-Test Fee**: $50-150 per customer tested
   - Base test + genetic counseling + portal access
   - Pricing varies by partner size, volume commitments

2. **Annual Subscription** (optional, future): $10-30/customer/year
   - Ongoing AAT monitoring, portal access, counseling
   - Starts Year 3+ for customers who want longitudinal tracking

3. **Platform Fees** (future, Year 4+): $50K-200K/year per partner
   - API access, custom integrations, white-label portal
   - For large partners (>50K policyholders)

### Cost Structure

**Variable Costs** (per test):

- Lab test (SERPINA1 sequencing + AAT level): $25-40
- Test kit (if at-home) or lab visit: $8-15
- Genetic counseling (30-45 min session): $30-60 (blended average, not all customers need counseling)
- Customer support: $2-5
- **Total COGS**: $65-120 per test

**Fixed Costs** (monthly/annual):

- Personnel (engineers, counselors, ops, sales, G&A)
- Technology (AWS, Cloudflare, SaaS tools)
- Marketing & Sales
- Compliance & Legal
- Facilities & Other

## Unit Economics (Steady State, Year 3+)

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**B2B2C Model**: We acquire insurance partners, who provide access to their policyholders

**Partner CAC**: $50K-200K per partner

- Sales cycle: 6-12 months
- Sales & marketing expense to close 1 partner
- Amortized across enrolled customers from that partner

**Per-Customer CAC** (blended): $10-30

- Marketing to drive enrollment: $5-15 (email campaigns, portal, incentives)
- Amortized partner sales cost: $5-15 (assuming 2,000-10,000 customers per partner)

**Total Blended CAC**: $15-45 per customer enrolled

---

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Base Case** (one-time test):

- Revenue per customer: $50-150 (test fee)
- Gross margin: 30-50% (after COGS)
- Gross profit per customer: $15-75
- LTV = Gross profit = **$15-75**

**Subscription Case** (ongoing monitoring, Year 3+):

- Initial test: $50-150 revenue, $15-75 gross profit
- Annual subscription: $10-30/year revenue, $8-25/year gross profit (85% margin)
- Customer retention: 3-5 years average
- Total LTV: $15-75 (initial) + $24-125 (3-5 years subscription) = **$40-200**

**MZ Carrier Case** (highest engagement):

- Initial test: $100-150 revenue, $30-75 gross profit
- Annual subscription: $20-30/year, $17-25/year gross profit
- Retention: 5-10 years (long-term monitoring)
- Family screening: 1-2 additional tests referred (expand LTV)
- Total LTV: **$150-500**

**Blended LTV** (all customers): **$50-150** (Year 1-2), **$100-250** (Year 3-5 with subscriptions)

---

### LTV:CAC Ratio

**Year 1-2**: $50-150 LTV / $15-45 CAC = **1.1-10x** (wide range, pilots)

- Low end: Expensive partner acquisition, low enrollment, one-time tests
- High end: Efficient partner, high enrollment, engaged customers

**Year 3-5**: $100-250 LTV / $15-45 CAC = **2.2-16x** (improving with scale and subscriptions)

**Target**: 3-6x (healthy SaaS benchmark)

**Interpretation**:

- <3x: Need to improve (reduce CAC or increase LTV)
- 3-6x: Healthy, sustainable
- > 6x: Invest more in growth (CAC too low, leaving money on table)

---

### Payback Period

**CAC Payback** = Time to recover customer acquisition cost

**Calculation**:

- CAC: $15-45
- Monthly gross profit per customer: $1.25-6.25 (initial test) + $0.70-2.50/month (subscription)
- Payback period: **2-36 months**

**Target**: 12-24 months (SaaS benchmark)

**Year 1-2**: 24-36 months (longer due to one-time test model)
**Year 3-5**: 12-18 months (subscriptions accelerate payback)

**Interpretation**: Significant revenue scale, but **test revenue remains loss-leader** (subsidized by insurance partners for member benefit). Subscriptions and platform fees are high-margin but insufficient to offset test losses. **Model needs refinement**—see "Model Refinement" section below.

---

### Model Refinement: Addressing Gross Margin Challenge

**Issue**: Test revenue shows persistent **negative gross margin** due to high COGS (lab, counseling, kits) vs. low pricing ($50-150 per test).

**Strategic Options**:

1. **Increase Test Pricing**:
   - Raise per-test fee to $120-200 (currently $50-150)
   - Rationale: Insurance partners pay for member value (early detection, longevity, differentiation)
   - Risk: Partner pushback on pricing
   - **Impact**: Gross margin improves to 10-30%

2. **Reduce COGS**:
   - **Lab negotiation**: Volume discounts with Quest/LabCorp ($25-40 → $20-30)
   - **Counseling efficiency**: Automated pre-counseling education (reduce session time), group counseling sessions for normal results (reduce cost per customer)
   - **Test kit optimization**: Negotiate kit costs, explore saliva vs. blood spot (saliva cheaper)
   - **Impact**: COGS $89 → $65-75, gross margin improves to 10-25%

3. **Hybrid Pricing Model**:
   - **Freemium**: Basic test free (partner-sponsored), premium features paid (detailed ancestry, additional health insights, family screening)
   - **Risk stratification pricing**: Higher price for high-risk customers (smokers, family history), lower for low-risk
   - **Outcome-based pricing**: Bonus payments for successful interventions (MZ smoker quits smoking)

4. **Subscription-First Model**:
   - Shift from one-time test to **subscription-first** (annual genetic wellness membership)
   - Initial test included, plus annual AAT monitoring, unlimited counseling access, family screening
   - Pricing: $150-300/year (vs. $50-150 one-time)
   - **Impact**: Higher revenue, longer customer lifetime, better unit economics

**Recommended Strategy**: Combination of #1 (price increase to $100-150 average) + #2 (COGS reduction to $70-80) + #4 (introduce subscription earlier, Year 2 instead of Year 3)

---

### Revised P&L Summary (With Adjustments)

**Assumptions**:

- Test pricing: $100 average (up from $75)
- COGS: $75 average (down from $89)
- Subscriptions: Introduced Year 2 (vs. Year 3), 30% attach rate by Year 5 (vs. 60%)

| **Year** | **Revenue** | **Gross Profit** | **Gross Margin %** | **EBITDA**         | **EBITDA Margin %**                 |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Y1**   | $100K-300K  | $25K-75K         | 25%                | -$1.5M to -$2.4M   | -1,500% to -800%                    |
| **Y2**   | $1M-2.5M    | $250K-625K       | 25%                | -$2.9M to -$4.6M   | -290% to -184%                      |
| **Y3**   | $5M-10M     | $1.5M-3M         | 30%                | -$4.9M to -$7.3M   | -98% to -73%                        |
| **Y4**   | $15M-30M    | $5M-10M          | 33%                | -$7.1M to -$10.1M  | -47% to -34%                        |
| **Y5**   | $50M-100M   | $17.5M-35M       | 35%                | $-6.65M to +$-6.3M | -13% to -6% (approaching breakeven) |

**Interpretation**: With pricing and cost improvements, **gross margin positive** and **approaching EBITDA breakeven by Year 5**. Path to profitability clearer with subscription focus and operational efficiency.

**Cash Runway Analysis**:

- **Post-Seed** (Y0): 9-12 months runway → need Series A by Month 9-12
- **Post-Series A** (Y2): 18-24 months runway → need Series B by Month 18-24
- **Post-Series B** (Y4): 12-18 months runway → need Series C or profitability by Month 12-18

**Critical**: Year 5 shows potential cash deficit. Options:

1. Raise Series C ($20M-50M) in Year 5
2. Achieve profitability sooner (aggressive cost management)
3. Extend Series B size ($15M-20M vs. $5M-12M)

---

## Scenario Analysis

### Base Case (Above)

**Assumptions**:

- Moderate growth (10-15 partners by Year 3)
- Moderate pricing ($100 average test)
- Moderate enrollment (5-10% of eligible customers)
- Subscriptions 30% attach rate by Year 5

**Outcome**:

- **Year 5 Revenue**: $50M-100M
- **Year 5 EBITDA Margin**: -13% to -6% (approaching breakeven)
- **Capital Required**: $17M-30M

---

### Bull Case (High Growth)

**Assumptions**:

- Rapid partner adoption (20-25 partners by Year 3)
- Premium pricing ($125 average test, $30 average subscription)
- High enrollment (10-15% of eligible customers, driven by MZ awareness)
- Subscriptions 50% attach rate by Year 5
- Lower COGS ($65 average due to aggressive volume discounts)

**Key Metrics**:

| **Year** | **Revenue** | **Gross Margin %** | **EBITDA Margin %** |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| **Y3**   | $12M-18M    | 40%                | -40%                |
| **Y4**   | $35M-50M    | 45%                | -10%                |
| **Y5**   | $120M-180M  | 50%                | +15% (PROFITABLE)   |

**Outcome**:

- **Year 5 Revenue**: $120M-180M
- **Year 5 EBITDA**: $18M-27M (profitable!)
- **Capital Required**: $20M-35M (Series C likely for growth acceleration)
- **Valuation**: $1B+ (unicorn potential)

**Drivers**:

- MZ detection becomes standard of care (CDC, USPSTF recommendation)
- Viral growth (family screening referrals)
- Partnerships with top-10 insurers (Prudential, MetLife, Northwestern Mutual)
- Platform expansion (other genetic tests beyond AATD)

---

### Bear Case (Slow Growth)

**Assumptions**:

- Slow partner adoption (5-8 partners by Year 3)
- Lower pricing ($75 average test due to competition)
- Low enrollment (2-5% of eligible customers)
- Subscriptions 15% attach rate by Year 5
- Higher COGS ($85 average due to lower volume)

**Key Metrics**:

| **Year** | **Revenue** | **Gross Margin %** | **EBITDA Margin %** |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| **Y3**   | $2M-4M      | 15%                | -200%               |
| **Y4**   | $6M-12M     | 20%                | -100%               |
| **Y5**   | $20M-40M    | 25%                | -50%                |

**Outcome**:

- **Year 5 Revenue**: $20M-40M
- **Year 5 EBITDA**: -$10M to -$20M (still burning cash)
- **Capital Required**: $25M-40M (need Series C to survive)
- **Valuation**: $50M-150M (acquihire risk)

**Risks**:

- Partner skepticism (ROI unclear, legal concerns)
- Low enrollment (genetic testing stigma, fear of discrimination)
- Competition (23andMe, Quest/LabCorp enter space)
- Regulatory challenges (FDA requires 510(k), state licensing issues)

**Mitigation**:

- Aggressive cost management (reduce OpEx by 30-50%)
- Pivot to direct-to-consumer (DTC) model if B2B2C fails
- Focus on MZ niche (become category leader, exit to AlphaNet or pharma)

## Capital Efficiency Metrics

### Burn Multiple

**Definition**: Net burn / Net new ARR (lower is better, measures capital efficiency)

**Calculation** (Year 2 example):

- Net burn: $3.1M-5M
- Net new ARR: $700K-1.75M
- Burn multiple: **1.8-7.1x**

**Benchmark**:

- <1x: Exceptional (more revenue added than cash burned)
- 1-1.5x: Great
- 1.5-2x: Good
- 2-3x: Acceptable (early-stage)
- > 3x: Concerning (burning too much cash relative to growth)

**Fair Underwriting**: **2-3x target** (Year 2-3), improving to **<2x** (Year 4-5)

---

### Rule of 40

**Definition**: Growth rate + EBITDA margin (benchmark for SaaS health)

**Calculation** (Year 5 example, base case):

- Growth rate: 236% (Y4→Y5)
- EBITDA margin: -6%
- Rule of 40: **230%** (healthy for high-growth)

**Benchmark**:

- > 40%: Healthy
- 20-40%: Acceptable (trade-off between growth and profitability)
- <20%: Concerning (neither growing fast nor profitable)

**Fair Underwriting**: **>40%** throughout (high growth prioritized over profitability in Years 1-5)

---

## Valuation Benchmarks

### Comparable SaaS Multiples

**Public SaaS Companies** (2025 averages):

- Revenue multiple: 5-15x (median ~8x)
- Gross margin: 70-85%

| **Y5**            | $50M-100M   | 6-12x                        | **$300M-1.2B**        |

**Adjustments**:

- **Discount for negative EBITDA**: -20-40% (Years 1-4)
- **Premium for growth**: +20-50% (if >100% YoY growth)
- **Premium for strategic fit**: +30-100% (if acquisition target for pharma, insurer, or lab)

**Exit Scenarios**:

1. **IPO** (Year 6-8): $1B+ valuation (if Bull Case achieved)
2. **Strategic Acquisition** (Year 4-6): $300M-800M (acquired by Quest/LabCorp, CVS Health, or pharma company with AATD focus like Grifols, CSL Behring)
3. **Private Equity** (Year 5-7): $500M-1B (if approaching profitability, recurring revenue model)

## Investment Thesis

### Why Fair Underwriting is an Attractive Investment

**1. Large Addressable Market**:

- **MZ Carriers**: 6-10M in US (2-3% of population), mostly undiagnosed
- **Insured Population**: 170M+ with life/health insurance (potential reach)
- **TAM**: $900M-1.5B (assuming $150 per MZ carrier detected, 6-10M carriers)

**2. Unique, Defensible Position**:

- **Patent-protected privacy framework** (US 20220165374) — competitive moat
- **No direct competitors** in insurance-partnered, AATD-focused, privacy-protected space
- **First-mover advantage** in MZ carrier detection for life insurance

**3. Compelling Unit Economics**:

- **LTV:CAC ratio**: 3-6x (healthy SaaS benchmark)
- **Payback period**: 12-24 months (attractive)
- **Recurring revenue potential**: Subscriptions (90% margin) improve LTV and profitability

**4. Strong Growth Potential**:

- **400-800% YoY growth** (Years 1-3)
- **Viral expansion**: Family screening referrals (MZ carriers have 25-50% chance their first-degree relatives are also MZ)
- **Platform expansion**: Beyond AATD (add other genetic tests, lifestyle programs)

**5. Social Impact**:

- **Lives saved**: Early detection prevents lung/liver disease
- **Healthcare cost reduction**: $50K-500K per late-stage COPD/liver failure patient avoided
- **Equity**: Addresses underdiagnosis in underserved populations

**6. Exit Opportunities**:

- **Strategic acquirers**: Quest, LabCorp, CVS Health (lab consolidation)
- **Pharma**: Grifols, CSL Behring (AATD-focused, want patient data/access)
- **Insurers**: Northwestern Mutual, Prudential (in-house genetic wellness capability)
- **IPO**: If $100M+ revenue, path to public markets

## Risks & Mitigation

### Financial Risks

**1. Revenue Volatility (Partner-Dependent)**:

- **Risk**: If 1-2 large partners churn, revenue drops significantly
- **Mitigation**: Diversify partner base (aim for 10+ partners by Year 3), sign multi-year contracts

**2. Gross Margin Pressure**:

- **Risk**: COGS remains high, pricing competition, can't achieve profitability
- **Mitigation**: Negotiate volume discounts with labs, improve counseling efficiency, shift to subscription model

**3. Capital Intensity**:

- **Risk**: Need more funding than projected ($30M+ vs. $17M-30M)
- **Mitigation**: Aggressive cost management, raise larger rounds, extend runway with bridge financing

**4. Slow Path to Profitability**:

- **Risk**: Burn rate remains high, investors lose patience
- **Mitigation**: Focus on high-margin revenue (subscriptions, platform fees), reduce OpEx, demonstrate clear path to breakeven

---

### Mitigation Strategies

**Short-Term (Years 1-2)**:

- Secure Seed funding ($2M-3M) ✅
- Launch successful pilot (1K-3K customers, prove MZ detection value)
- Build repeatable sales process (standardize partner acquisition)

**Mid-Term (Years 3-4)**:

- Achieve $5M-10M revenue (prove scale)
- Launch subscriptions (improve LTV and margins)
- Expand to 10-15 partners (reduce partner concentration risk)
- Raise Series A ($10M-15M) to fuel growth

**Long-Term (Year 5+)**:

- Path to profitability (positive gross margin, approaching EBITDA breakeven)
- $50M-100M revenue scale (attractive exit valuation)
- Platform expansion (beyond AATD, become genetic wellness platform)
- IPO or strategic exit
