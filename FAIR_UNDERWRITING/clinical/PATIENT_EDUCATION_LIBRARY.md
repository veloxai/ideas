#### PAGE 1: COVER + INTRODUCTION

**Title**: Living with MZ—Your Roadmap to Health

**Subtitle**: You have one copy of the Z genetic variant. Here's what it means and how you can stay healthy.

**Introduction** (200 words):

"You've just learned that you have MZ genotype—one normal (M) copy and one variant (Z) copy of the SERPINA1 gene. This gene makes a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) that protects your lungs and liver.

**What MZ means**:

- You have **60-70% of normal AAT levels** (vs. 100% for people with MM, the most common genotype)
- You are **NOT severely deficient**—that would be ZZ genotype (10-15% AAT levels)
- Most MZ carriers live normal, healthy lives

**Your risk**:

- **If you don't smoke**: Your risk for lung disease is close to normal
- **If you smoke**: Your risk for COPD (chronic lung disease) is **2-4 times higher** than non-MZ smokers
- **Liver disease**: Slightly higher risk, especially if you have obesity, diabetes, or drink heavily

**Good news**:

- **You found out early**—most MZ carriers never learn they're at risk
- **You can reduce your risk**—smoking cessation, healthy lifestyle, and monitoring make a huge difference
- **We're here to help**—genetic counseling, resources, and support available

Let's walk through what you need to know and what you can do."

#### PAGE 2: UNDERSTANDING YOUR GENETICS

**Section Title**: How MZ Inheritance Works

**Visual**: Punnett square showing inheritance

```
     Parent 1 (M)    Parent 2 (Z)
        |                |
        M                Z
       / \              / \
      M   M            Z   Z

Your genotype: MZ (one M from one parent, one Z from the other)
```

**Key Points**:

- You inherited one M allele from one parent, one Z allele from the other
- One parent likely has MZ or ZZ genotype (they may not know—only 1-5% of carriers are diagnosed)
- Your siblings have **25-50% chance** of also being MZ (depends on parents' genotypes)
- Your children have **50% chance** of inheriting your Z allele (they'd be MZ if other parent is M, ZZ if other parent is Z/SZ)

**Action Item**: Consider sharing this information with your first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) so they can get tested if interested.

#### PAGE 3: HEALTH RISKS EXPLAINED

**Section Title**: What Are My Risks?

**Lung Disease (COPD, Emphysema)**

**Risk by Smoking Status**:

| Smoking Status                        | MZ COPD Risk vs. Normal (MM)            |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Non-smoker**                        | 1.2x (slightly higher, not significant) |
| **Current smoker**                    | **3-5x** (significantly higher)         |
| **Former smoker** (quit >5 years ago) | 1.5-2x (reduced risk)                   |

**What this means**:

- **Smoking is the game-changer**: If you don't smoke, your lung disease risk is close to normal
- **If you smoke and quit NOW**: Your risk drops dramatically—quitting is the single most important thing you can do

**Liver Disease (Cirrhosis, Liver Cancer)**

**Risk factors for MZ carriers**:

- Obesity (BMI >30): 2-3x increased cirrhosis risk
- Type 2 diabetes: 2x increased risk
- Heavy alcohol use (>2 drinks/day): 3-5x increased risk
- Age >50: Risk increases with age

**What this means**:

- **Maintain healthy weight** (BMI <25 ideal, <30 acceptable)
- **Limit alcohol** (≤1 drink/day for women, ≤2 for men)
- **Manage diabetes** (if you have it, keep blood sugar controlled)

**Environmental & Occupational Exposures**

**High-risk exposures** for MZ carriers:

- Secondhand smoke
- Air pollution (PM2.5, ozone)
- Occupational dust/fumes (welding, mining, agriculture, construction)

**What this means**:

- Avoid secondhand smoke (home, car, workplace)
- Use respiratory protection (N95 mask) if exposed to dust/fumes at work
- Consider job change if high-risk environment (e.g., welding → office work)

---

#### PAGE 4: YOUR ACTION PLAN

**Section Title**: 5 Steps to Reduce Your Risk

**Step 1: Quit Smoking** (if you smoke)

**Why**: Smoking + MZ = 3-5x higher COPD risk. Quitting reduces your risk back to near-normal.

**How**:

- Set a quit date (within next 2 weeks)
- Use nicotine replacement therapy (patch, gum, lozenge) or prescription medication (varenicline, bupropion)
- Join smoking cessation program (Smokefree.gov, Quit Genius app, or local program)
- Tell family/friends for support
- Avoid triggers (e.g., alcohol, coffee, stressful situations)

**Resources**: [Links to cessation programs]

---

**Step 2: Get Baseline Lung Function Test** (Spirometry)

**Why**: Measures how well your lungs work (FEV1, FVC). Establishes baseline so you can track changes over time.

**How**:

- Schedule appointment with your primary care doctor (PCP) or pulmonologist
- Test takes 10-15 minutes (you blow into a device that measures lung capacity)
- Repeat annually to track trends

**What to bring**: Print this handout and give to your doctor (explains MZ and why you need spirometry)

**Doctor's Letter Template**: [Included on page 8]

---

**Step 3: Get Annual Liver Function Tests** (Blood Test)

**Why**: Monitors liver health (ALT, AST, bilirubin). Detects early liver damage before symptoms.

**How**:

- Ask your PCP to order liver function tests (LFTs) at your next physical
- Repeat annually (or more often if abnormal)

**What to do if abnormal**: Your doctor may refer you to hepatologist (liver specialist) for further evaluation

---

**Step 4: Live a Healthy Lifestyle**

**Why**: Reduces risk of lung and liver disease, improves overall health.

**How**:

- **Maintain healthy weight**: BMI <25 ideal, <30 acceptable (if overweight, lose 5-10% body weight)
- **Limit alcohol**: ≤1 drink/day (women), ≤2 drinks/day (men)
- **Eat healthy**: Mediterranean diet (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, olive oil)
- **Exercise regularly**: 30 minutes moderate activity, 5 days/week (walking, biking, swimming)
- **Get vaccinations**: Flu shot annually, pneumococcal vaccine (prevents respiratory infections)

---

**Step 5: Monitor Annually**

**Why**: Early detection of lung/liver changes enables early intervention.

**How**:

- **Annual spirometry** (lung function test)
- **Annual LFTs** (liver function test)
- **Annual AAT level** (optional, tracks your AAT protein level over time)
- **Annual check-in** with Fair Underwriting genetic counselor (optional, free for MZ carriers)

**Set reminders**: Mark your calendar now for next year's tests

---

#### PAGE 5: FAMILY SCREENING

**Section Title**: Should My Family Get Tested?

**Who should consider testing**:

- **First-degree relatives** (parents, siblings, children): 25-50% chance of being MZ
- **Second-degree relatives** (grandparents, aunts/uncles, nieces/nephews): Lower chance, but still worthwhile if family history of lung/liver disease

**Why family testing matters**:

- **Early detection saves lives**: If your sibling is MZ and smokes, knowing this could motivate them to quit
- **No surprises**: Better to know and take action than to discover MZ after lung disease develops

**How to share with family**:

- "I recently had genetic testing and learned I have MZ genotype—a genetic variant that affects lungs and liver, especially if I smoke. It's inherited, so there's a chance you might have it too. Would you be interested in getting tested? Fair Underwriting offers free testing for relatives of MZ carriers."
- [Provide family screening invitation code]

**Privacy note**: It's your choice whether to share this information. Some people prefer to wait until after genetic counseling to decide how/when to tell family.

---

#### PAGE 6: GENETIC COUNSELING SUPPORT

**Section Title**: You're Not Alone—We're Here to Help

**What is genetic counseling?**

- 30-45 minute video call with licensed genetic counselor
- Discuss your MZ result, family history, health risks, action plan
- Ask questions, get personalized advice
- Free for all MZ carriers

**When to schedule counseling**:

- Within 1-2 weeks of receiving your MZ result (recommended)
- Anytime you have questions or concerns
- Before making big decisions (e.g., family planning, job change)

**How to schedule**:

- Log into Fair Underwriting portal → "Book Genetic Counseling"
- Or call [PHONE] or email [EMAIL]

**What to prepare**:

- Family health history (does anyone in your family have COPD, emphysema, liver disease?)
- Your questions (write them down beforehand so you don't forget)

---

**Ongoing Support**:

- **Email check-ins**: We'll email you at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and annually to see how you're doing
- **Portal resources**: Educational videos, articles, tools (smoking cessation tracker, BMI calculator)
- **Community**: Connect with other MZ carriers (optional support group, online forum)

---

#### PAGE 7: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Am I going to get COPD or liver disease?**

A: **Not necessarily**. Most MZ carriers live normal, healthy lives. Your risk depends on:

- **Smoking**: If you don't smoke, your COPD risk is close to normal. If you smoke, your risk is 3-5x higher—but quitting reduces it.
- **Lifestyle**: Healthy weight, limited alcohol, and no occupational exposures reduce liver disease risk.
- **Monitoring**: Annual tests catch problems early, when they're easier to treat.

**Bottom line**: MZ is manageable, not a death sentence.

---

**Q: Should I tell my doctor?**

A: **Yes**. Your doctor needs to know so they can:

- Order annual spirometry and liver function tests
- Consider MZ when diagnosing respiratory or liver symptoms
- Advise you on smoking cessation and occupational hazards

**How to tell your doctor**: Print this handout and give it to them at your next appointment. We've also included a letter template (page 8) for you to bring.

---

**Q: Will this affect my insurance?**

A: **No**. Fair Underwriting's patent-protected privacy framework ensures your genetic results are NOT shared with your insurer. You own your data. You can voluntarily share with your doctor, but you are NOT required to share with your insurer.

**Legal protections**:

- **GINA (Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act)**: Protects you from genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment
- **State laws**: Many states have additional protections

---

**Q: Can I have children?**

A: **Yes**. MZ does not affect fertility or pregnancy. However, you may want to consider:

- **50% chance** your child will inherit your Z allele (they'd be MZ if other parent has M, ZZ if other parent has Z/SZ)
- **Genetic counseling** before pregnancy (discuss family planning, partner testing, prenatal testing options)

---

**Q: Should I avoid certain jobs?**

A: **High-risk jobs** for MZ carriers include:

- Welding (metal fumes)
- Mining (dust)
- Agriculture (pesticides, dust)
- Construction (silica dust)
- Manufacturing (chemical fumes)

**If you work in one of these fields**:

- Use respiratory protection (N95 or P100 respirator)
- Ensure adequate ventilation
- Consider job change if possible (office work, retail, healthcare)

**Low-risk jobs**: Office work, healthcare (if not exposed to fumes), education, retail, technology

---

**Q: What if my liver function tests are abnormal?**

A: **Don't panic**. Slightly elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST) are common and often reversible.

**Next steps**:

1. **Repeat test** in 3 months (could be temporary)
2. **Lifestyle changes**: Lose weight, limit alcohol, control diabetes
3. **Hepatologist referral** (if persistently abnormal): Liver specialist will evaluate further (ultrasound, FibroScan, liver biopsy if needed)

**Treatment options** (if liver disease confirmed): Weight loss, medication, avoid alcohol, monitor closely

#### PAGE 8: DOCTOR'S LETTER TEMPLATE

**Section Title**: Letter to Your Healthcare Provider

[Printable template for customer to bring to doctor]

```
Dear Dr. [DOCTOR NAME],

I recently completed genetic testing through Fair Underwriting and learned that I have **MZ genotype** for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD).

**What this means**:
- I have one normal (M) allele and one deficient (Z) allele for the SERPINA1 gene
- My alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) level is approximately 60-70% of normal (vs. 10-15% for ZZ homozygotes)
- I am at increased risk for COPD (especially if I smoke) and liver disease (especially if I have obesity, diabetes, or heavy alcohol use)

**Recommendations from ATS/ERS guidelines and recent research**:
1. **Baseline spirometry** (pulmonary function test): Measure FEV1, FVC to establish baseline lung function
2. **Annual spirometry**: Monitor for accelerated lung function decline
3. **Baseline liver function tests** (ALT, AST, bilirubin, albumin): Assess liver health
4. **Annual liver function tests**: Monitor for liver disease
5. **Smoking cessation** (if applicable): Highest-priority intervention—smoking + MZ = 3-5x COPD risk
6. **Occupational counseling**: Avoid exposure to dust, fumes, chemicals (if applicable)
7. **Healthy lifestyle**: Maintain healthy weight, limit alcohol, vaccinations (flu, pneumococcal)

## Section 2: Lifestyle Guides

### 2.1 Smoking Cessation Guide for MZ Carriers

**Title**: "Quit Smoking, Protect Your Lungs—A Guide for MZ Carriers"

**Format**: 6-page PDF or web page

**Reading Level**: 8th grade

---

#### Why Quitting Matters for MZ Carriers

"If you smoke and have MZ genotype, your risk of COPD is **3-5 times higher** than non-MZ smokers. But here's the good news: **quitting works**. Studies show that MZ carriers who quit smoking have lung function decline that's close to normal.

**Your lung function trajectory**:

- **Keep smoking**: Lose 60 mL/year of lung capacity (vs. 30 mL/year for non-MZ smokers) → COPD by age 50-60
- **Quit NOW**: Lose 25 mL/year (near-normal) → avoid COPD
- **Quit before age 40**: Normal trajectory → no excess risk

**Bottom line**: Quitting is the single most important thing you can do to protect your lungs."

---

#### Your Quit Plan: 5 Steps to Success

**Step 1: Set a Quit Date** (within next 2 weeks)

- Pick a date when you'll be less stressed (not a Monday if Mondays are stressful at work)
- Tell friends/family (social support doubles quit success rate)
- Mark it on your calendar, phone, refrigerator

---

**Step 2: Choose Your Quit Method**

**Option A: Cold Turkey** (stop completely on quit date)

- **Pros**: Free, immediate
- **Cons**: Hardest (only 5-10% success rate), severe withdrawal symptoms
- **Best for**: Light smokers (<10 cigarettes/day), highly motivated

**Option B: Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)**

- **Options**: Nicotine patch, gum, lozenge, inhaler, nasal spray
- **How it works**: Provides low-dose nicotine without harmful smoke (reduces cravings, withdrawal)
- **Success rate**: 15-25% (vs. 5-10% cold turkey)
- **Recommended dose**: Start with patch (21 mg for heavy smokers, 14 mg for moderate) + gum/lozenge for breakthrough cravings
- **Duration**: 8-12 weeks, then taper
- **Cost**: $100-300 for full course (often covered by insurance)

**Option C: Prescription Medication**

- **Varenicline (Chantix)**: Blocks nicotine receptors in brain (reduces cravings + makes smoking less pleasurable)
  - **Success rate**: 30-35% (highest)
  - **How to use**: Start 1 week before quit date, take for 12 weeks
  - **Side effects**: Nausea, vivid dreams (usually mild)
  - **Cost**: $200-500 (often covered by insurance)
- **Bupropion (Wellbutrin, Zyban)**: Antidepressant that reduces cravings
  - **Success rate**: 20-25%
  - **How to use**: Start 1-2 weeks before quit date, take for 12 weeks
  - **Side effects**: Dry mouth, insomnia
  - **Cost**: $50-150 (generic available, often covered)

**Option D: Combination Therapy** (NRT + prescription medication)

- **Example**: Varenicline + nicotine patch
- **Success rate**: 35-45% (highest)
- **Recommended for**: Heavy smokers (>20 cigarettes/day), previous quit attempts failed

**Recommendation for MZ carriers**: **Option C or D** (prescription medication or combination) → highest success rate, worth the investment given your elevated risk.

---

**Step 3: Identify and Avoid Triggers**

**Common smoking triggers**:

- Coffee (morning cigarette)
- Alcohol (social smoking)
- Stress (cigarette break at work)
- After meals
- Driving
- Being around other smokers

**How to avoid**:

- Switch to tea or juice (instead of coffee) for first 2 weeks
- Avoid alcohol for first month (or limit to 1 drink)
- Take walks instead of cigarette breaks
- Chew gum or mints after meals
- Clean car, remove lighters/ashtrays
- Avoid smoker friends for first 2 weeks (or ask them not to smoke around you)

---

**Step 4: Manage Withdrawal Symptoms**

**Common withdrawal symptoms** (peak at days 3-5, subside by week 2-3):

- Cravings (intense desire to smoke)
- Irritability, mood swings
- Difficulty concentrating
- Insomnia
- Increased appetite, weight gain

**How to manage**:

- **Cravings**: Use NRT (gum, lozenge), deep breathing, distraction (walk, call a friend), drink water
- **Irritability**: Exercise (releases endorphins), meditation, warn family ("I'm quitting smoking, I might be cranky—please be patient")
- **Difficulty concentrating**: Take breaks, simplify tasks for first week
- **Insomnia**: Avoid caffeine after noon, establish bedtime routine, ask doctor for sleep aid if needed
- **Weight gain**: Healthy snacks (carrots, celery, nuts), exercise, don't worry about 5-10 lbs (you can lose it later—quitting smoking is priority)

---

**Step 5: Plan for Relapse** (it happens—don't give up!)

**Relapse statistics**: 70-80% of people relapse within first month. **This is normal.**

**If you slip (smoke 1-2 cigarettes)**:

- Don't beat yourself up ("I'm a failure") → reframe as learning experience ("What triggered this? How can I avoid next time?")
- Don't give up ("I already smoked, might as well smoke the whole pack") → recommit immediately
- Use NRT or prescription medication to get back on track

**If you fully relapse (back to daily smoking)**:

- Don't quit trying—most successful quitters tried 5-7 times before succeeding
- Analyze what went wrong (triggers? not enough support? wrong quit method?)
- Try again with different strategy (e.g., add prescription medication, join support group)

**Remember**: Each quit attempt teaches you something. You're closer to success with every try.

---

### 2.2 Liver Health Guide for MZ Carriers

**Title**: "Protect Your Liver—A Guide for MZ Carriers"

**Format**: 4-page PDF or web page

---

#### Why Liver Health Matters for MZ Carriers

"MZ carriers have **2-3x higher risk** of liver disease (cirrhosis, liver cancer) compared to non-carriers, especially if you have:

- Obesity (BMI >30): 3-4x increased cirrhosis risk
- Type 2 diabetes: 2-3x increased risk
- Heavy alcohol use (>2 drinks/day): 3-5x increased risk
- Age >50: Risk increases with age

**Good news**: Most liver disease is **preventable** with healthy lifestyle."

---

#### Your Liver Health Action Plan

**Action 1: Maintain Healthy Weight**

**Why**: Obesity → fatty liver → inflammation → cirrhosis (over 10-20 years)

**Target**:

- BMI <25 (ideal)
- BMI <30 (acceptable)
- If overweight (BMI >25), lose 5-10% of body weight (reduces fatty liver by 50%)

**How**:

- Calorie deficit: 500 calories/day → 1 lb/week weight loss
- Mediterranean diet: Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, olive oil (proven to reduce fatty liver)
- Avoid sugar-sweetened beverages (soda, juice), processed foods (high in sugar, saturated fat)
- Exercise: 30 min/day, 5 days/week (walking, biking, swimming)

**Resources**: MyFitnessPal app (track calories), Noom (weight loss coaching)

---

**Action 2: Limit Alcohol**

**Why**: Alcohol + MZ = 3-5x cirrhosis risk (alcohol is toxic to liver, MZ amplifies damage)

**Recommended limits**:

- Women: ≤1 drink/day
- Men: ≤2 drinks/day
- **Ideal for MZ carriers**: 0-3 drinks/week (minimize risk)

**What counts as "1 drink"**:

- Beer: 12 oz (1 can/bottle)
- Wine: 5 oz (1 glass)
- Spirits: 1.5 oz (1 shot)

**If you drink heavily** (>14 drinks/week for men, >7 for women):

- **Taper gradually** (don't quit cold turkey—risk of withdrawal seizures)
- **Seek support**: Alcoholics Anonymous, SMART Recovery, or addiction counselor
- **Consider medication**: Naltrexone (reduces cravings), acamprosate (reduces withdrawal)

---

**Action 3: Manage Diabetes** (if applicable)

**Why**: High blood sugar → fatty liver → liver damage

**Target**:

- HbA1c <7% (goal for people with diabetes)
- Fasting blood sugar 80-130 mg/dL

**How**:

- Take diabetes medication as prescribed
- Monitor blood sugar regularly
- Low-carb diet (reduces blood sugar spikes)
- Exercise (improves insulin sensitivity)

---

**Action 4: Get Annual Liver Function Tests**

**Why**: Detects early liver damage (before symptoms)

**What tests**:

- ALT, AST (liver enzymes—elevated if liver inflamed)
- Bilirubin (waste product—elevated if liver not functioning)
- Albumin (protein made by liver—low if liver damaged)

**When to get tested**:

- Baseline (within 3 months of learning you're MZ)
- Annually (or more often if abnormal)

**What if abnormal**:

- Repeat in 3 months (could be temporary)
- Lifestyle changes (lose weight, limit alcohol)
- Hepatologist referral (if persistently abnormal)

---

**Action 5: Avoid Liver-Toxic Medications** (when possible)

**Common medications that can harm liver**:

- Acetaminophen (Tylenol): Safe in normal doses (<3,000 mg/day), but toxic if overdose or combined with alcohol
- NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen): Can cause liver damage if used long-term
- Statins (cholesterol meds): Rarely cause liver damage, but need monitoring

**What to do**:

- Tell your doctor you're MZ (they'll monitor liver function if prescribing potentially hepatotoxic meds)
- Avoid acetaminophen + alcohol (dangerous combination)
- Use lowest effective dose of NSAIDs, shortest duration

---

#### Warning Signs of Liver Disease

**See your doctor immediately if you have**:

- Jaundice (yellowing of skin, eyes)
- Abdominal pain (upper right quadrant)
- Swelling (legs, abdomen)
- Easy bruising or bleeding
- Dark urine, pale stools
- Chronic fatigue, weakness
- Nausea, loss of appetite

**These could indicate advanced liver disease** (cirrhosis, liver failure). Early treatment improves outcomes.

---

### 2.3 Occupational Health Guide for MZ Carriers

**Title**: "Work Safe—Occupational Guidance for MZ Carriers"

**Format**: 3-page PDF

---

#### Why Occupational Exposures Matter

"MZ carriers are **more susceptible** to lung damage from workplace exposures:

- Dust (silica, wood, grain)
- Fumes (welding, metal, chemicals)
- Air pollution (diesel exhaust, ozone)

**Studies show**: MZ + occupational dust/fumes = **2-3x COPD risk** (vs. MZ with clean air jobs)"

---

#### High-Risk Jobs for MZ Carriers

**Avoid or use respiratory protection**:

- **Welding**: Metal fumes (iron, manganese, chromium) → lung damage
- **Mining**: Silica dust, coal dust → silicosis, COPD
- **Construction**: Silica dust (concrete, masonry), asbestos → lung scarring, cancer
- **Agriculture**: Pesticides, grain dust, animal dander → lung inflammation
- **Manufacturing**: Chemical fumes (solvents, paints, adhesives) → lung damage
- **Firefighting**: Smoke, combustion byproducts → lung damage

---

#### Low-Risk Jobs for MZ Carriers

**Recommended**:

- Office work (admin, finance, IT, sales)
- Healthcare (nursing, allied health—if not exposed to chemical disinfectants)
- Education (teaching, tutoring)
- Retail (sales, customer service)
- Technology (software, engineering)
- Hospitality (hotels, restaurants—if well-ventilated)

#### If You Work in High-Risk Field

**Option 1: Change Jobs** (if feasible)

- Career counseling (Fair Underwriting can connect you with vocational rehab services)
- Retraining programs (community college, online courses)
- Job search support

**Option 2: Use Respiratory Protection** (if job change not feasible)

- **N95 respirator**: Filters 95% of particles (dust, pollen) — minimum protection
- **P100 respirator**: Filters 99.97% of particles + oil-based fumes — better protection
- **Powered Air-Purifying Respirator (PAPR)**: Battery-powered fan + filter — best protection

**How to use**:

- Fit-tested (employer should provide fit testing annually—OSHA requirement)
- Worn consistently (every time exposed to dust/fumes)
- Clean and maintain (replace filters per manufacturer instructions)

**Employer responsibilities** (OSHA regulations):

- Provide respiratory protection at no cost (if exposure exceeds permissible limits)
- Train employees on proper use
- Fit-test annually

**If employer not providing**: File OSHA complaint (anonymously if desired)—call 1-800-321-OSHA

---

**Option 3: Improve Ventilation**

- Local exhaust ventilation (LEV): Captures fumes at source (e.g., welding hood)
- General ventilation (fans, open windows)
- Wet methods (water spray to reduce dust)

---

#### Know Your Rights

**Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)**:

- MZ genotype may qualify as disability (if symptomatic or regarded as impaired)
- Employer must provide reasonable accommodations (e.g., job reassignment, respiratory protection, flexible schedule for medical appointments)

**Workers' Compensation**:

- If you develop COPD/lung disease due to occupational exposure, you may be eligible for workers' comp (medical bills, lost wages, disability benefits)

**GINA (Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act)**:

- Employer cannot discriminate based on genetic information (firing, refusing to hire, demotion)
- However, GINA does NOT protect against discrimination based on **manifested disease** (if you have COPD, employer can take action)

## Section 3: FAQ Library

[Due to length constraints, I'll provide a summary structure and sample FAQs. Full library would have 50-100 FAQs.]

**Categories**:

1. **About MZ** (What is MZ? How common? How inherited?)
2. **Health Risks** (Will I get sick? What about my lungs? Liver?)
3. **Lifestyle** (Smoking, alcohol, diet, exercise, occupational)
4. **Testing & Monitoring** (Spirometry, LFTs, AAT levels)
5. **Family** (Should I tell relatives? Will my kids have MZ?)
6. **Insurance & Legal** (Will insurer know? Can I be discriminated against?)
7. **Treatment** (Is there a cure? Medications? Augmentation therapy?)

**Sample FAQs**:

**Q1: What is MZ genotype?**

A: MZ means you have one normal (M) copy and one variant (Z) copy of the SERPINA1 gene. This gene makes alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), a protein that protects your lungs and liver. With MZ, your AAT level is 60-70% of normal (vs. 100% for MM, the most common genotype).

**Q2: Will I get COPD?**

A: Not necessarily. Your COPD risk depends on:

- **Smoking**: If you don't smoke, risk is close to normal. If you smoke, risk is 3-5x higher.
- **Occupational exposures**: Dust, fumes increase risk.
- **Luck/genetics**: Even with MZ + smoking, only 15-25% develop COPD (other genes and environment matter).

**Bottom line**: Many MZ carriers live healthy lives. Quitting smoking and avoiding exposures are key.

**Q3: Is there a cure for MZ?**

A: No cure (you can't change your genes). However:

- **Prevention works**: Smoking cessation, healthy lifestyle, monitoring prevent disease.
- **Augmentation therapy** (IV AAT infusions): Available for severe AATD (ZZ), NOT recommended for MZ (your AAT level is not low enough to benefit).

**Q4: Should I tell my insurance company?**

A: **No—and you're legally protected**. Fair Underwriting's patent-protected privacy framework ensures your insurer does NOT receive your genetic results. You own your data. GINA (federal law) also prohibits health insurers and employers from discriminating based on genetic information.

**Q5: Can I join the military with MZ?**

A: **Possibly, but complicated**. US military has historically disqualified severe AATD (ZZ) but may allow MZ on case-by-case basis. Consult military recruiter and genetic counselor.

## Section 4: Video Scripts

### 4.1 Video 1: "What is Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency?" (90 seconds)

**Format**: Animated explainer video

**Script**:

[SCENE 1: DNA animation]

NARRATOR: "Inside your cells, you have DNA—your genetic blueprint. One gene, called SERPINA1, makes a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin, or AAT."

[SCENE 2: AAT protein protecting lungs]

NARRATOR: "AAT acts like a shield for your lungs. It protects them from damage caused by enzymes released by your immune system."

[SCENE 3: Z variant animation]

NARRATOR: "Some people have a genetic variant called Z. If you have one Z copy and one normal M copy—called MZ genotype—your AAT level is lower than normal: about 60-70%."

[SCENE 4: Lungs with/without AAT]

NARRATOR: "With less AAT, your lungs are more vulnerable to damage—especially if you smoke. Smoking + MZ = 3-5 times higher risk of COPD, a chronic lung disease."

[SCENE 5: Person quitting smoking, exercising]

NARRATOR: "But here's the good news: MZ is manageable. If you don't smoke, your risk is close to normal. If you quit smoking, your risk drops dramatically."

[SCENE 6: Person at doctor's office]

NARRATOR: "With annual monitoring—lung function tests and liver function tests—you can catch problems early and take action."

[SCENE 7: Fair Underwriting logo]

NARRATOR: "Fair Underwriting is here to help. Genetic counseling, resources, and support—all free for MZ carriers. You've got this."

### 4.2 Video 2: "MZ Carrier Testimonial—Sarah's Story" (2 minutes)

**Format**: Live-action testimonial

**Script**:

[SCENE: Sarah (45, office worker) sitting in living room]

SARAH: "Hi, I'm Sarah. A year ago, I learned I have MZ genotype through Fair Underwriting's testing program with my insurance company."

[SCENE: Sarah looking at laptop, surprised]

SARAH: "At first, I was scared. I thought, 'Am I going to get lung disease? What does this mean for my kids?'"

[SCENE: Sarah on video call with genetic counselor]

SARAH: "But then I spoke with a genetic counselor. She explained that MZ is manageable—especially since I don't smoke."

[SCENE: Sarah at doctor's office, getting spirometry]

SARAH: "I got baseline lung function tests. They were normal. That was a huge relief."

[SCENE: Sarah talking to her sister]

SARAH: "I told my sister, and she got tested too. Turns out, she's also MZ—and she smokes. Knowing this motivated her to quit. She's been smoke-free for 8 months now."

[SCENE: Sarah hiking with family]

SARAH: "Today, I feel empowered. I'm taking care of my health—annual tests, healthy lifestyle—and I'm helping my family do the same."

[SCENE: Sarah looking at camera]

SARAH: "If you're MZ, don't panic. You've got this. And Fair Underwriting is here to support you every step of the way."
