# AATD Mutations: Clinical Guide & MZ Heterozygote Risk Profile

**Last Updated**: November 7, 2025
**Clinical Significance**: HIGH - New research has fundamentally changed understanding of MZ carrier status

---

## Executive Summary

Recent research has revealed that **MZ heterozygotes (carriers of one Z allele) are NOT benign carriers** as previously believed. This population represents approximately 2-3% of the general population (1 in 25-40 people) and faces substantially elevated risks for lung and liver disease that warrant medical intervention and regular monitoring.

**Key Insight**: MZ status is now recognized as a significant health risk factor requiring clinical action, not merely a genetic curiosity.

## SERPINA1 Gene Variants & Clinical Phenotypes

### Normal Variants

#### PiMM (Normal)

- **Genotype**: Two wild-type M alleles
- **AAT Levels**: 100-200 mg/dL (normal range)
- **Clinical Risk**: None related to AATD
- **Prevalence**: ~90-95% of population

---

### Carrier States (Single Mutation)

#### PiMS (S Carrier)

- **Genotype**: One M allele, one S allele
- **AAT Levels**: 80-90% of normal (~120-180 mg/dL)
- **Clinical Risk**: MINIMAL
  - No significantly increased disease risk
  - Normal life expectancy
- **Prevalence**: ~5-8% of population
- **Clinical Action**:
  - Standard health maintenance
  - Family planning counseling if partner also carrier
  - No special monitoring required

#### ⚠️ PiMZ (Z Carrier) - **CLINICAL CONCERN**

- **Genotype**: One M allele, one Z allele
- **AAT Levels**: 50-60% of normal (~60-110 mg/dL)
- **Clinical Risk**: **SUBSTANTIAL**

**Lung Disease:**

- **2-4x increased risk of COPD** compared to PiMM
- Risk significantly amplified by:
  - Smoking (absolute contraindication)
  - Occupational exposures (dust, fumes, chemicals)
  - Air pollution
  - Recurrent respiratory infections
- Earlier onset of emphysema in affected individuals
- More rapid lung function decline in some patients

**Liver Disease:**

- **Elevated risk of cirrhosis** (mechanism: Z protein accumulation in hepatocytes)
- **Increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma** (liver cancer)
- Risk factors:
  - Alcohol use (should be minimized or avoided)
  - Obesity and metabolic syndrome
  - Viral hepatitis co-infection
  - Aging (risk increases with age)

**Prevalence**:

- ~2-3% of general population
- 1 in 25-40 individuals
- **~6-10 million people in the US alone**

**Why Previously Underestimated**:

- Early studies had insufficient follow-up time
- Selection bias in research cohorts
- Didn't account for environmental exposures
- Focused only on severe AATD (ZZ) outcomes
- Recent longitudinal studies with larger cohorts reveal true risk

**Clinical Action Required**:

1. **Genetic Counseling**: Understand risks, inheritance, family implications
2. **Pulmonary Function Tests**: Baseline spirometry, repeat every 1-2 years
3. **Liver Function Monitoring**: LFTs annually, imaging if abnormal
4. **Lifestyle Modifications**:
   - **Absolute smoking cessation** (if smoker)
   - Avoid secondhand smoke
   - Minimize alcohol consumption
   - Maintain healthy weight
   - Avoid hepatotoxic medications where possible
   - Use respiratory protection in occupational exposures
5. **Family Screening**: First-degree relatives should be tested
6. **Pneumococcal and influenza vaccination**: Prevent respiratory infections
7. **Regular Clinical Follow-up**: Annual evaluation with PCP or pulmonologist
8. **Consider Specialized Care**: Pulmonology referral if symptoms or declining PFTs

### Compound Heterozygotes

#### PiSZ (S + Z)

- **Genotype**: One S allele, one Z allele
- **AAT Levels**: ~40% of normal (~50-80 mg/dL)
- **Clinical Risk**: MODERATE to HIGH
  - Intermediate between MZ and ZZ
  - Clinical manifestations variable
  - Many develop lung or liver disease
- **Prevalence**: ~1 in 1,000
- **Clinical Action**:
  - Similar to MZ but more intensive monitoring
  - Consider augmentation therapy if symptomatic
  - Pulmonology and hepatology co-management

---

### Severe Deficiency States

#### PiZZ (Severe AATD)

- **Genotype**: Two Z alleles (homozygous)
- **AAT Levels**: ~15% of normal (~20-45 mg/dL)
- **Clinical Risk**: VERY HIGH
  - High risk early-onset emphysema (30s-40s)
  - Accelerated lung function decline
  - Liver disease (10-15% childhood, increased risk in adults)
  - Panniculitis and vasculitis (rare)
- **Prevalence**: ~1 in 2,500-5,000
- **Clinical Action**:
  - Specialized pulmonology care
  - Augmentation therapy eligibility evaluation
  - Liver surveillance
  - Lung transplant evaluation if severe
  - Comprehensive disease management program

#### PiSS (S Homozygous)

- **Genotype**: Two S alleles
- **AAT Levels**: ~60% of normal (~80-120 mg/dL)
- **Clinical Risk**: LOW to MINIMAL
  - Slight increased risk in combination with other risk factors
  - Generally normal life expectancy
- **Prevalence**: Rare
- **Clinical Action**: Standard care, awareness of AATD in family

#### Null Alleles & Rare Variants

- **Null Alleles**: No AAT protein produced from that allele
  - PiNull-Null: Most severe, AAT levels <10% normal
  - PiM-Null: Carrier, similar to MZ risk profile
  - PiZ-Null: Very severe, similar to ZZ
- **Rare Variants**: Numerous rare mutations (I, F, P, etc.)
  - Variable clinical impact
  - Require specialized genetic counseling
  - May cause severe deficiency or unusual presentations

## Clinical Testing Strategy

### Who Should Be Tested?

#### High Priority (Immediate Testing)

1. Patients with COPD/emphysema, especially:
   - Early onset (< 45 years)
   - Never-smokers or minimal smoking history
   - Basilar-predominant emphysema on imaging
2. Patients with unexplained liver disease
3. Adults with bronchiectasis
4. Patients with necrotizing panniculitis
5. Patients with c-ANCA positive vasculitis
6. First-degree relatives of known AATD patients

#### Moderate Priority (Consider Testing)

1. Patients with asthma with persistent airflow obstruction
2. Adults with persistent airflow obstruction in smokers
3. Family planning for known AATD families
4. Life insurance applicants via Fair Underwriting partnerships

#### Screening Populations (Public Health)

1. Newborn screening (some countries)
2. General population screening (via wellness programs)
3. Targeted screening in high-risk occupations

## Fair Underwriting Value Proposition: MZ Detection

### The Opportunity

**Market Size**:

- ~6-10 million MZ carriers in the US
- > 95% unaware of their status
- Actionable health risk requiring intervention

**Clinical Value**:

- Early identification before irreversible damage
- Lifestyle modification can significantly reduce risk
- Prevention of smoking initiation or facilitate cessation
- Occupational counseling and protective measures
- Family cascade screening

**Economic Value to Insurers**:

- **Life Insurance**: MZ carriers who smoke have significantly reduced life expectancy
  - Early intervention (smoking cessation) improves mortality outcomes
  - Healthier customers = longer premium collection period
- **Health Insurance**:
  - Preventive intervention less costly than COPD/cirrhosis treatment
  - Early detection reduces hospitalizations
  - Disease management improves quality of life and reduces costs

**Differentiation**:

- Most direct-to-consumer genetic tests do NOT include SERPINA1
- Medical testing often only performed after symptoms appear
- Fair Underwriting enables early, privacy-protected identification

## Genetic Counseling & Patient Communication

### Key Messages for MZ Carriers

**What MZ Means**:

- You have one normal copy and one abnormal (Z) copy of the SERPINA1 gene
- Your AAT levels are about 50-60% of normal
- You have increased risk for lung and liver disease, but risk is manageable

**What You Should Do**:

1. **Never smoke** (or quit immediately if you smoke)
2. Avoid secondhand smoke and air pollution
3. Minimize alcohol consumption
4. Maintain healthy weight
5. Get regular check-ups with lung and liver monitoring
6. Inform your family members so they can be tested
7. Wear respiratory protection in dusty/fume work environments
8. Get vaccinated against respiratory infections

**What About My Children?**:

- Your children have 50% chance of inheriting the Z allele
- If partner is MZ or ZZ, children at higher risk
- Genetic counseling recommended for family planning

**Prognosis with Good Management**:

- Many MZ carriers live normal, healthy lives
- Risk is manageable with lifestyle modifications
- Early awareness is key advantage
