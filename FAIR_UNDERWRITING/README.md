## 🔬 Core Value Proposition

### The Problem

- Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) affects 1 in 2,500 people
- Often undiagnosed until serious lung or liver damage occurs
- Elevated AAT levels (up to 4x normal) can signal acute illness
- Genetic discrimination concerns prevent people from testing
- Insurance companies lose money on early deaths

### The Solution

- **Quarterly/annual AAT monitoring** without genetic data disclosure
- **SERPINA1 gene mutation identification** (kept private from insurers)
- **Early detection** of AATD-related conditions
- **Real-time inflammation monitoring** (4x AAT elevation alerts)
- **Full DNA sequencing option** for comprehensive health insights
- **Zero genetic data shared** with insurance partners

### Patent Protection

Our patent specifically prohibits insurance companies from accessing SERPINA1A gene data for actuarial calculations, creating a legal framework for genetic privacy in this context.
