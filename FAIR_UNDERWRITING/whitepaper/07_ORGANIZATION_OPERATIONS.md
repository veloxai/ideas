- Decision-making by consensus (founders have final say)
- Move fast, break things (except HIPAA compliance)

**Hiring Process**:

- Founders personally interview every candidate (3-5 rounds)

## Culture & Values

### Core Values

**1. Privacy First, Always**

- Patient owns 100% of genetic data
- Never compromise privacy for revenue (no data sales without explicit consent)
- HIPAA compliance is non-negotiable (even if it slows us down)

**2. Clinical Excellence**

- Board-certified genetic counselors only (no chatbots replace human counselors)
- Evidence-based care (follow ACMG guidelines)
- Patient safety over speed (never rush diagnoses)

**3. Transparency**

- Open communication (default to sharing information, not hoarding)
- Honest feedback (constructive criticism expected and welcomed)
- Financial transparency (share revenue, burn rate with team monthly)

**4. Move Fast (But Don't Break HIPAA)**

- Startup speed (2-week sprints, ship features fast)
- Healthcare rigor (security reviews, compliance checks before launch)
- Balance: Innovate aggressively within healthcare regulations

**5. Patient-Centric**

- Every decision asks: "Is this good for patients?"
- Customer feedback drives roadmap (not what's cool technically)
- Empathy for patients (many are dealing with serious genetic diagnosis)

### Communication Rituals

**Daily**: Standup (15 min, async in Slack for remote team)
**Weekly**: Department syncs (1 hour, each department)
**Bi-Weekly**: All-hands (1 hour, CEO presents metrics, demos, wins)
**Monthly**: Executive team meeting (2 hours, CEO + VPs discuss strategy)
**Quarterly**: OKR planning (half-day offsite, set company/department OKRs)
**Annual**: Company offsite (2-3 days, team building, strategy)

### Remote Work Policy

**Stage 1-2** (0-15 people): Office-first (SF Bay Area)
**Stage 3-4** (15+ people): Hybrid (3 days in office, 2 days remote)
**Future** (50+ people): Remote-friendly (hire anywhere in US, with hubs in SF, NYC, Austin)

## Performance Management

### Quarterly OKRs (Objectives & Key Results)

**Process**:

1. **Week 1 of Quarter**: CEO sets company OKRs (3-5 objectives)
2. **Week 2**: Departments cascade OKRs (align to company OKRs)
3. **Week 3**: Individuals set personal OKRs (align to department OKRs)
4. **Week 6** (Mid-Quarter): Check-in (on track? Need support?)
5. **End of Quarter**: Score OKRs (0-100%), conduct retrospective

**Example OKRs** (Company-Level, Q1 Year 1):

- **Objective**: Launch MVP and sign 2 pilot partners
  - **KR1**: Deploy MVP to production by March 31 (100% = shipped, 0% = not shipped)
  - **KR2**: Sign 2 pilot partners ($300K contracted revenue) (100% = 2 signed, 50% = 1 signed)
  - **KR3**: Pass penetration test with zero critical vulnerabilities (100% = passed, 0% = failed)

### Annual Performance Reviews

**Timeline**: January (review previous year)

**Process**:

1. Employee self-assessment (rate performance 1-5, list accomplishments)
2. Manager assessment (rate performance, provide feedback)
3. Peer feedback (360 review for managers/senior ICs)
4. 1-on-1 discussion (manager + employee, 60 min)

**Performance Ratings**:

- **5 - Exceeds Expectations**: Consistently 80%+ OKR achievement, high impact, promotion candidate
- **4 - Meets Expectations**: Consistently 60-80% OKR achievement, solid contributor
- **3 - Needs Improvement**: <60% achievement, performance concerns (PIP if persistent)
- **2 - Underperforming**: Serious issues (PIP immediately)
- **1 - Failing**: Termination

**Compensation Adjustments** (March, after reviews):

- **Exceeds**: 8-12% merit raise + promotion (10-20% raise) if applicable
- **Meets**: 3-5% merit raise
- **Needs Improvement**: 0-2% raise or no raise
