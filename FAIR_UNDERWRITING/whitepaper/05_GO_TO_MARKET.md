## Target Customer Segmentation

### Segment 1: Self-Insured Employers (Year 1 Focus) ⭐

**Profile**:

- Large employers (5K-50K employees) who self-fund health benefits
- Examples: Boeing, General Motors, Amazon, Walmart, universities

**Why Prioritize**:

- **Faster Sales Cycles**: 6-9 months (vs. 12-18 for insurers)
- **Decision Maker Accessibility**: VP HR / Benefits Director (not C-suite)
- **Cost-Conscious**: Directly pay claims, motivated by cost savings
- **Innovation-Friendly**: Can pilot new programs faster (no regulatory approval)

**Pain Points**:

- Rising healthcare costs (8-10% annual increase)
- Employee retention and wellness initiatives
- Quality metrics for self-insured health plans

**Value Proposition**:

- **ROI**: Early AATD detection saves $100K+ per patient in avoided late-stage costs
- **Employee Value**: Free genetic testing is attractive benefit (recruitment/retention)
- **Easy Pilot**: Start with 100-200 high-risk employees, expand if successful

**Examples**:

- Boeing: 140K employees, self-insured, wellness program budget $20M/year
- State of California: 200K employees, self-insured, looking for cost containment

**Target**: 5 pilots in Year 1

### Segment 2: Regional Health Plans (Year 1-2 Focus)

**Profile**:

- Non-profit or regional insurers (100K-2M members)
- Examples: Premera Blue Cross (WA), Highmark (PA), HCSC (IL, TX)

**Why Prioritize**:

- **Quality Focus**: Regional plans compete on quality (not just price)
- **Innovation Budget**: $5-10M/year for new programs
- **Local Relationships**: Strong ties to local providers, employers

**Pain Points**:

- Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) targets (80-85% of premiums must go to care)
- HEDIS/Star Ratings quality metrics
- Member retention (compete with national plans)

**Value Proposition**:

- **Quality Improvement**: AATD early detection improves HEDIS scores
- **Cost Savings**: Reduce MLR through prevention
- **Differentiation**: "We offer genetic testing wellness benefit" (competitive advantage)

**Examples**:

- Highmark (PA): 6M members, $20B revenue, innovation-focused CMO
- Premera (WA): 2M members, wellness programs for chronic disease

**Target**: 5 more partners in Year 2 (10 total)

### Segment 3: National Health Plans (Year 2-3 Focus)

**Profile**:

- Top 10 insurers (10M-50M members)
- Examples: UnitedHealth, Anthem, Cigna, Aetna, Humana

**Why Later**:

- **Slower Sales Cycles**: 12-18 months (enterprise procurement)
- **Higher Bar**: Need proven case studies, references from regional plans
- **Complex Integration**: More technical requirements (APIs, security audits)

**Pain Points**:

- Brand differentiation (all offer similar benefits)
- Value-based care contracts with providers
- Member engagement and satisfaction

**Value Proposition**:

- **Scale**: Roll out to 10M+ members (huge impact)
- **Competitive Advantage**: "Only national insurer offering genetic wellness benefit"
- **Data Insights**: Aggregate data improves population health strategies

**Examples**:

- UnitedHealth: 50M members, $300B revenue, innovation labs
- Anthem: 45M members, value-based care focus

**Target**: 10 more partners in Year 3 (20 total)
