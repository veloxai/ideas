## Part 1: Disease Epidemiology & Patient Population

### What is Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD)?

**Medical Overview**:

- **Genetic Basis**: Mutation in SERPINA1 gene (chromosome 14), autosomal codominant inheritance
- **Protein Deficiency**: Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein protects lungs from neutrophil elastase damage
- **Primary Organs Affected**:
  - **Lungs**: Emphysema, COPD, bronchiectasis (80% of patients)
  - **Liver**: Cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (10-15% of patients)
  - **Skin**: Panniculitis (rare, <1%)

**Genotypes**:

- **PiZZ** (severe): <15% normal AAT levels, high risk for lung/liver disease
- **PiSZ** (moderate): 30-40% normal AAT levels, moderate risk
- **PiMZ** (carrier): 50-60% normal AAT levels, low-moderate risk
- **PiMM** (normal): 100% normal AAT levels, no increased risk

### Prevalence & Epidemiology

**United States**:

- **Diagnosed Patients**: ~100,000 individuals with severe deficiency (PiZZ, PiSZ)
- **Undiagnosed Patients**: ~3,000,000 total (including carriers)
- **Carrier Frequency**: 1 in 25 Americans carry one defective gene (PiMZ)
- **Severe Deficiency**: 1 in 2,500 Americans (PiZZ genotype)

**Global**:

- **Worldwide Prevalence**: 3-4 million people with severe deficiency
- **Geographic Concentration**: Highest in Northern European descent (Scandinavian, Irish, British, German)
- **Underdiagnosis**: WHO estimates only 5% of affected individuals are diagnosed worldwide

**Demographics**:

- **Age at Diagnosis**: Median age 45 (lung symptoms), 30s (liver symptoms)
- **Gender**: Equal male/female ratio for genetic inheritance, males more likely diagnosed (higher smoking rates)
- **Ethnicity**: More common in Caucasians (1 in 2,500) vs. African Americans (1 in 20,000) or Asians (very rare)

### Clinical Manifestations & Natural History

**Lung Disease Progression** (80% of patients):

- **Early Symptoms** (age 20s-30s): Shortness of breath, wheezing, chronic bronchitis (often misdiagnosed as asthma)
- **Mid-Stage** (age 40s-50s): COPD diagnosis, reduced lung function (FEV1 decline 50-100 mL/year)
- **Late-Stage** (age 50s-60s): Severe emphysema, oxygen dependence, lung transplant consideration
- **Risk Factors**: Smoking (10-20 year earlier disease onset), occupational exposures (dust, chemicals), air pollution

**Liver Disease Progression** (10-15% of patients):

- **Childhood** (10% of PiZZ): Neonatal cholestasis, cirrhosis by age 5-10
- **Adulthood** (10-15% of PiZZ): Cirrhosis, portal hypertension, hepatocellular carcinoma (5-10% risk)
- **Risk Factors**: Alcohol consumption, hepatitis C co-infection, obesity/fatty liver

**Life Expectancy**:

- **Without Smoking**: Near-normal life expectancy with early detection and management
- **With Smoking**: Median survival 50-60 years (10-20 years shorter than non-smokers)
