## Cost Structure

### Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

**Direct Costs per Test**:

- Lab testing (Quest/LabCorp): $50 per test
- Genetic counseling: $150 per patient (2 sessions × 30 min × $150/hr counselor rate)
- Platform infrastructure (AWS, hosting): $10 per patient per year
- **Total COGS**: $210 per patient tested

**Gross Margin Calculation** (Average Partner):

- Revenue: $400K per year
- Tests: 1,000 patients tested (assumes 20% uptake from 5,000 member population)

## Unit Economics

### Insurance Partner Unit Economics

**Average Partner** (Year 3 mature state):

- **Annual Contract Value (ACV)**: $400K
- **COGS**: $100K (testing + counseling + platform for 1,000 patients)
- **Gross Profit**: $300K (75% margin)
- **Allocated OpEx**: $50K (CSM, support, sales/marketing allocation)
- **Net Profit**: $250K per partner per year

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**:

- Sales cost: $50K per partner (VP Sales + AE time, ~6 months sales cycle)
- Marketing cost: $10K per partner (events, content, ads to generate leads)
- **Total CAC**: $60K per partner

**Lifetime Value (LTV)**:

- Average partner lifetime: 5 years (90% annual retention = ~5-year average tenure)
- Average annual revenue: $400K (grows from $150K Year 1 → $400K Year 3)
- Gross profit per year: $300K (75% margin)
- **LTV**: 5 years × $300K = **$1.5M gross profit lifetime**
- Net of allocated OpEx ($50K/year): $1.5M - $250K = **$1.25M net profit lifetime**

**LTV:CAC Ratio**:

- Gross LTV:CAC = $1.5M / $60K = **25:1** (excellent, >3:1 is good)
- Net LTV:CAC = $1.25M / $60K = **21:1**
- Conservative LTV:CAC (3-year horizon): $900K / $60K = **15:1** (still excellent)

**Payback Period**:

- CAC: $60K
- Monthly gross profit: $25K (Year 1 $150K ACV × 75% margin / 12 = $9.4K, grows to $25K by Year 3)
- Payback: $60K / ($25K/month) = **2.4 months** (Year 3)
- Year 1 payback: $60K / $9.4K = **6.4 months**
- Average payback: **~3-4 months** (excellent, <12 months is good)

## Path to Profitability

### Breakeven Analysis

**Breakeven = Revenue = Costs**

**Year 1** (Month 12):

- Revenue: $1.5M ARR (run rate)
- Costs: $2.1M (full-year OpEx)
- **Net Loss**: -$600K (41% loss margin)

**Year 2** (Month 24):

- Revenue: $4M ARR (run rate)
- Costs: $4.4M (full-year OpEx)
- **Net Loss**: -$400K (10% loss margin, approaching breakeven)

**Year 3 Q2** (Month 30):

- Revenue: $7M ARR (run rate at Month 30, 15 partners)
- Costs: $7M (quarterly run rate of OpEx)
- **Breakeven Achieved** (0% margin)

**Year 3 Q4** (Month 36):

- Revenue: $10M ARR (run rate)
- Costs: $9M (full-year OpEx)
- **Net Profit**: $1M (10% profit margin)

---

### Cash Flow & Burn Rate

**Funding Requirement**:

- **Seed**: $2.5M (Months 0-12)
  - MVP development: $600K
  - 5 pilots: $1M (COGS + sales/marketing)
  - Operating costs: $900K (payroll, office, software)
- **Optional Series A**: $5M (Months 12-18, if raised)
  - Accelerate growth: Hire faster (VP Marketing, more AEs)
  - Expand product: Build research platform, international (Canada/UK)
  - Extend runway: 18-24 months of runway (vs. 12 months on seed only)

**Burn Rate**:

- **Year 1**: $175K/month average ($2.1M / 12 = $175K)
- **Year 2**: $200K/month average ($4.4M - $4M revenue = $400K loss / 12 = $33K, but revenue ramps throughout year, so monthly burn varies)
- **Year 3**: $0-50K/month average (approaching profitability)

**Cash Runway** (Seed-Only Scenario):

- Seed raise: $2.5M (Month 0)
- Burn Year 1: $2.1M (end Month 12, $400K cash remaining)
- Burn Year 2 H1: $1.2M (end Month 18, -$800K = need bridge round OR cut costs OR raise Series A Month 12-15)

**Cash Runway** (Seed + Series A Scenario):

- Seed raise: $2.5M (Month 0)
- Series A raise: $5M (Month 15, after 10 partners signed)
- Total capital: $7.5M
- Burn: $2.1M (Year 1) + $2.2M (Year 2 H1) + $2.2M (Year 2 H2) = $6.5M by Month 24
- Remaining: $1M cash (Month 24)
- Year 3 revenue: $10M covers $9M costs, generates $1M profit
- **No additional funding needed** (Series A was last round)

## Sensitivity Analysis

### Best-Case Scenario (+30% upside)

**Assumptions**:

- Sales execution strong (30% close rate vs. 20% base case)
- Renewals 100% (no churn)
- Faster expansion (100% expand vs. 80% base case)
- Pharma partnerships early (Year 2 $1M vs. $500K base case)

**Revenue**:

- Year 1: $2M ARR (7 pilots vs. 5)
- Year 2: $5.5M ARR (15 partners vs. 10, pharma $1M)
- Year 3: $13M ARR (25 partners vs. 20, pharma $3M)

**Profitability**: Month 24 (vs. Month 30 base case)

**Exit**: $200M-400M valuation (vs. $100M-300M base case)

---

### Base-Case Scenario (presented throughout this chapter)

**Revenue**: $1.5M → $4M → $10M ARR
**Profitability**: Month 30 breakeven, Month 36 $1M profit
**Exit**: $100M-300M valuation

---

### Downside Scenario (-30%)

**Assumptions**:

- Sales struggles (15% close rate)
- Churn high (80% renewal rate)
- Slow expansion (50% expand)
- Pharma delayed (Year 3 only)

**Revenue**:

- Year 1: $1M ARR (3 pilots vs. 5)
- Year 2: $2.5M ARR (6 partners vs. 10)
- Year 3: $6M ARR (12 partners vs. 20)

**Profitability**: Month 42+ (need additional funding or cost cuts)

**Mitigation**:

- Cut costs (reduce headcount 15-20%, extend profitability timeline)
- Raise bridge round ($1-2M Month 18-24)
- Pivot to direct-to-consumer (DTC) if B2B2C fails (risky, changes entire model)

---

## Funding Strategy

### Seed Round ($2.5M)

**Timing**: Months -6 to 0 (3-6 month fundraise)

**Use of Funds**:

- Product development (MVP): $600K (engineers, designer, infrastructure)
- First 5 pilots: $1M (COGS $200K + sales/marketing $300K + CSM $200K + genetic counselors $300K)
- Operations: $900K (CEO, CTO, Medical Director, office, software)

**Milestones to Achieve**:

- MVP launched (auth, testing, telemedicine, mobile apps)
- 5 pilots signed ($1.5M ARR)
- 500 patients tested
- Product-market fit validated (NPS >60, 40% uptake, 3:1 ROI)

**Investors**:

- Healthcare VCs (a16z Bio, Thrive, Oak HC/FT)
- Angels (healthcare entrepreneurs, genetic testing founders, insurance execs)
- Accelerators (Y Combinator, StartX, Techstars Healthcare)

**Terms**:

- Valuation: $7.5M-10M post-money ($5M-7.5M pre-money)
- Equity: 25-33% dilution
- Liquidation preference: 1× (standard)

---

### Optional Series A ($5M)

**Timing**: Months 12-18 (after 5 pilots proven, before cash runs out)

**Decision Criteria** (Raise Series A if...):

- **Scenario 1**: Pilots succeed 100%, want to grow faster (hire 5 AEs vs. 2, expand to Canada/UK Year 2)
- **Scenario 2**: Cash runway <6 months, need bridge to profitability
- **Scenario 3**: Market opportunity larger than expected (national health plans want to sign Year 2, need resources to support)

**Use of Funds**:

- Sales scale: $1.5M (hire 3 more AEs, 2 BDRs, Sales Ops, VP Marketing)
- Product expansion: $1.5M (research platform, international Canada/UK, EHR integrations)
- Operations: $2M (extend runway 18 months, pay for OpEx while revenue ramps)

**Milestones to Achieve**:

- 10 partners ($4M ARR)
- 2,000 patients tested
- Research platform launched (500+ registry)
- Breakeven in 12-18 months (Month 30-36)

**Investors**:

- Healthcare growth VCs (General Catalyst, Andreessen Horowitz, GV)
- Strategic investors (insurance companies, pharma venture arms)

**Terms**:

- Valuation: $20M-30M post-money ($15M-25M pre-money)
- Equity: 20-25% dilution
- Pro rata rights for seed investors (anti-dilution protection)

---

### Series B ($10M+) or Exit (Year 4-5)

**Scenario 1: Raise Series B** (if want to grow to $50M-100M+ ARR):

- Timing: Month 36-48 (after profitability proven)
- Use: Expand to 100+ insurance partners, international (EU, Asia), build direct-to-consumer (DTC)
- Valuation: $60M-100M post-money (6-10× Year 3 ARR)

**Scenario 2: Strategic Acquisition** (most likely exit):

- Timing: Month 36-60 (after $10M-20M ARR proven)
- Acquirers: Genetic testing companies (Invitae, Myriad, Color), insurance tech (Oscar, Clover, Devoted), pharma (CSL Behring, Grifols)
- Valuation: $100M-300M (10-30× Year 3 ARR, 3-5× Year 5 ARR)
- Investor returns: 10-30× on seed (assumes $100M-300M exit on $10M post-money seed valuation = 25-33% ownership × $100M-300M = $25M-100M return on $2.5M invested)
