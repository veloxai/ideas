## Problem Statement

### The Crisis: 95% of AATD Patients Remain Undiagnosed

**Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD)** is a genetic condition affecting approximately **1 in 2,500 Americans** (100,000 diagnosed, 3 million with genetic variants). Despite being one of the most common genetic conditions, **95% of affected individuals remain undiagnosed** due to:

1. **Lack of Awareness**: Primary care physicians rarely test for AATD (only 5% of medical schools teach AATD genetics)
2. **Genetic Discrimination Fears**: Patients fear testing will affect life insurance, disability insurance, and employment (GINA only protects health insurance, not other coverage)
3. **Fragmented Care**: No integrated platform exists for AATD testing, genetic counseling, telemedicine, and longitudinal care coordination
4. **High Cost Barrier**: Direct-to-consumer genetic tests cost $199-299 out-of-pocket, creating socioeconomic disparities in access

### Health & Economic Consequences

**Clinical Impact**:

- **7.2 year average diagnosis delay** (patients see 3-5 specialists before diagnosis)
- **80% develop lung disease** (COPD, emphysema) by age 50-60 if undiagnosed
- **10-15% develop liver disease** (cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma)
- **20-year reduced life expectancy** if untreated (vs. 5-year reduction if diagnosed early)

**Economic Burden**:

- **$2M-5M lifetime cost per patient** (lung transplants $500K-1M, augmentation therapy $100K-150K/year, chronic care)
- **$100B total US burden** across all 3M patients with AATD variants
- **$100K+ savings per patient** from early detection (prevent lung damage, avoid ICU, delay or prevent transplant)

### Health Equity Disparities

**Current genetic testing access disproportionately excludes**:

- **Low-income populations**: Cannot afford $199-299 DTC tests
- **Rural communities**: Lack access to genetic counselors (80% of counselors in urban areas)
- **Minority populations**: AATD is prevalent across all ethnicities (African American 1 in 6,000, Hispanic 1 in 3,500, Caucasian 1 in 2,000), but testing rates <5% for non-Caucasian populations
- **Uninsured/underinsured**: 28M Americans uninsured, cannot access genetic testing through traditional healthcare

**Fair Underwriting addresses health equity by**:

- Partnering with insurance companies and employers to provide **free genetic testing** (removes cost barrier)
- **Telemedicine-first** genetic counseling (accessible from rural areas, no travel required)
- **Mobile-first platform** (accessible via smartphone, no computer required)
- **Multi-language support** (Spanish, Mandarin, Vietnamese planned Year 2-3)
- **Community health center partnerships** (Year 2-3, reach uninsured populations)

## Evaluation Plan

### Primary Outcomes (3-Year Evaluation)

**Clinical Outcomes**:

1. **Number of AATD patients diagnosed**: Target 500-1,000 (vs. 50-100 with usual care)
2. **Time to diagnosis**: Target <6 months (vs. 7.2 years usual care)
3. **% patients starting treatment**: Target 60-80% (augmentation therapy or smoking cessation or pulmonology referral)
4. **Lung function stability**: Target 50-60% maintain FEV1 ≥80% predicted (vs. 20-30% decline with usual care)

**Health Equity Outcomes**:

1. **% minority patients tested**: Target 30% (vs. <5% usual care)
2. **% rural patients tested**: Target 20% (vs. <10% usual care)
3. **% Medicaid patients tested**: Target 15% (vs. <5% usual care)
4. **Patient satisfaction (NPS)**: Target >70 (vs. 40-50 usual care)

**Research Outputs**:

1. **Number of peer-reviewed publications**: Target 3-5
2. **Number of conference presentations**: Target 5-10
3. **Registry size**: Target 5,000-10,000 patients
4. **Pharma partnerships**: Target 3-5 partnerships, $2M-5M revenue

**Economic Outcomes**:

1. **Healthcare cost savings**: Target $50M-100M (500-1,000 patients × $100K savings each)
2. **Cost per diagnosis**: Target $3K-5K (vs. $50K-100K usual care with multiple specialists, ER visits)
3. **ROI for insurance partners**: Target 3:1 (save $3 for every $1 spent on testing)

---

### Data Collection & Analysis

**Quantitative Data**:

- Patient demographics, genotype, clinical outcomes (spirometry, labs, imaging)
- Healthcare utilization (ER visits, hospitalizations, specialist visits, medications)
- Patient-reported outcomes (SF-36, SGRQ, symptom diaries)
- Wearables data (steps, heart rate, oxygen saturation, sleep quality)

**Qualitative Data** (optional, for mixed-methods evaluation):

- Patient interviews (N=20-30): experiences with genetic testing, counseling, care coordination
- Provider interviews (N=10-15): genetic counselors, pulmonologists, primary care physicians
- Insurance partner interviews (N=5-10): benefits leaders, medical directors

**Statistical Analysis**:

- **Descriptive statistics**: Mean, median, standard deviation for continuous outcomes (FEV1, cost savings)
- **Inferential statistics**: T-tests, ANOVA for group comparisons (early-diagnosed vs. late-diagnosed)
- **Survival analysis**: Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox proportional hazards models for mortality, lung transplant
- **Longitudinal analysis**: Mixed-effects models for repeated measures (FEV1 over time)
- **Cost-effectiveness analysis**: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)

**Software**: R, Python, SAS, SPSS

## Ethical Considerations & Human Subjects Protection

### IRB Approval

**IRB**: Western IRB (commercial IRB for multi-site studies) or local institutional IRBs for partner sites

**Submission Timeline**: Month 1-2 (before patient enrollment)

**Study Type**: Minimal risk (genetic testing is standard of care for high-risk individuals, platform is observational registry)

---

### Informed Consent

**Consent Process**:

1. Patient receives opt-in invitation from insurance company or primary care provider
2. Patient logs into Fair Underwriting platform, reads informed consent document (IRB-approved)
3. Patient watches 5-minute video explaining genetic testing, privacy, risks/benefits
4. Patient completes comprehension quiz (5 questions, must score 80%+)
5. Patient electronically signs consent (name + date + IP address logged)
6. Patient can revoke consent anytime (via app, phone, email)

**Consent Elements** (per 45 CFR 46.116):

- Study purpose (build AATD patient registry, improve care)
- Procedures (genetic testing, counseling, longitudinal surveys)
- Risks (genetic discrimination fears, privacy breach risk, psychological distress from results)
- Benefits (free genetic testing, personalized care, contribute to research)
- Confidentiality (HIPAA protections, encryption, de-identification)
- Voluntary participation (can withdraw anytime, no penalty)
- Contact information (PI, IRB, privacy officer)

**Special Populations**:

- **Pregnant women**: Not excluded (AATD testing safe during pregnancy), but liver disease counseling may differ
- **Prisoners**: Excluded (not eligible for insurance partner programs)
- **Children <18**: Excluded (Year 1-3 focus on adults, pediatric AATD expansion Year 4+)

---

### Privacy & Confidentiality

**HIPAA Compliance**:

- Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with all vendors (AWS, Twilio, Salesforce)
- Encryption at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Access controls (role-based access, multi-factor authentication, audit logs)
- Breach notification plan (notify OCR + affected patients within 60 days)

**Genetic Privacy**:

- **GINA protections**: Patients informed that GINA protects health insurance and employment, but NOT life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance
- **State laws**: Comply with state genetic privacy laws (California GINA, New York GINA, etc.)
- **Patient-controlled data sharing**: Patients decide who sees their genetic data (family members, providers, researchers, pharma companies)

**De-identification**:

- Research datasets de-identified per HIPAA Safe Harbor (remove 18 identifiers: name, address, dates, phone, email, etc.)
- K-anonymity (each record indistinguishable from at least k-1 other records, k=5 minimum)

---

### Risks to Participants

**Risk 1: Genetic Discrimination**

- **Likelihood**: Low (GINA protects health insurance and employment)
- **Mitigation**: Educate patients about GINA protections and limitations, recommend patients not share results with life insurance companies unless required

**Risk 2: Psychological Distress**

- **Likelihood**: Low-Moderate (10-15% of patients experience anxiety after positive AATD diagnosis)
- **Mitigation**: Pre-test genetic counseling (discuss implications), post-results genetic counseling (emotional support), referral to mental health services if needed

**Risk 3: Privacy Breach**

- **Likelihood**: Very Low (<1%, if security controls properly implemented)
- **Mitigation**: Penetration testing, SOC 2 audit, cyber insurance, incident response plan

**Risk 4: Family Implications**

- **Likelihood**: Moderate (50% of patients share results with family members, may cause family conflict or guilt)
- **Mitigation**: Family counseling offered (discuss how to talk to relatives about genetic testing), family health records tool (help relatives get tested)
