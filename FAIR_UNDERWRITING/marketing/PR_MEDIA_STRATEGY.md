Hi [Journalist Name],

I loved your recent article on [topic]. I'm reaching out because I think you'd be interested in Fair Underwriting—we're a startup enabling life insurers to offer genetic testing to policyholders without violating privacy (patent-protected).

We just closed our Series A and have compelling data: 34% of MZ carriers in our pilots quit smoking (vs. 6% baseline). That's a 5.7x improvement—and it's preventing thousands in future COPD costs.

Would you be interested in covering this? Happy to set up a call with our CEO or share exclusive data.

2. **Genetic discrimination lawsuit** (customer claims Fair Underwriting enabled discrimination)
3. **Test error** (lab incorrectly reports genotype, customer harmed)
4. **Negative press** ("Fair Underwriting is just another 23andMe—insurers will use data against you")
5. **FDA regulatory action** (FDA cracks down on LDTs, Fair Underwriting forced to halt testing)

---

### Crisis Response Protocol

**Step 1: Assess (Within 1 Hour)**

- **Severity**: Is this a PR annoyance (negative tweet) or existential threat (data breach, lawsuit)?
- **Facts**: What actually happened? (Don't speculate—gather facts first)
- **Stakeholders**: Who's affected? (customers, partners, employees, investors, press)

**Step 2: Assemble Crisis Team (Within 2 Hours)**

- **Team**: CEO, CFO, General Counsel (if hired), PR lead (or consultant)
- **War room**: Conference call or in-person meeting (assess situation, draft response)

**Step 3: Internal Communication (Within 4 Hours)**

- **Employees**: Email all employees with facts, response plan, talking points (don't let them learn from press)
- **Board**: Notify board chair, key investors (they'll hear from press—want to hear from CEO first)

**Step 4: External Communication (Within 6-24 Hours, depending on severity)**

**For Major Crisis** (data breach, lawsuit—within 6 hours):

- **Press statement**: Acknowledge issue, express concern, outline response (don't hide or delay)
- **Customer communication**: Email affected customers (if data breach, offer credit monitoring)
- **Media**: Proactive outreach to key journalists (offer CEO interview, demonstrate transparency)

**For Minor Crisis** (negative press, small issue—within 24 hours):

- **Monitor**: Track social media, press coverage (Muck Rack, Google Alerts)
- **Respond selectively**: If false claims, correct the record (statement, letter to editor, social media)
- **Don't amplify**: If obscure blog post, may not warrant response (responding could make it bigger)

**Crisis Statement Template**:

```
Fair Underwriting Statement on [Issue]

[DATE] – We are aware of [issue]. We take this matter extremely seriously and are conducting a thorough investigation.

[If customer harm]: Our top priority is the wellbeing of our customers. We are [specific action—e.g., offering free credit monitoring, correcting test results, etc.].

[If data breach]: We have contained the breach and are working with cybersecurity experts to ensure this does not happen again. We are notifying affected customers and have reported the incident to HHS as required by HIPAA.

[If regulatory issue]: We are working closely with [FDA, state regulators] and are committed to full compliance with all regulations.

We will provide updates as we learn more. Customers with questions can contact [email/phone].

[CEO Name], CEO
Fair Underwriting
```

**Step 5: Post-Crisis (Within 1-2 Weeks)**

- **Transparency report**: Publish detailed post-mortem (what happened, root cause, how we fixed it, how we'll prevent recurrence)
- **Media follow-up**: Offer CEO interviews to show accountability, rebuilding trust
- **Customer outreach**: Survey customers (NPS, trust score), address concerns
- **Process improvements**: Update policies, technology, training to prevent recurrence

---

### Media Training for Crisis

**CEO Media Training** (Q1 2026, before major press activity):

- **Hire trainer**: Media training firm ($5K-10K for 2-3 sessions)
- **Practice**: Mock interviews (friendly, hostile), crisis scenarios (data breach, lawsuit)
- **Key skills**: Bridging (redirect from tough question to key message), flagging (never say "no comment"), body language (eye contact, calm demeanor)

**Crisis Talking Points** (prepare in advance):

**Data Breach**:

- "We take data security extremely seriously. We've contained the breach and are notifying affected customers."
- "Fair Underwriting uses bank-level encryption (AES-256), annual security audits, and HIPAA-compliant infrastructure."
- "We're offering affected customers free credit monitoring and identity theft protection."

**Genetic Discrimination**:

- "Our patent-protected framework prevents insurers from accessing individual genetic results. Legally and technically impossible."
- "GINA prohibits genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment. We support extending GINA to life and disability insurance."
- "If a customer believes they experienced discrimination, we take that seriously and will investigate."

**Test Error**:

- "Our labs (Quest, LabCorp) are CLIA/CAP-certified with 99.9% accuracy. Errors are extremely rare."
- "If an error occurred, we immediately notify the customer, offer free confirmatory testing, and work with the lab to prevent recurrence."
