### /individuals (For Consumers)

#### Hero

```
Headline: "Know Your Genetic Health Risks Without Insurance Discrimination"
Subheadline: "Get tested for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) while keeping
              your results completely private from insurance companies"
```

#### What We Test

**Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) Monitoring**

- What: Circulating AAT protein levels in your blood
- Why: Low levels indicate AATD; high levels (4x) signal acute illness
- Frequency: Quarterly or annual monitoring
- Privacy: Results visible only to you

**SERPINA1 Gene Analysis**

- What: Genetic mutations causing AATD
- Why: Know if you have PiZ, PiS, or rare variants
- Frequency: One-time test (genes don't change)
- Privacy: 100% confidential genetic information
- **Important**: MZ heterozygotes (1 Z variant) face significant health risks previously underestimated

**Full DNA Sequencing (Premium)**

- What: Comprehensive genetic health risk assessment
- Why: Discover additional health risks and medication responses
- Frequency: One-time with annual discoveries update
- Privacy: You own and control all your genetic data

#### Why AATD Testing Matters

**Did you know?**

- 1 in 2,500 people have AATD
- 95% are undiagnosed
- Can cause serious lung and liver disease
- Early detection enables life-saving treatment
- Many people avoid testing due to insurance discrimination fears

**We solved that problem.**

### /science

#### What is Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD)?

**The Science**

- AAT is a protein produced by the liver
- Protects lungs from inflammation
- AATD = genetic condition causing low AAT
- Can lead to serious lung and liver disease

**The Genetics**

- Caused by mutations in SERPINA1 gene
- Common variants: PiZ, PiS
- Inherited from both parents (recessive)
- 1 in 25 people are carriers

**The Health Impacts**

- Emphysema (often mistaken for smoking-related)
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- Liver disease (cirrhosis)
- Panniculitis (skin condition)
- Vasculitis (blood vessel inflammation)

**The Treatment**

- Augmentation therapy (AAT infusions)
- Lung and liver protection strategies
- Avoiding smoking and lung irritants
- Regular monitoring
- Liver transplant (severe cases)

#### AAT Level Monitoring

**Normal Ranges**

- 100-200 mg/dL (normal)
- < 80 mg/dL (likely AATD)
- 400-800 mg/dL (acute phase response - illness)

**What We Monitor**

- Baseline AAT levels
- Trends over time
- Spikes indicating illness (4x normal)
- Response to treatment

**Clinical Value**

- Early AATD detection
- Illness early warning system
- Treatment efficacy monitoring
- Family screening indicator

#### SERPINA1 Gene Variants

**Common Variants**

- **PiMM** (normal): Two normal alleles
- **PiMS** (carrier): One normal, one S mutation - minimal clinical impact
- **PiMZ** (carrier): ⚠️ **One normal, one Z mutation - SIGNIFICANT RISK**
  - **Previously underestimated**: MZ is NOT a benign carrier state
  - **Lung Disease Risk**: 2-4x increased risk of COPD, especially in smokers
  - **Liver Disease Risk**: Elevated risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer
  - **Prevalence**: ~2-3% of population (1 in 25-40 people)
  - **Action Required**: Genetic counseling, lifestyle modifications, regular monitoring
- **PiZZ** (severe AATD): Two Z mutations - severe deficiency (~15% normal AAT)
  - Requires specialized medical care and augmentation therapy consideration
  - High risk for emphysema and liver disease
- **PiSS**: Two S mutations - mild deficiency
- **PiSZ**: One S, one Z - moderate deficiency (~40% normal AAT)
- **Rare variants**: Null, I, F, and others

**Why MZ Matters**: Recent research has shown that MZ heterozygotes face substantially higher disease risks than previously thought. Early identification enables preventive interventions that can significantly improve health outcomes.
