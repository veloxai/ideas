- Post role on job boards (LinkedIn, AngelList, Indeed, BuiltIn, Healthcare IT Jobs)
- Outbound sourcing (recruiter or hiring manager reaches out to passive candidates)
- Employee referrals (offer $2,000-5,000 referral bonus for successful hires)

**Stage 2: Screening** (Week 2-3)

- Resume review (filter for qualifications, experience, red flags)
- Phone screen (30 min, recruiter or hiring manager—culture fit, basic qualifications, compensation alignment)

**Stage 3: Interviews** (Week 3-5)

- Round 1: Hiring manager (60 min, technical or functional skills, role-specific questions)
- Round 2: Peer interview (45-60 min, team member—collaboration, technical depth)
- Round 3: Executive interview (45 min, CEO or functional leader—culture fit, mission alignment, long-term potential)
- Optional: Work sample (take-home project for engineers, PMs, marketers—paid at $200-500 for 3-5 hours work)

**Stage 4: Offer** (Week 5-6)

- Reference checks (2-3 references, back-channel if possible)
- Offer letter (salary, equity, start date, benefits summary)
- Negotiation (1-2 rounds typical, be flexible on cash vs. equity trade-offs)
- Acceptance (ideally within 1 week of offer)

**Stage 5: Onboarding** (Week 6+)

- Pre-boarding (paperwork, laptop/equipment shipped, welcome email)
- Day 1: Orientation (company mission, values, team intros, IT setup)
- Week 1: Role-specific training (product demo, codebase walkthrough, customer examples)
- Month 1: 30-day check-in (manager + new hire—feedback, questions, early wins)
- Month 3: 90-day review (performance assessment, goal-setting, culture fit)

### Interview Rubric (standardized scoring)

**Criteria** (score 1-5 for each):

1. **Technical/Functional Skills**: Can they do the job? (role-specific)
2. **Cultural Fit**: Do they align with Fair Underwriting values (mission-driven, customer-first, rigor, collaboration)?
3. **Communication**: Clear, concise, articulate?
4. **Problem-Solving**: Analytical, creative, resourceful?
5. **Growth Potential**: Can they grow into next-level role (IC → manager, manager → director)?

**Scoring**:

- 5: Exceptional (hire immediately)
- 4: Strong (hire)
- 3: Adequate (borderline—discuss with team)
- 2: Weak (likely no)
- 1: Poor (definitely no)

**Decision Rule**: Average score ≥4.0 → hire; 3.5-3.9 → discuss (may hire if specific strengths offset weaknesses); <3.5 → no hire

## Diversity, Equity, Inclusion (DEI)

### Goals

**Gender**:

- Target: 50% women by Year 3 (healthcare and genetic counseling skew female, but engineering/sales often male-dominated—need intentional hiring)

**Race/Ethnicity**:

- Target: Team reflects U.S. demographics (13% Black, 18% Hispanic, 6% Asian, 63% White)

**Geographic**:

- Target: 40% remote (outside HQ city) by Year 2 (expands talent pool, improves retention)

**Age**:

- Target: Mix of early-career (20s-30s), mid-career (30s-40s), senior (40s-60s)

### Strategies

**Sourcing**:

- Partner with diversity-focused job boards (PowerToFly, Jopwell, Mogul, Fairygodboss)
- Recruit from HBCUs, Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), women's colleges
- Attend diversity-focused career fairs (NSBE, SHPE, Grace Hopper)

**Process**:

- Blind resume review (remove names, schools to reduce bias)
- Diverse interview panels (each candidate sees ≥1 woman, ≥1 person of color on panel)
- Standardized rubric (reduces unconscious bias in scoring)

**Retention**:

- Employee Resource Groups (ERGs): Women in Tech, BIPOC @ Fair Underwriting, LGBTQ+ Allies
- Mentorship programs (senior leaders mentor underrepresented employees)
- Pay equity audits (annual review to ensure equal pay for equal work)

**Accountability**:

- DEI metrics in board deck (quarterly reporting on hiring, retention, promotion rates by gender/race)
- DEI goals tied to executive compensation (e.g., 10% of CEO bonus tied to hitting DEI targets)

---

## Retention Strategy

### Attrition Targets

**Voluntary Attrition** (employees quit):

- Year 1-2: <15%/year (early-stage startups have higher attrition—learning, role changes)
- Year 3-5: <10%/year (mature, stable team)

**Regrettable Attrition** (high performers quit):

- Target: <5%/year (low regrettable attrition is key—losing top talent is costly)

### Retention Levers

**Compensation**:

- Annual raises: 3-5% merit-based (performance), 2-3% cost-of-living
- Equity refreshes: Top performers get additional equity grants (0.05-0.2% per year) to maintain motivation
- Bonuses: Performance-based bonuses for hitting targets (10-20% of salary for IC, 20-40% for executives)

**Career Growth**:

- Promotion opportunities: Clear IC and management tracks (engineer → senior engineer → staff engineer → principal engineer OR engineer → engineering manager → director → VP)
- Lateral moves: Encourage internal mobility (e.g., CSM → PM, engineer → sales engineer)
- Learning & development: Conference attendance, training budgets, mentorship

**Culture**:

- Mission-driven: Emphasize impact (lives saved, preventable disease)
- Transparency: Monthly all-hands (CEO shares metrics, challenges, wins)
- Recognition: Shout-outs in all-hands, peer recognition program ("Genetic Hero of the Month")
- Work-life balance: No expectation of 60-hour weeks (sustainable pace)

**Manager Quality**:

- Manager training: All new managers get training (1-on-1s, feedback, performance management)
- Skip-level 1-on-1s: Executives meet with ICs (without manager present) to identify issues
- Manager feedback: 360 reviews (managers rated by direct reports, peers, managers)

**Exit Interviews**:

- Conduct exit interviews with all departing employees (understand reasons for leaving)
- Track patterns (if multiple people leave due to same issue—e.g., poor manager, unclear career path—fix it)

## Key Hiring Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Can't Hire Fast Enough (Demand > Supply)

**Symptoms**:

- Engineering team overloaded (features delayed)
- Genetic counselors overloaded (long wait times for customers)
- Sales team can't close pilots fast enough (pipeline backlog)

**Mitigation**:

- **Hire ahead of demand**: Onboard new employees 3-6 months before critical need (not just-in-time)
- **Contract/temp workers**: Use contractors for short-term capacity (engineers, genetic counselors) while recruiting full-time
- **Prioritize ruthlessly**: If can't hire fast enough, cut scope (delay nice-to-have features, focus on must-haves)
- **Increase recruiter capacity**: Hire 2-3 full-time recruiters by Year 3-4 (40+ hires/year requires dedicated recruiting)

### Risk 2: High Attrition (Lose Top Talent)

**Symptoms**:

- Key employees quit (e.g., Lead Engineer, VP Sales, top genetic counselor)
- Regrettable attrition >10%/year
- Exit interviews reveal compensation, career growth, or culture issues

**Mitigation**:

- **Competitive compensation**: Annual benchmarking (Radford, Pave) to ensure salaries/equity at market
- **Equity refreshes**: Top performers get additional grants to stay motivated
- **Career paths**: Clear promotion criteria, growth opportunities (IC and management tracks)
- **Culture investments**: Monthly all-hands, recognition programs, team retreats, manager training
- **Retention bonuses**: Critical employees (e.g., Lead Engineer during Series A raise) get retention bonuses (e.g., $20K-50K to stay through milestone)

### Risk 3: Bad Hires (Wrong Fit, Low Performance)

**Symptoms**:

- New hire underperforms (can't do the job, poor culture fit)
- Team morale suffers (other employees compensate for bad hire)
- Termination within 6-12 months (costly—recruiting, onboarding, severance)

**Mitigation**:

- **Rigorous interview process**: 3-4 rounds, work samples, reference checks (don't rush hires)
- **90-day reviews**: Formal performance review at 90 days (identify issues early, provide feedback or terminate if not working)
- **Manager training**: Train managers to identify performance issues early, give feedback, create performance improvement plans (PIPs)
- **Probationary period**: First 90 days is probationary (easier to terminate if clear misfit)

### Risk 4: Diversity Hiring Challenges

**Symptoms**:

- Team skews white, male, young (especially in engineering, sales)
- Underrepresented candidates drop out of pipeline (biased process, non-inclusive culture)

**Mitigation**:

- **Diverse sourcing**: Partner with diversity-focused job boards, recruit from HBCUs/HSIs, attend diversity career fairs
- **Blind resume review**: Remove names, schools to reduce bias
- **Diverse interview panels**: Every candidate sees ≥1 woman, ≥1 person of color
- **Inclusive culture**: ERGs, mentorship, pay equity audits, DEI goals in executive compensation
- **Accountability**: Track DEI metrics (hiring, retention, promotion rates by gender/race), report to board quarterly
