## Executive Summary

This document provides a **comprehensive playbook** for Fair Underwriting's **pilot program** (Year 1-2), the critical phase that will **prove concept, refine product, and build case studies** for scale.

**Pilot Objectives**:

1. **Prove technical feasibility**: Integration works, portal functions, testing logistics smooth
2. **Validate clinical value**: Detect MZ carriers, deliver high-quality genetic counseling, drive behavior change
3. **Demonstrate business ROI**: Show enrollment rates, customer satisfaction, cost-effectiveness
4. **Build case studies**: Document successes for marketing to future partners
5. **Iterate product**: Learn from pilot to improve for scale

**Pilot Targets (Year 1)**:

- **2-3 pilot partners** (mix of life and health insurers)
- **1,000-3,000 customers tested** (500-1,500 per partner)
- **20-75 MZ carriers detected** (assuming 2-3% prevalence)
- **10-15 families screened** (via MZ carrier referrals)
- **NPS >40** (customer satisfaction)
- **Enrollment rate 5-15%** (% of eligible customers who enroll)

## Section 1: Ideal Pilot Partner Profile

### 1.1 Partner Size & Type

**Ideal Characteristics**:

- **Mid-size insurer**: 100K-500K policyholders (large enough for meaningful data, small enough for agility)
- **Wellness-forward culture**: Existing wellness programs (gym reimbursements, health coaching, preventive screenings)
- **Innovation mindset**: Willing to pilot new technologies, not risk-averse
- **Long-term member relationships**: Life insurance, disability insurance, or group health (vs. individual health with high churn)

**Partner Types**:

1. **Life Insurance Companies** (PRIMARY TARGET):
   - **Examples**: Northwestern Mutual, MassMutual, Pacific Life, Mutual of Omaha, New York Life
   - **Rationale**:
     - Longevity-focused (early detection → longer life → more premium revenue)
     - Less regulatory complexity than health insurance
     - Members typically educated, employed, insurable (good engagement)
   - **Objections**: ROI unclear (longevity benefits take years to materialize), genetic testing stigma
   - **Mitigation**: Emphasize wellness differentiation, member engagement, strategic value

2. **Group Health Insurance** (SECONDARY TARGET):
   - **Examples**: Cambia Health, Highmark, Blue Cross Blue Shield of NC, Cigna employer groups
   - **Rationale**:
     - Medical cost savings (prevent COPD, liver disease)
     - Employer wellness benefits (reduce absenteeism, disability claims)
     - Members typically employed, stable (good engagement)
   - **Objections**: ACA restrictions (can't use genetic data for underwriting), privacy concerns
   - **Mitigation**: Emphasize wellness focus (not underwriting), privacy protections (patent framework)

3. **Disability Insurance** (TERTIARY TARGET):
   - **Examples**: Guardian, Unum, Principal Financial
   - **Rationale**: COPD is leading cause of disability claims → early detection saves money
   - **Objections**: Smaller market, less familiar with genetic testing

---

## Section 4: Pilot Enrollment Strategy

### 4.1 Enrollment Campaign Design

**Phase 1: Pre-Launch (2 weeks before)**

- **Teaser emails**: "Coming soon: Free genetic health screening"
- **Partner comms**: Announcement in partner newsletter, wellness portal homepage
- **Goal**: Build awareness, curiosity

**Phase 2: Launch (Week 1)**

- **Launch email**: Detailed invitation, education, CTA to enroll
- **Portal banner**: Prominent placement on partner wellness portal
- **Webinar** (optional): Live Q&A with genetic counselor (address concerns)
- **Goal**: Drive immediate enrollments (capture early adopters)

**Phase 3: Sustained Engagement (Weeks 2-8)**

- **Reminder emails**: Weekly or bi-weekly (to non-enrollees)
- **Success stories**: Testimonials from early testers (if available)
- **Incentives** (if needed): Raffle ($500 Amazon gift card for enrollees), charitable donation ($10 to American Lung Association per enrollment)
- **Goal**: Reach laggards, maintain momentum

**Phase 4: Last Call (Week 9-12)**

- **Final reminder**: "Last chance to enroll"
- **Extended deadline**: 2-week extension if enrollment below target
- **Goal**: Maximize enrollment before cutoff

---

### 4.2 Messaging Strategy

**Headline Message**: "Free genetic test—know your risk for lung and liver disease"

**Key Talking Points**:

1. **What**: Free genetic test for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) — a genetic condition affecting lungs and liver
2. **Why**: 1 in 25-40 people have genetic variant (MZ) that increases disease risk — most don't know
3. **How**: Simple at-home test kit or lab visit → results in 2-3 weeks → free genetic counseling if needed
4. **Privacy**: Your results are 100% private — your insurer will NOT see your genetic data (patent-protected privacy framework)
5. **Action**: If you have genetic risk, we'll help you reduce it (smoking cessation, lifestyle changes, monitoring)

**Tone**: Informative, empowering (not scary), trustworthy

**Visuals**: Clean, professional, reassuring (avoid medical jargon or intimidating imagery)

---

### 4.3 Enrollment Barriers & Mitigation

| **Barrier**                               | **Mitigation Strategy**                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **"I'm healthy, don't need this"**        | "1 in 25-40 people have this—you won't know unless you test. Early detection prevents disease."   |
| **"Genetic testing is scary"**            | "This is preventive, not diagnostic. If you have risk, we'll help you manage it."                 |
| **"My insurer will use this against me"** | "Patent-protected privacy—your insurer will NOT see your results. You own your data."             |
| **"Too busy"**                            | "Takes 5 min to enroll, 10 min to collect sample. At-home kit mailed to you."                     |
| **"Don't understand AATD"**               | "1-minute explainer video on landing page, FAQ, live chat support."                               |
| **"What if I have bad genes?"**           | "Knowledge is power. If you have risk, we'll help you reduce it (smoking cessation, monitoring)." |

| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low enrollment (<3%)**                          | Medium         | High       | Pre-launch testing (survey partner members on interest), improve messaging, add incentives                |
| **Technical integration delays**                  | Medium         | Medium     | Start integration early (Month 1), dedicated DevOps support, fallback manual process                      |
| **Legal/compliance stalls**                       | Medium         | High       | Pre-vetted legal docs (BAA, DPA, consent), proactive stakeholder engagement (meet with legal team early)  |
| **Partner champion leaves**                       | Low            | High       | Build relationships with multiple stakeholders (not just champion), exec sponsor engagement (CEO-to-CEO)  |
| **Genetic counseling capacity**                   | Low            | Medium     | Contract with multiple counseling firms (not just one), on-demand telehealth counselors                   |
| **Negative press** (genetic discrimination fears) | Low            | High       | Proactive PR (privacy protections), media training, crisis comms plan                                     |
| **Test results errors**                           | Very Low       | Very High  | Lab partner quality controls (Quest/LabCorp CLIA/CAP certified), duplicate testing for discordant results |

---

### 6.2 Contingency Plans

**If Enrollment Low (<3%)**:

- **Action 1**: A/B test messaging (fear-based vs. benefit-based)
- **Action 2**: Add incentives (raffle, gift cards)
- **Action 3**: Extend timeline (give 4 more weeks)
- **Action 4**: Partner outreach (webinars, town halls)
- **Last Resort**: Narrow eligibility (target smokers, family history of COPD—higher interest)

**If Technical Integration Fails**:

- **Fallback**: Manual process (partner emails list, customers enroll directly on Fair Underwriting site without SSO, results sent via email—not ideal but workable)

**If Partner Dissatisfied**:

- **Action 1**: Weekly check-ins (proactive communication)
- **Action 2**: Rapid iteration (fix complaints within 2 weeks)
- **Action 3**: Discount or refund (if poor experience, offer partial refund to preserve relationship)
