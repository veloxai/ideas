**Emotional State**: Motivated but overwhelmed

**Touchpoints**:

- 📧 Action reminders (1 week, 2 weeks post-counseling)
- 📱 SMS appointment reminders
- 🌐 Portal: Action checklist (track completion)

**Pain Points**:

- PCP visit delay (can't get appointment for 4-6 weeks)
- Insurance questions (will PFTs/LFTs be covered? yes, preventive)
- Smoking cessation difficult (nicotine addiction, stress trigger)
- Family notification awkward (don't want to worry them)

**Optimization**:

- ✅ **PCP letter template**: Professional, clear recommendations (helps doctor understand)
- ✅ **Insurance FAQ**: "PFTs and LFTs are covered as preventive care (not genetic testing)"
- ✅ **Smoking cessation support**: Weekly check-ins, motivational content
- ✅ **Family screening script**: Suggested talking points for conversation

### Stage 4: Lifestyle Modifications (Months 1-6)

**What Happens**: Customer implements changes

**Key Actions**:

1. **Smoking Cessation Progress** (if smoker):
   - Weeks 1-2: Preparing to quit (setting date, gathering support)
   - Week 3: Quit date
   - Weeks 4-12: Early abstinence (hardest period, need support)
   - Months 3-6: Maintenance (prevent relapse)
2. **Occupational Protection**:
   - Evaluate workplace exposures (dust, fumes, chemicals)
   - Use respiratory protection (masks) if needed
   - Consider job change if high-risk environment
3. **Alcohol Reduction**: Minimize drinking (liver disease risk)
4. **Weight Management**: Maintain healthy weight (reduces metabolic stress on liver)
5. **Vaccinations**: Get flu shot, pneumococcal vaccine (prevent respiratory infections)

**Emotional State**: Determined but challenged

**Touchpoints**:

- 📧 Monthly check-in emails ("How are you doing?")
- 🌐 Portal: Progress tracking (smoke-free days, weight log)
- 📞 Follow-up counseling (optional, 3-month check-in)

**Pain Points**:

- Smoking relapse (70% of quit attempts fail initially)
- Lack of ongoing support (feel alone in journey)
- Motivation wanes (initial urgency fades)
- Lifestyle changes hard (habits deeply ingrained)

**Optimization**:

- ✅ **Smoking cessation coaching**: Partner with digital therapeutics (Quit Genius, Pivot, etc.)
- ✅ **Peer support**: Connect MZ carriers with each other (support group, online community)
- ✅ **Gamification**: Smoke-free streaks, badges, rewards
- ✅ **Relapse support**: "Relapse is normal—here's how to get back on track"

### Stage 5: Monitoring & Long-Term Management (Ongoing)

**What Happens**: Annual monitoring, ongoing lifestyle maintenance

**Key Actions**:

1. **Annual Spirometry** (PFT): Monitor lung function
2. **Annual Liver Function Tests** (LFTs): Monitor liver health
3. **Annual AAT Level**: Track AAT protein levels
4. **Annual Check-In**: With genetic counselor or PCP

**Emotional State**: Routine, confident

**Touchpoints**:

- 📧 Annual testing reminders
- 🌐 Portal: Track trends over time (PFT results, LFTs, AAT levels)
- 📞 Annual counseling check-in (optional)

**Pain Points**:

- Testing fatigue (another blood draw?)
- Results anxiety (what if PFT is declining?)
- Lack of urgency (feel fine, skip annual tests)

**Optimization**:

- ✅ **Automated reminders**: "It's time for your annual AAT monitoring"
- ✅ **Trend visualization**: Show PFT, LFT, AAT trends over years (visual feedback)
- ✅ **Celebration**: "You've maintained healthy lung function for 3 years—congrats!"
- ✅ **Early intervention**: If PFT declining, proactive outreach by counselor
