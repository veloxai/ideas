## 📊 Unit Economics

### Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)

**Website Visitor → Email Subscriber**:

- Marketing spend: $10,000/year (Year 3)
- New subscribers: 2,000
- CPA: $5 per subscriber

**Email Subscriber → Donor**:

- Conversion rate: 30%
- CPA: $5 ÷ 0.30 = $16.67 per donor

**Donor Lifetime Value (LTV)**:

- Average one-time gift: $75
- Average donor retention: 3 years
- LTV: $75 × 3 = $225

**LTV:CPA Ratio**: $225 ÷ $16.67 = **13.5:1** (Excellent; >3:1 is healthy)

---

### Cost Per Patient Served

**Total patients engaged annually (Year 3)**:

- Website visitors: 50,000
- Forum members: 2,500
- Newsletter subscribers: 5,000
- Event participants: 300
- Support group members: 500

**Total operating costs (Year 3)**: $169,960

**Cost per patient served**: $169,960 ÷ 50,000 = **$3.40 per patient**

**Cost per deeply engaged patient** (forum/support group): $169,960 ÷ 3,000 = **$56.65 per patient**

---

### Risk Mitigation

**Risk**: Dependence on pharmaceutical company sponsorships
**Mitigation**: Diversify corporate sponsors (testing companies, equipment manufacturers, insurers); limit any single sponsor to <15% of revenue

**Risk**: HIPAA violations in forums
**Mitigation**: Clear community guidelines; HIPAA-compliant hosting; anonymous posting options; volunteer moderator training

**Risk**: Medical misinformation spreading in community
**Mitigation**: Medical advisory board reviews content; moderators trained to identify misinformation; "This is not medical advice" disclaimers; links to reputable sources

**Risk**: Donor fatigue
**Mitigation**: Excellent stewardship; impact storytelling; diverse engagement opportunities (events, peer-to-peer, advocacy); transparent financial reporting

**Risk**: Competition from Alpha-1 Foundation
**Mitigation**: Complementary positioning (patients vs. research); partnership opportunities (content sharing, cross-promotion); focus on community/support vs. science
