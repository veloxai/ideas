## 1. Introduction

### Alpha-1 is a Global Disease

**United States**:

- 250,000 affected individuals (PiZZ, PiSZ, rare variants)
- 30,000 diagnosed (12%)
- Alpha1Life.com launched (Years 1-5, this white paper)

**But Alpha-1 doesn't stop at borders.**

**Global Prevalence**:

- **Europe**: 150,000 affected (highest in Northern Europe - Sweden, Denmark, UK, Ireland)
- **Latin America**: 50,000 affected (significant populations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile)
- **Middle East**: 30,000 affected (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt)
- **Asia**: 20,000 affected (rare, but present in India, China, Southeast Asia)
- **Africa**: 10,000 affected (North Africa, some sub-Saharan populations)
- **Australia/NZ**: 5,000 affected

**Total Global Burden**: ~500,000 affected individuals worldwide (only 100,000 diagnosed globally, 20%).

---

### Why Go Global?

**1. Moral Imperative**:

- Alpha-1 patients in developing countries have worse outcomes (no augmentation therapy, no specialized care)
- Digital health can reach underserved populations

**2. Scientific Advantage**:

- Genetic diversity (different populations, different modifiers)
- Larger research cohort (500,000 global vs. 250,000 US)
- Faster clinical trial recruitment (global trials enroll 3x faster)

**3. Economic Opportunity**:

- Global pharma partnerships (Grifols, CSL Behring, Takeda operate globally)
- International funding (EU Horizon grants, WHO programs)
- Expand Foundation's impact (from US-focused to global leader)

**4. Accelerate the Cure**:

- More patients = more data = faster discoveries
- Global collaboration = shared knowledge, avoid duplication
- Gene therapy benefits everyone (no borders for cure)

---

### Two Strategic Pillars

**1. Global Alpha-1 Network** ($10M-$15M, Years 6-10)

- Internationalize Alpha1Life.com (translate to 10+ languages)
- Partner with international Alpha-1 organizations (Europe, Latin America, Asia)
- Build global patient registry (100,000+ patients worldwide)
- Host international conferences, webinars, support groups
- Advocacy: Universal newborn screening globally

**2. Cure Initiative** ($100M-$150M, Years 6-15)

- Fund gene therapy research (ARO-AAT, Intellia, Vertex, new entrants)
- Accelerate clinical trials (global sites, faster enrollment)
- Develop curative therapies (gene therapy, gene editing, liver-directed therapies)
- Goal: FDA-approved gene therapy by 2030, cure Alpha-1 by 2035

---

### Component 2: Global Patient Registry

**Expand from 25,000 US patients to 100,000 global patients** (Years 6-10)

**Why Global Registry?**

**1. Scientific Power**:

- Genetic diversity (different populations, different modifiers)
- Environmental diversity (air pollution in Beijing vs. clean air in Norway - how does it affect Alpha-1?)
- Treatment diversity (augmentation therapy access varies - natural experiment)

**2. Clinical Trial Recruitment**:

- Global trials enroll faster (more patients, more sites)
- Regulatory agencies prefer global data (FDA + EMA = worldwide approval)

**3. Advocacy**:

- Unified voice (100,000 patients globally = political power)
- Share best practices (UK's NHS covers augmentation therapy, US doesn't - why?)

**Data Harmonization**:

- Challenge: Different countries collect different data (US uses FEV1 in liters, Europe uses % predicted)
- Solution: Standardize data dictionary (HL7 FHIR standards, CDISC for clinical trials)
- Centralized database (hosted on AWS, EU data in Frankfurt servers for GDPR compliance)

**Partnerships**:

- Alpha-1 Foundation International Registry (3,000 patients, US-based)
- Swedish Alpha-1 Registry (Malmö, 1,500 patients)
- European Alpha-1 Research Collaboration (E-ARC, 5,000 patients)
- **Strategy**: Merge data (with IRB approval, data use agreements)

**Success Metrics** (Years 6-10):

- 100,000 patients registered globally
- 50+ countries represented
- 200+ publications using global registry data

---

### Component 3: Global Research Collaborations

**World Alpha-1 Research Consortium** (Year 7 launch)

---

### Component 4: Global Advocacy

**Universal Newborn Screening Campaign** (Years 6-15)

**Current Status**:

- **US**: 3 states screen all newborns (not on federal RUSP)
- **Europe**: Sporadic (Sweden screens high-risk, most countries don't)
- **Rest of World**: Rare (only pilot programs)

**Goal**: Add Alpha-1 to newborn screening panels worldwide (50+ countries by 2035)

**Strategy**:

**Phase 1: Demonstrate Cost-Effectiveness** (Years 6-8)

- Pilot programs in 5 countries (US, UK, Sweden, Australia, Brazil)
- Collect data: # diagnosed, age at diagnosis, outcomes (with vs. without screening)
- Economic analysis: Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)
- Target: <$50K per QALY (threshold for cost-effectiveness)
- Publish results in health economics journals

**Phase 2: Regulatory Approval** (Years 8-12)

- Submit to national committees:
  - US: Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA, adds to RUSP)
  - EU: European Society for Human Genetics (ESHG)
  - WHO: Add to WHO essential diagnostics list
- Present evidence: Clinical utility, cost-effectiveness, feasibility
- Patient advocacy: Testify at hearings, share stories

**Phase 3: Implementation** (Years 12-15)

- Countries adopt screening (requires lab infrastructure, clinician training)
- Foundation provides support: Training materials, genetic counseling resources
- Monitor: # countries adopted, # babies screened, # diagnosed

**Success Metrics**:

## 3. The Cure Initiative

### Vision Statement

**"We will cure Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency by 2035."**

**Not manage. Not treat. Cure.**

---

### What Does "Cure" Mean?

**For Alpha-1, a cure means**:

1. **Restore Normal AAT Levels**: Permanent, not weekly infusions
2. **Stop Disease Progression**: No more lung/liver damage
3. **One-Time Treatment**: Gene therapy or gene editing (not lifelong medication)
4. **Reverse Existing Damage** (aspirational): Regenerate lung tissue, reverse cirrhosis

---

### Current State of Gene Therapy (2025)

**Three Gene Therapy Approaches**:

**1. AAV Gene Therapy** (Adeno-Associated Virus)

- Deliver corrected AAT gene to liver (liver produces AAT)
- **Companies**: Grifols/Vivet Therapeutics (AAV-AAT)
- **Status**: Phase 1/2 trials ongoing
- **Pros**: Proven technology (AAV used for hemophilia, spinal muscular atrophy)
- **Cons**: Immune response to AAV (limits re-dosing), durability unclear (gene expression may wane)

**2. mRNA Gene Therapy**

- Inject mRNA encoding correct AAT (liver produces AAT from mRNA template)
- **Companies**: Moderna (early preclinical)
- **Status**: Preclinical (animal studies)
- **Pros**: No immune response to virus, can re-dose
- **Cons**: Short-lived expression (need frequent dosing, not one-time cure?)

**3. Gene Editing (CRISPR)**

- Edit patient's DNA (fix PiZ mutation in liver cells)
- **Companies**:
  - Intellia Therapeutics (CRISPR base editing)
  - Vertex Pharmaceuticals (partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics)
  - Beam Therapeutics (base editing)
- **Status**: Preclinical → Phase 1 trials (2026-2027)
- **Pros**: Permanent fix (DNA edited forever), no need for re-dosing
- **Cons**: Off-target editing (unintended mutations?), delivery challenge (edit enough liver cells?)

**4. RNA Interference (RNAi) - Not a Cure, But Helpful**

- Silence mutant AAT gene (reduce toxic PiZ protein accumulation in liver)
- **Companies**: Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals (ARO-AAT)
- **Status**: Phase 2 trials (2024-2026)
- **Pros**: Reduces liver disease risk
- **Cons**: Doesn't increase AAT levels (still need augmentation therapy for lungs), not a cure

---

### The Cure Initiative Strategy

**Goal**: Accelerate gene therapy development, get to FDA approval by 2030, make accessible to all patients by 2035.

---

### Component 1: Cure Research Fund

**$50M-$75M Research Fund** (Years 6-15)

**Purpose**: Fund high-risk, high-reward gene therapy research (beyond what pharma/NIH fund)

**Funding Priorities**:

**1. Gene Editing Optimization** ($10M-$15M)

- Improve CRISPR delivery (lipid nanoparticles, AAV hybrids)
- Reduce off-target editing (high-fidelity CRISPR enzymes)
- In vivo editing (edit liver cells in living patients, not ex vivo)

**2. Durability Studies** ($5M-$10M)

- How long does AAV gene therapy last? (10 years? 20 years? Lifetime?)
- Longitudinal studies (follow patients 10+ years post-therapy)

**3. Combination Therapies** ($5M-$10M)

- Gene therapy + RNAi (increase good AAT, decrease bad AAT)
- Gene therapy + anti-inflammatory (protect lungs while AAT levels normalize)

**4. Lung Regeneration** ($10M-$15M, aspirational)

- Can we reverse emphysema? (stem cells, regenerative medicine)
- Animal studies (mice, non-human primates)
- If successful, human trials (Year 10+)

**5. Pediatric Gene Therapy** ($5M-$10M)

- Treat children before lung/liver damage (prevent disease, not just stop progression)
- Safety studies (gene therapy in growing children)

**6. Global Access** ($15M-$20M)

- Manufacturing (reduce gene therapy cost from $1M to $100K)
- Biosimilar gene therapies (generic versions, post-patent)
- Distribution (cold chain, trained clinicians in developing countries)

**Funding Mechanism**:

- RFPs (Request for Proposals): Annual cycle, competitive grants
- Review: Scientific advisory board (10 experts: researchers, clinicians, patients)
- Awards: $500K-$5M per project, 2-5 year duration
- IP: Foundation owns IP (license to companies, royalties fund future research)

---

### Component 2: Clinical Trial Acceleration

**Problem**: Clinical trials slow (10-15 years drug development to FDA approval)

**Solution**: Foundation-sponsored trials (faster, patient-centric)

**Foundation-Sponsored Phase 2 Trial** (Years 7-10, $20M-$30M)

**Rationale**: Phase 1 trials (safety) done by companies, but Phase 2 (efficacy) often stalls (pharma waits for Phase 1 results, funding gaps, etc.)

**Trial Design**:

- **Intervention**: Most promising gene therapy (e.g., Intellia CRISPR, Vertex AAV)
- **Population**: 100 patients (PiZZ, FEV1 30-80%, ages 18-65)
- **Endpoints**:
  - Primary: AAT levels at 6 months (>11 µM = normal)
  - Secondary: FEV1 decline rate (slower than control), exacerbations, quality of life
- **Duration**: 2-year treatment + 5-year follow-up (monitor durability)
- **Sites**: 20 sites globally (US, Europe, Latin America)
- **Cost**: $200K-$300K per patient = $20M-$30M total

**Partnership**:

- Co-sponsor with pharma company (Foundation contributes $10M, pharma $10M)
- Foundation recruits patients (via Alpha1Life.com registry)
- Foundation handles logistics (patient navigation, travel assistance)
- Pharma provides drug, conducts trial

**Success Criteria**:

- AAT levels normalized (>11 µM) in 70%+ patients
- FEV1 decline reduced by 50% (vs. historical controls)
- No serious adverse events
- Data supports Phase 3 trial (pivotal trial for FDA approval)

---

### Component 3: FDA Fast Track & Expanded Access

**Work with FDA to Accelerate Approval**

**1. Breakthrough Therapy Designation**

- Gene therapy qualifies (serious disease, preliminary evidence of benefit)
- Benefits: Faster review, more FDA guidance, priority review

**2. Accelerated Approval Pathway**

- Use surrogate endpoint (AAT levels) instead of clinical endpoint (FEV1 decline over 5 years)
- Conditional approval (approve based on AAT levels, confirm FEV1 benefit post-approval)

**3. Expanded Access (Compassionate Use)**

- For patients who can't wait (FEV1 <20%, transplant-eligible)
- Pre-approval access to gene therapy
- Foundation navigates paperwork (help patients, clinicians apply)

**Foundation Role**:

- Hire regulatory expert (ex-FDA, $200K/year)
- Submit FDA comments (on behalf of patients)
- Organize patient testimonials (FDA meetings)
- Draft guidance documents (real-world evidence, patient-reported outcomes)

---

### Component 4: Global Gene Therapy Access Program

**Problem**: Gene therapy costs $500K-$2M per patient (unaffordable)

**Solution**: Foundation-negotiated access, subsidies, global manufacturing

**Access Strategies**:

**1. Negotiate with Manufacturers** (Years 10-15)

- Volume discounts (if Foundation commits to 10,000 patients, lower per-patient cost)
- Tiered pricing (high-income countries pay $1M, low-income countries pay $50K)

**2. Insurance Advocacy** (Years 10-15)

- Mandate coverage (gene therapy = standard of care, must cover)
- Medicare coverage (age 65+, Medicare pays for gene therapy)
- Medicaid coverage (low-income, states cover)

**3. Patient Assistance Fund** ($20M-$40M, Years 10-15)

- Co-pay assistance ($10K-$50K per patient, to fill gaps)
- Full coverage (for uninsured patients, Foundation pays full cost for 100-200 patients/year)

**4. Global Manufacturing Partnerships** (Years 12-15)

- Partner with biosimilar manufacturers (e.g., India, China)
- Produce lower-cost gene therapy ($100K-$200K vs. $1M)
- Distribute globally (Latin America, Africa, Asia)

**Success Metrics**:

- Year 10: 1,000 patients treated with gene therapy (early adopters, US/Europe)
- Year 15: 10,000 patients treated (global access)
- Year 20: 50,000 patients treated (half of diagnosed population)

---

### Component 5: Cure Celebration & Post-Cure Support

**When Gene Therapy is FDA-Approved** (Target: 2030)

**Celebration**:

- Press conference (Foundation + pharma company announce cure)
- "Cure Day" (annual holiday for Alpha-1 community)
- Documentary (story of cure, from Mark Egly's vision to FDA approval)

**Post-Cure Support**:

- Patient navigation (help patients access gene therapy)
- Genetic counseling (who should get gene therapy? PiZZ yes, PiMZ maybe?)
- Long-term monitoring (registry tracks gene therapy outcomes, safety)
- Advocacy (ensure insurance coverage, global access)

**Foundation's New Mission** (post-2035):

- From "find a cure" to "ensure all patients get the cure"
- Expand to other rare diseases (apply Alpha1Life.com model to cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, etc.)
