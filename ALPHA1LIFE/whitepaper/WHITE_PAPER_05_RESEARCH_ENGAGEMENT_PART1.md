## 2. Patient Registry

### Problem Statement

**Research is slow because patient data is fragmented**:

- Alpha-1 Foundation registry: 10,000 patients (excellent, but need more)
- Pharma registries: Biased (only patients on their drug)
- Academic registries: Small (single-center, 100-500 patients)
- EHR data: Siloed (can't analyze across health systems)

**Comprehensive registry solves this**: 25,000+ patients, longitudinal data, fuels research.

---

### Registry Design

**Inclusion Criteria**:

- Confirmed Alpha-1 diagnosis (genetic testing: PiZZ, PiSZ, PiMZ, rare variants)
- OR carrier status (PiMZ, PiMS)
- OR family member of Alpha-1 patient (unaffected)
- Age: All ages (infants to elderly)
- Geography: Global (US, Europe, Asia, Africa, etc.)

**Exclusion Criteria**: None (all Alpha-1 patients welcome)

---

## 3. Research & Trial Matching

### Overview

Similar to Clinical Trial Matching (Chapter 4), but broader:

- **Clinical trials**: Drug trials, gene therapy trials
- **Observational studies**: Longitudinal studies, quality of life studies
- **Surveys**: Quick 5-10 minute surveys ($10-$25 compensation)
- **Focus groups**: Virtual focus groups (product feedback, research priorities)

---

### Research Types

**1. Interventional Clinical Trials** (drug/device testing):

- Gene therapy trials (ARO-AAT, NTLA-2002, VX-864)
- Augmentation therapy trials (new formulations, dosing)
- Lung regeneration trials (stem cells, tissue engineering)
- Time commitment: High (weekly/monthly visits, 1-5 years)
- Compensation: $500-$5,000 (travel reimbursement, time compensation)

**2. Observational Studies** (no drug, just observation):

- Natural history studies (track disease progression)
- Biomarker studies (identify predictors of decline)
- Quality of life studies (SGRQ, CAT, SF-36)
- Time commitment: Medium (1-2 visits/year)
- Compensation: $50-$200/visit

**3. Survey Studies** (online, short):

- Treatment satisfaction surveys
- Symptom burden surveys
- Healthcare access surveys
- Time commitment: Low (5-30 minutes, one-time)
- Compensation: $10-$50

**4. Focus Groups** (qualitative research):

- Product feedback (mobile app features, website design)
- Research priorities (what questions do patients want answered?)
- Treatment preferences (daily infusion vs. weekly, home vs. clinic)
- Time commitment: Low-Medium (1-2 hours, one-time)
- Compensation: $100-$200

**5. Genetic Studies** (DNA/RNA analysis):

- Whole genome sequencing (identify genetic modifiers)
- Transcriptomics (gene expression patterns)
- Epigenetics (environmental effects on genes)
- Time commitment: Low (one blood draw)
- Compensation: $50-$100 + free genetic data

---

### Matching Algorithm

**Patient Profile** (auto-populated from registry):

- Demographics, genotype, disease severity, treatment history
- Location, willingness to travel
- Research preferences (interventional vs. observational, time commitment)

**Study Database**:

- Sync with ClinicalTrials.gov (daily)
- Manually add non-interventional studies (surveys, focus groups)
- 100-200 active studies at any given time

**Matching**:

- Compare patient profile to study eligibility criteria
- Generate match score (0-100%)
- Rank studies by match score
- Patient dashboard: "You may be eligible for 5 research studies"

---

### Success Metrics

**Participation**:

- Baseline: 5-10% of eligible patients participate in research
- Goal: 30% participation (3-6x increase)
- Year 2-5: 3,000 patients matched, 1,000 enrolled (33% conversion)

**Research Acceleration**:

- Trial enrollment time: 18 months → 6 months (3x faster)
- Study completion time: 5 years → 3 years (faster enrollment + better retention)

---

### Cost

**Year 2**: $50K (algorithm development, study database)
**Year 3-5**: $20K/year (maintenance)

## 4. Patient-Driven Research Platform

### Concept

**Traditional research**: Researchers decide questions, design studies, analyze data, publish
**Patient-driven research**: Patients propose questions, co-design studies, co-analyze data, co-author papers

**Why this matters**:

- Patients know what questions matter most (researchers focus on what's fundable)
- Patient engagement improves recruitment, retention
- Results more actionable (patients design practical interventions)

---

### How It Works

**Step 1: Idea Submission**

- Any patient can submit research question
- Form: "What question do you want answered?"
- Example questions:
  - "Does daily home FEV1 monitoring reduce exacerbations?"
  - "What percentage of Alpha-1 patients have anxiety/depression?"
  - "Does augmentation therapy improve quality of life (not just FEV1)?"
  - "Which Alpha-1 patients respond best to augmentation therapy?"

**Step 2: Community Voting**

- All submitted ideas posted to forum
- Patients upvote (like Reddit)
- Top 10 ideas per quarter advance to next stage

**Step 3: Feasibility Review**

- Scientific Advisory Board reviews top 10 ideas
- Assess: Is this answerable? Ethical? Affordable? Impactful?
- Select 3-5 ideas per quarter to move forward

**Step 4: Patient-Researcher Partnering**

- Pair patient (idea originator) with academic researcher
- Co-design study (protocol, surveys, outcomes)
- IRB submission (patient listed as co-investigator!)

**Step 5: Funding**

- Foundation funds $10K-$50K per study (pilot studies)
- Or help write grant (NIH, PCORI - prefer patient-driven research)

**Step 6: Conduct Study**

- Recruit via Alpha1Life.com registry
- Patient co-investigator involved in all decisions
- Monthly update emails to community

**Step 7: Publication**

- Patient co-author on paper
- Plain-language summary posted to Alpha1Life.com
- Webinar: "What We Learned from [Study Name]"

---

### Example Studies

**Study 1: "Does Daily Home Spirometry Improve Outcomes?"**

- **Patient idea**: Sarah (PiZZ, on augmentation therapy) notices FEV1 varies day-to-day
- **Research question**: If patients measure FEV1 daily (Bluetooth spirometer), can we detect exacerbations earlier?
- **Study design**: 100 patients, Bluetooth spirometer, track FEV1 daily for 1 year
- **Primary outcome**: Time to exacerbation detection (daily spirometry vs. clinic visits every 3 months)
- **Results**: Daily spirometry detects decline 14 days earlier (allows early intervention)
- **Publication**: Sarah co-author, presented at ATS conference

**Study 2: "Mental Health in Alpha-1 Patients"**

- **Patient idea**: Michael (PiZZ, post-transplant) notices many patients struggle with depression
- **Research question**: What percentage of Alpha-1 patients have anxiety, depression, PTSD?
- **Study design**: 1,000 patients, validated mental health surveys (PHQ-9, GAD-7, PCL-5)
- **Results**: 45% have depression, 38% anxiety, 20% PTSD (higher than general population)
- **Impact**: Foundation launches mental health support program (telehealth counseling)

**Study 3: "Augmentation Therapy Responders vs. Non-Responders"**

- **Patient idea**: James (PiZZ, on augmentation 5 years) wonders why some patients stabilize, others decline
- **Research question**: Can we predict who will respond to augmentation therapy?
- **Study design**: 500 patients, whole genome sequencing, track FEV1 decline for 3 years
- **Results**: Genetic modifier identified (gene variant on chromosome 14 predicts response)
- **Impact**: Precision medicine (test for modifier before starting augmentation therapy)
