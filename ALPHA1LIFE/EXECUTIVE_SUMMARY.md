# Alpha1Life.com - Executive Summary

**Date**: November 11, 2025
**Project Owner**: Mark Egly Foundation for Alpha-1 Awareness
**Status**: Planning Complete → Ready for Implementation

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Alpha1Life.com** is a comprehensive patient-facing website that will serve as the digital home for people affected by Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD). The platform combines patient education, community support, and fundraising to fulfill the Mark Egly Foundation's mission of supporting Alpha-1 patients and families.

---

## 💡 The Opportunity

**Current State**: old.alpha1life.com is a minimal single-page site with just a tagline and donation button.

**Vision**: Transform into a comprehensive patient resource that rivals MichaelJFox.org and Alpha1.org, becoming the premier patient-facing AATD community hub.

**Gap We Fill**:

- Existing sites (Alpha1.org) are clinical and research-focused
- Newly diagnosed patients need simple, compassionate guidance
- Families need community connection and peer support
- Patients want to share stories and help others
