## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Brand Identity

**Voice & Tone**:

- **Warm**: Approachable, caring, compassionate
- **Clear**: Jargon-free, plain language, accessible
- **Hopeful**: Emphasize living well, not just surviving
- **Empowering**: "You can manage this" vs. "This is scary"
- **Community-focused**: "We're in this together"

**Visual Identity**:

- **Colors**:
  - Primary: Teal/Turquoise (calm, trust, medical, rare disease ribbon color)
  - Secondary: Warm orange (hope, energy)
  - Accent: Soft yellow (optimism)
  - Neutrals: Warm grays, whites
- **Typography**:
  - Headings: Bold, clear, sans-serif (Open Sans or similar)
  - Body: Readable, accessible (16px minimum, 1.6 line height)
- **Imagery**:
  - Real patients (with permission)
  - Diverse representation
  - Positive, active lifestyle images
  - Avoid overly clinical/sterile medical imagery
  - Use photos that show hope, connection, resilience

**Design Principles**:

1. **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
2. **Mobile-First**: 60%+ traffic will be mobile
3. **Speed**: Fast load times (under 3 seconds)
4. **Readability**: High contrast, large text, clear hierarchy
5. **Scannable**: Headings, bullet points, short paragraphs
6. **Visual Hierarchy**: Important info stands out

│                                            │
│  Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD)   │
│  is a genetic condition that can affect   │
│  your lungs and liver. You're born with   │
│  it, and it runs in families.             │
│                                            │
│  THE SIMPLE VERSION:                       │
│                                            │
│  Your body makes a protein called alpha-1 │
│  antitrypsin (AAT). This protein protects │
│  your lungs. When you have AATD, your     │
│  body doesn't make enough AAT, so your    │
│  lungs can be more easily damaged.        │
│                                            │
