### The Solution

**Alpha1Life.com**: Digital platform → Clinical integration → Research infrastructure → Cure

### The Impact

- **285,000 QALYs gained** (quality-adjusted life years)
- **5,000+ lives saved** (early diagnosis, gene therapy)
- **$44.75 billion healthcare savings** (avoid transplants, hospitalizations)
- **338:1 economic ROI** ($44.75B ÷ $132.5M)
- **Alpha-1 eliminated by 2050** (universal screening + cure)

### The Legacy
