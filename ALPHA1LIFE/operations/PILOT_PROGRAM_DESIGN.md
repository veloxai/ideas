## 🚨 Risk Management

### Risk 1: Low Beta Tester Signup (<50)

**Mitigation**:

- Start recruitment 4 weeks before launch (not 2)
- Offer incentives (exclusive founding member status)
- Personal outreach to support group leaders
- Extend recruitment period if needed

**Contingency**:

- If <50, proceed with smaller group (30-40 is still valuable)
- Supplement with internal MEF staff/board testing

---

### Risk 2: Low Engagement (Activation <50%)

**Mitigation**:

- Engaging orientation sessions (not just "go test it")
- Daily prompts and check-ins (keep beta testers engaged)
- Gamification (most active tester gets recognition)

**Contingency**:

- Extend beta period (3 weeks instead of 2)
- Re-engage inactive testers (personal phone call or email)
- Focus on engaged subset for deeper feedback

---

### Risk 3: Critical Bugs Discovered Late

**Mitigation**:

- Extensive pre-beta QA testing
- Test on multiple devices, browsers, screen sizes
- Have developer on-call during beta week 1

**Contingency**:

- If critical bug found Week 2, delay public launch by 2-4 weeks
- Communicate transparently with beta testers
- Use time to fix + re-test thoroughly

---

### Risk 4: Negative Feedback or Concerns

**Mitigation**:

- Set expectations: "Beta means imperfect, we want honest feedback"
- Respond quickly to all concerns (acknowledge, explain, fix)
- Over-communicate: weekly update emails to beta testers

**Contingency**:

- If major concerns (privacy, safety, misinformation), address immediately
- Pause beta if needed to fix fundamental issues
- Re-launch beta after fixes (with same testers)

---

### Risk 5: Beta Testers Share Publicly (Pre-Launch Leak)

**Mitigation**:

- Ask beta testers to keep feedback within group (not NDA, just request)
- Emphasize exclusivity ("you get first look")
- Monitor social media for leaks

**Contingency**:

- If leaked, embrace it (share preview publicly)
- Accelerate public launch timeline if buzz is positive
