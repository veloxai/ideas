✅ **DO**:

- Be kind and supportive
- Respect others' experiences (everyone's AATD journey is different)

- Post personal health info about others (HIPAA violation)
- Spam, advertise, or promote products
- Bully, harass, or attack others
- Share copyrighted content without permission

**Violations**: First offense = warning. Repeated violations = temporary or permanent ban.

Full guidelines: [Link to Community Guidelines]

---

### Q: Can I post anonymously?

**A**: You post under your username (which can be anonymous like "JohnD123"), not your real name. So yes, it's semi-anonymous.

However, everything you post is public and searchable. If you share specific details about your life, someone might be able to identify you.

**For truly private conversations**: Use Direct Messages (DMs) to specific members or email staff.

---

### Q: Someone posted something offensive. What do I do?

**A**:

1. **Flag the post**: Click the "Flag" button on the post
2. **Explain why**: "This violates community guidelines because..."
3. **Moderators review**: Within 1-2 hours, a moderator will review and take action

**Don't**: Engage with trolls or argue publicly. Let moderators handle it.

---

### Q: How do I find others with similar experiences?

**A**:

- **Forum Search**: Use search bar to find posts about specific topics (e.g., "augmentation therapy")
- **Forum Categories**: Browse categories like "Newly Diagnosed" or "ZZ Genotype"
- **Introduce Yourself**: Post in "Introductions" forum—others will respond
- **Virtual Support Groups**: Monthly Zoom meetings (connect in real-time)

---

### Q: What if I post something I regret?

**A**: You can edit or delete your own posts within 24 hours of posting. After that, contact a moderator or email support@alpha1life.com to request deletion.

## 4️⃣ Medical/Clinical Questions

### Q: Can I ask medical questions in the forum?

**A**: You can ask questions about others' experiences, but remember:

- **We are NOT doctors**: No one here can provide medical advice
- **Peer support only**: We share personal experiences, not clinical guidance
- **Always consult your doctor**: For medical decisions, talk to your healthcare provider

**Good forum questions**:

- "Has anyone experienced side effects from augmentation therapy?"
- "What questions should I ask my doctor about starting treatment?"
- "How do you manage shortness of breath day-to-day?"

**Questions for your doctor** (not the forum):

- "Should I start augmentation therapy?"
- "Is this symptom related to my AATD?"
- "Can I stop taking this medication?"
