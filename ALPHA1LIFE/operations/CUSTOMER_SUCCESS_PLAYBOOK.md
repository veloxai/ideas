## 🆘 Crisis Response Protocols

### Scenario 1: Newly Diagnosed Patient in Crisis (Fear, Panic)

**Forum Post Example**:

> "I was just diagnosed with AATD yesterday. The doctor said my lungs are already damaged. I'm terrified. I have two young kids. Am I going to die? Please help."

**Response Protocol** (Community Manager or Moderator, <30 minutes)

```
Hi [Username],

I'm so sorry you're going through this. I can only imagine how scared you must be right now. Please know that you are NOT alone, and we are here for you.

First, take a deep breath. Alpha-1 is a serious condition, but many people with AATD live long, full lives with proper treatment and care. You found us, which means you're already taking steps to learn and connect—that's huge.

Here's what I want you to know:

1. Early diagnosis is GOOD. You now know what you're dealing with and can start treatment early, which makes a big difference.

2. Treatment works. Augmentation therapy (if you're a candidate) can slow disease progression. Many people on treatment live active, fulfilling lives.

3. You're not alone. There are 2,000+ people in this community who understand exactly what you're feeling right now. Many of them felt the same fear when they were first diagnosed—and they're thriving today.

I'm going to tag a few community members who have been where you are:
- @[Username1]: Diagnosed 5 years ago, two kids, doing well
- @[Username2]: Newly diagnosed 6 months ago, can relate to the fear
- @[Username3]: Long-time patient, great perspective on living well with AATD

In the meantime:
- Read this: [Link to "Newly Diagnosed: What to Expect"] (written in plain language, not scary medical jargon)
- Watch this: [Link to patient story video from someone thriving with AATD]
- Call this: [Alpha-1 Foundation helpline] for immediate support (they have trained counselors)

If you need to talk to someone on the phone RIGHT NOW, reply to this post with your email, and I'll reach out within the hour. Or email me directly: [Community Manager Email].

You're going to be okay. We've got you.

[Community Manager Name]
```

**Follow-Up Protocol**:

- Check back on post within 4 hours
- If no response from user, send private message
- If still no response after 24 hours, email user
- Escalate to ED if user expresses suicidal ideation (provide crisis hotline)

---

### Scenario 2: Patient Experiencing Treatment Side Effects

**Forum Post Example**:

> "I just started augmentation therapy and I feel TERRIBLE. Fever, headache, nausea. Is this normal? Should I stop?"

**Response Protocol** (<1 hour)

```
Hi [Username],

I'm sorry you're feeling so rough. Side effects from augmentation therapy can definitely happen, especially in the first few infusions. Here's what you should know:

⚠️ IMPORTANT: I'm not a doctor, so I can't give medical advice. If you're concerned about your symptoms, please call your infusion center or doctor right away. They can advise you on whether this is normal or if you need to be seen.

That said, here's what I can share from what others in the community have experienced:

- Mild side effects (headache, fatigue, mild fever) are fairly common in the first few infusions
- These often get better as your body adjusts
- Pre-medicating with Tylenol or Benadryl (if your doctor approves) can help
- Slowing down the infusion rate can reduce side effects

I'm tagging some folks who've been through this:
- @[Username1]: Had side effects early on, shares tips that helped
- @[Username2]: Works at an infusion center, great insights
- @[Username3]: Recently started therapy, can relate

Please keep us posted on how you're doing. And again—if you're really worried, call your doctor. We're here to support you, but we can't replace medical advice.

Thinking of you,
[Community Manager Name]
```

### Scenario 3: Conflict Between Community Members

**Forum Exchange Example**:

> User A: "Augmentation therapy is the only way to slow disease progression."
> User B: "That's not true. I've managed my AATD for 10 years without augmentation."
> User A: "You're spreading dangerous misinformation."

**Response Protocol** (<2 hours)

```
Hi @[UserA] and @[UserB],

I appreciate both of you sharing your experiences. I want to jump in here to clarify and remind everyone of our community guidelines.

The truth is: AATD is different for everyone. Augmentation therapy is the standard treatment for many patients with severe deficiency (ZZ genotype, low lung function), but not everyone is a candidate, and not everyone chooses it. Both experiences are valid.

Let's keep this community a safe space where people can share their personal experiences without judgment. We can disagree respectfully without calling each other's choices "dangerous" or "wrong."

@[UserA]: I understand you feel strongly about augmentation therapy, and your experience is important. Please share your perspective without dismissing others' choices.

@[UserB]: Your experience managing AATD without augmentation is valuable, especially for those exploring different paths. Just be clear it's your personal experience, not medical advice.

Everyone's AATD journey is unique. Let's support each other, even when our paths look different.

If either of you want to discuss this further, feel free to DM me.

[Community Manager Name]
```

**Escalation**: If conflict continues, issue private warnings, then temporary bans if necessary.
