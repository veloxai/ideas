## 1️⃣ GETTING STARTED (NEWLY DIAGNOSED)

### Resource 1.1: What is Alpha-1? (Beginner's Guide)

**Format**: Web page + PDF (4 pages) + 3-minute video
**Reading Level**: 6th grade
**Length**: 1,200 words

**Content Outline**:

**Introduction**

- You've just been diagnosed with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD). You're probably scared, confused, and overwhelmed. That's normal.
- This guide will explain what AATD is in plain language—no medical jargon.

**Section 1: What is AATD?**

- Simple explanation: Your body doesn't make enough of a protein called Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT)
- Analogy: "Think of AAT as a shield that protects your lungs. Without enough of this shield, your lungs can get damaged over time."
- Genetic condition (inherited from parents)
- Rare, but more common than most people realize (1 in 2,500)

**Section 2: How Does AATD Affect You?**

- Can cause lung disease (emphysema/COPD), usually in adulthood
- Can cause liver disease (less common)
- Many people with AATD live normal, healthy lives
- Early diagnosis is good news (can start treatment and make lifestyle changes)

**Section 3: What Should You Do Now?**

1. Don't panic—many people with AATD live long, active lives
2. Talk to your doctor about testing your family members
3. If you smoke, QUIT (most important thing you can do)
4. Learn more (this website is a great start)
5. Connect with others (join our forum)

**Section 4: Common Questions**

- Will I die from this? (Many people with AATD live into their 70s-80s)
- Is there a cure? (No cure, but treatments can slow disease progression)
- Should my kids be tested? (Yes, talk to your doctor about family screening)
- Can I still live a normal life? (Yes! With treatment and lifestyle changes, most people do)

**Reading Level**: 7th grade
**Length**: 1,000 words

**Content Outline**:

**Why It's Hard to Talk About AATD**

- Rare disease (most people have never heard of it)
- Genetic (may feel guilty about passing to children)
- Fear of judgment ("Did I cause this?")

**How to Explain AATD Simply**

- Script: "I have a genetic condition called Alpha-1 that affects my lungs. My body doesn't make enough of a protein that protects lung tissue. It's treatable, and I'm working with my doctor on a plan."
- Avoid: Medical jargon, overly scary details

**Who Needs to Know**

- **Immediate family** (siblings, children, parents): Yes, they should be tested
- **Close friends**: Your choice (depends on level of support you need)
- **Employer**: Only if you need accommodations (flexible schedule for infusions, etc.)
- **Extended family**: Your choice

**Talking to Your Children**

- Age-appropriate explanation
- For young kids: "Mommy/Daddy has a condition that makes it harder to breathe sometimes. The doctors are helping me stay healthy."
- For teens: More detail, discuss genetic risk and testing

**Asking for Support**

- Be specific: "Can you come with me to my doctor appointment?" or "Can you help me quit smoking?"
- Set boundaries: "I don't want to talk about this every time we see each other."

**Resources**: Template letters for telling family about AATD and recommending testing
