[Funding Agency Name]
[Address]

**RE: Letter of Support for Alpha1Life.com Research Platform (PI: [Name], Mark Egly Foundation)**

Dear Review Panel Members,

On behalf of the Alpha-1 Foundation, I write to express our enthusiastic support for Dr. [Last Name]'s proposal to establish Alpha1Life.com, a comprehensive digital research platform for Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The Alpha-1 Foundation has partnered with the Mark Egly Foundation since 2015, and we view this project as a transformative opportunity to advance Alpha-1 research and patient care.

### Partnership Commitment

The Alpha-1 Foundation commits the following resources to this project:

1. **Biobank Infrastructure**: Our CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited biobank (University of Florida, 100,000-sample capacity) will process and store all 20,000 samples collected through Alpha1Life.com. We will provide:
   - Sample processing at cost ($15/sample, vs. $50 market rate)
   - Long-term storage (-80°C freezers with 24/7 monitoring)
   - Sample retrieval and shipping for approved research projects
   - Data linkage between biobank and Alpha1Life.com registry (de-identified)

2. **Existing Patient Registry**: We will facilitate recruitment by providing access to our existing registry (3,000 patients) for pilot testing and validation studies.

3. **Scientific Advisory Board**: Our SAB (6 pulmonologists, 2 hepatologists, 1 geneticist) will provide scientific oversight and ensure alignment with Foundation priorities.

4. **Patient Advocacy Network**: We will promote Alpha1Life.com through our channels (5,000 patients, quarterly newsletters, annual conference with 1,000 attendees), accelerating recruitment.

5. **Financial Support**: We commit $250K over 5 years ($50K/year) for biobank operations, ensuring sustainability beyond the grant period.

### Strategic Alignment

Alpha1Life.com directly addresses the Foundation's strategic priorities:

- **Accelerate diagnosis**: AI diagnostic assistant will identify 10,000+ undiagnosed patients
- **Enable precision medicine**: Genetic modifier discovery will guide personalized treatment
- **Speed clinical trials**: Trial-matching platform will reduce recruitment time by 75%
- **Improve quality of life**: Patient engagement programs will reduce isolation and improve mental health

This project represents the most ambitious Alpha-1 research infrastructure investment to date, positioning our community to compete for larger federal investments (e.g., NIH U01 consortia) and pharmaceutical partnerships.

### Track Record of Collaboration

Dr. [Last Name] has collaborated with the Alpha-1 Foundation on 5 prior projects (2018-present), demonstrating reliability, scientific rigor, and patient-centered approach. Their work on diagnostic delay (7.2 years average) and quality of life (A1QoL scale) has been widely cited and influenced our advocacy efforts.

### Letters of Commitment

Enclosed you will find:

1. **Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)** detailing biobank partnership terms (executed October 2024)
2. **Letter from Biobank Director** (Dr. [Name], University of Florida) confirming capacity and technical specifications

### Conclusion

The Alpha-1 Foundation strongly supports this application and urges its funding. Alpha1Life.com will transform Alpha-1 from a neglected rare disease into a model for precision medicine and patient-driven research. We are committed to ensuring this project's success and long-term sustainability.

Please contact me if you require additional information.

## LETTER 7: PATIENT ADVOCATE (COMMUNITY SUPPORT)

**[Personal Letterhead or Alpha-1 Foundation Letterhead]**

[Date]

[Grant Review Panel Name]
[Funding Agency Name]
[Address]

**RE: Letter of Support for Alpha1Life.com Research Platform**

Dear Review Panel Members,

As a ZZ Alpha-1 patient, community advocate, and member of the Alpha-1 Foundation Board of Directors, I write to express my strong personal support for Dr. [Last Name]'s Alpha1Life.com proposal.

### Why This Matters to Patients

I was diagnosed with Alpha-1 at age 35, after 8 years of seeing multiple doctors who dismissed my symptoms as "just asthma" or "anxiety." By the time I was correctly diagnosed, I had lost 40% of my lung function—damage that could have been prevented with early augmentation therapy.

My story is not unique. **97% of Alpha-1 patients remain undiagnosed**, and those who are diagnosed wait an average of 7.2 years. Alpha1Life.com will change this by:

1. **Finding the missing patients**: The AI diagnostic assistant will proactively identify undiagnosed patients in EHR systems, preventing the delays I experienced.

2. **Accelerating research**: A 25,000-patient registry and 20,000-sample biobank will enable discoveries about why some patients (like me) progress rapidly while others remain stable for decades.

3. **Speeding access to cures**: The trial-matching platform will help patients enroll in gene therapy trials, bringing us closer to a cure.

4. **Reducing isolation**: As a support group leader, I've seen firsthand how lonely Alpha-1 can be. Alpha1Life.com's engagement programs will connect patients nationwide.

### Community Support

I have discussed Alpha1Life.com with hundreds of Alpha-1 patients through my support group, at conferences, and on social media. **The response is overwhelmingly positive**. Patients are eager to:

- Join the registry (95% willing, based on survey)
- Donate biosamples (87% willing)
- Participate in support groups (78% interested)
- Enroll in clinical trials (92% interested)

### Personal Commitment

If funded, I commit to:

- Serving on the Community Advisory Board (unpaid)
- Promoting Alpha1Life.com through my networks (1,500 followers on social media)
- Co-presenting findings at patient conferences
- Advising on patient-facing materials to ensure accessibility

### Conclusion

Alpha1Life.com is the project our community has been waiting for. It's comprehensive, patient-centered, and led by a researcher (Dr. [Last Name]) who has earned our trust through years of collaboration. I urge you to fund this proposal.

For Mark Egly, who inspired this work. For the 100,000 Americans with Alpha-1. For the cure.

Sincerely,

[Signature]
