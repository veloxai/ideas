### Project Overview

Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (Alpha-1) affects 250,000 Americans, yet only 12% are diagnosed. This rare genetic disorder causes severe lung and liver disease, with no cure currently available. The Mark Egly Foundation proposes to build **Alpha1Life.com** - a comprehensive digital research platform that will:

1. **Establish the world's largest Alpha-1 patient registry** (25,000 patients, Years 1-5)
2. **Create a biobank of 20,000 biological samples** for genomic research
3. **Deploy AI diagnostic tools** to identify 10,000+ undiagnosed patients
4. **Enable precision medicine research** through multi-omic data integration
5. **Accelerate clinical trial recruitment** and improve patient outcomes

### Significance & Innovation

**Scientific Gap**: Alpha-1 research is fragmented across small institutional cohorts. No comprehensive patient registry exists that combines:

- Longitudinal clinical data (symptoms, lung function, treatments)
- Genetic data (whole genome sequencing, genetic modifiers)
- Biological samples (blood, tissue, DNA/RNA)
- Real-world outcomes (hospitalizations, quality of life, mortality)

**Innovation**: Alpha1Life.com creates a unified research infrastructure that enables:

- **Precision medicine** - Identify genetic modifiers that predict disease severity

## RESEARCH STRATEGY

### Significance

#### A. Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Background

**Disease Overview**:

- Genetic disorder (SERPINA1 gene mutation, chromosome 14)
- Causes AAT protein deficiency (<11 µM, normal >20 µM)
- Protease/antiprotease imbalance → lung destruction (emphysema)
- Toxic protein accumulation → liver damage (cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma)

**Epidemiology**:

- Prevalence: 1 in 2,500 (Northern European ancestry)
- 250,000 affected in US, 500,000 globally
- Only 12% diagnosed (30,000 in US, 100,000 globally)
- Average diagnostic delay: 7.2 years, 3+ doctors

**Clinical Burden**:

- Lung disease: COPD, emphysema (70% of patients), median survival 40-60 years
- Liver disease: Cirrhosis (10-15%), hepatocellular carcinoma (5%), median survival 50-70 years
- 5,000 lung transplants (cumulative, US)
- 1,000 liver transplants (cumulative, US)

**Current Treatment**:

- Augmentation therapy (IV AAT infusions, weekly, $100K/year) - slows lung decline 50%, not curative
- Lung transplant (severe disease, FEV1 <25%)
- Liver transplant (cirrhosis, liver failure)
- No cure (gene therapy in trials, not yet approved)

#### B. Critical Gaps in Alpha-1 Research

**Gap 1: Fragmented Data**

- Small institutional cohorts (100-500 patients each)
- No longitudinal data (most studies cross-sectional)
- No integrated registry (clinical + genetic + biobank)
- Result: Slow discoveries, redundant studies, wasted resources

**Gap 2: Underdiagnosis**

- Only 12% diagnosed (220,000 undiagnosed in US)
- Diagnostic delay 7.2 years (during which disease progresses)
- No systematic screening (PCPs don't test for Alpha-1)
- Result: Preventable lung/liver damage, missed treatment opportunities

**Gap 3: One-Size-Fits-All Treatment**

- All PiZZ patients get augmentation therapy (if FEV1 <80%)
- Same dose, same monitoring, regardless of disease severity
- No predictive biomarkers (who responds? who progresses rapidly?)
- Result: Undertreated (high-risk patients) + overtreated (low-risk patients)

**Gap 4: Slow Clinical Trials**

- Rare disease = small patient pools
- Recruitment difficult (patients don't know trials exist)
- 5-10% enrollment rate (90-95% of eligible patients never enroll)
- Result: Trials take 5-10 years, delayed drug approvals

**Gap 5: Patient Isolation**

- Rare disease = patients feel alone
- No centralized community (scattered Facebook groups, outdated forums)
- Lack of support (depression, anxiety common)
- Result: Poor mental health, reduced treatment adherence

#### C. How Alpha1Life.com Addresses Gaps

**Solution 1: Unified Research Infrastructure**

- Single registry (25,000 patients, longitudinal data)
- Integrated biobank (20,000 samples, genomics + proteomics)
- Standardized data collection (HL7 FHIR, CDISC standards)
- Result: Comprehensive dataset, accelerated discoveries

**Solution 2: AI-Powered Diagnosis**

- Machine learning models screen EHR data
- Identify undiagnosed patients (pattern recognition)
- Alert clinicians (Best Practice Advisories)
- Result: 10,000+ new diagnoses, reduce diagnostic delay to <2 years

**Solution 3: Precision Medicine**

- Genomics (identify genetic modifiers)
- Multi-omics (genomics + proteomics + metabolomics)
- Personalized risk scores (predict progression, treatment response)
- Result: Right treatment, right patient, right time

**Solution 4: Clinical Trial Acceleration**

- Automated patient-trial matching
- 25,000-patient registry (largest recruitment pool)
- Patient navigation (simplify enrollment)
- Result: 10x faster enrollment, accelerate drug development

**Solution 5: Community & Support**

- Digital platform (forums, support groups, mentorship)
- Patient engagement (research co-design, advocacy)
- Improved mental health (30% reduction in depression/anxiety)
- Result: Better patient outcomes, higher research participation

**Confidentiality**:

- Deidentified data for research (registry ID, no PHI)
- Limited PHI access (registry coordinators only, for patient contact)
- Data use agreements (all researchers sign)
- No data sale (nonprofit mission, no commercial data sharing)

### C. Potential Benefits

**To Subjects**:

- Access to clinical trial matching (potentially life-saving treatments)
- Precision medicine reports (personalized risk scores, treatment recommendations)
- Virtual support groups (mental health improvement)
- Contribution to research (altruism, cure for future generations)

**To Society**:

- Accelerated discoveries (genetic modifiers, biomarkers, treatments)
- Improved diagnosis (AI tools identify undiagnosed patients)
- Clinical trial efficiency (faster drug development)
- Healthcare cost savings ($44.75B over 15 years)

### D. Risk/Benefit Assessment

**Conclusion**: Risks are minimal, protections are adequate, benefits substantially outweigh risks.

## RESOURCE SHARING PLAN

### Data Sharing

**Commitment**: All registry data will be shared with qualified researchers (per NIH data sharing policy).

**Timeline**: Data available 1 year after publication (or immediately if no publication planned).

**Access**: Controlled access (researchers submit proposal to Data Access Committee).

**Format**: Deidentified CSV files, data dictionary included.

**Repository**: dbGaP (NIH database of Genotypes and Phenotypes) for genomics data, Alpha1Life.com portal for clinical data.

### Biospecimen Sharing

**Commitment**: Biobank samples available to qualified researchers (per NIH biospecimen sharing policy).

**Timeline**: Samples available immediately (no embargo).

**Access**: Researchers submit proposal to Biobank Committee (scientific merit, feasibility, budget).

**Cost**: Cost recovery only ($50-$200/sample depending on processing required).

**Shipping**: Dry ice, overnight FedEx, tracked.
