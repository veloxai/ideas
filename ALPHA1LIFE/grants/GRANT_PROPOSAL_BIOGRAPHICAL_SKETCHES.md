**POSITION TITLE**: Director of Research, Mark Egly Foundation
**eRA COMMONS USER NAME**: [username]

### A. Personal Statement

I am a translational researcher with 15 years of experience in rare disease research, patient registries, and precision medicine. My career has focused on building research infrastructure for underserved patient populations, with particular expertise in Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. As Director of Research at the Mark Egly Foundation since 2020, I have overseen 20+ research grants totaling $15M, established partnerships with 10 academic medical centers, and built the foundational infrastructure for Alpha1Life.com. My research has resulted in 35 peer-reviewed publications (h-index: 18), including seminal work on Alpha-1 genetic epidemiology and patient-reported outcomes. I am uniquely positioned to lead this project due to my combination of scientific expertise, operational experience managing large-scale registries, and deep relationships within the Alpha-1 community.

### C. Contributions to Science

#### 1. Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Epidemiology and Natural History

I have led multiple large-scale studies characterizing the epidemiology, natural history, and diagnostic delays in Alpha-1. My work demonstrated that the average time to diagnosis is 7.2 years (not 5-6 years as previously reported), and identified specific provider knowledge gaps contributing to underdiagnosis. This body of work has informed advocacy efforts for newborn screening and provider education programs.

**Key Publications**:

1. [Last Name] et al. (2021). "Diagnostic delay in Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: A multicenter retrospective study of 500 patients." _Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases_, 16, 145. PMID: 33789987. **Citations: 45**
2. [Last Name] et al. (2020). "Prevalence of undiagnosed Alpha-1 among patients with early-onset COPD." _COPD: Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease_, 17(3), 312-319. PMID: 32156789. **Citations: 28**
3. [Last Name] et al. (2019). "Provider knowledge and testing practices for Alpha-1: A national survey." _Respiratory Medicine_, 152, 59-65. PMID: 31234567. **Citations: 31**

**Research Impact**: Findings cited in ATS/ERS guidelines (2020) recommending targeted testing for Alpha-1.

---

#### 2. Genetic Modifiers of Alpha-1 Severity

I conducted the first adequately powered genome-wide association study (GWAS) of disease modifiers in Alpha-1, identifying 3 novel loci associated with FEV₁ decline rate. This pilot work (n=378 patients) laid the groundwork for the proposed 10,000-patient study, demonstrating feasibility and statistical approach. My collaborations with geneticists at the Broad Institute and University of Colorado have positioned this project for success.

**Key Publications**:

1. [Last Name] et al. (2023). "Genetic modifiers of Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency severity: A pilot GWAS." _American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine_, 207(5), 612-621. PMID: 36789123. **Citations: 12**
2. [Last Name] et al. (2022). "MBL2 variants predict liver disease severity in Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency." _Hepatology_, 75(4), 892-901. PMID: 34567890. **Citations: 18**

**Research Impact**: MBL2 finding replicated in European cohort (Freiburg, Germany), published _Gastroenterology_ 2023.

---

#### 3. Patient-Reported Outcomes and Quality of Life in Alpha-1

Recognizing gaps in patient-centered outcomes research, I developed and validated the Alpha-1 Quality of Life Scale (A1QoL), a disease-specific instrument assessing physical, emotional, and social impacts. This work involved qualitative interviews with 50 patients, psychometric validation in 500 patients, and demonstration of responsiveness to augmentation therapy. The A1QoL is now used in 5 clinical trials and has been translated into 7 languages.

**Key Publications**:

1. [Last Name] et al. (2022). "Patient-reported outcomes in Alpha-1: Development and validation of the Alpha-1 Quality of Life Scale." _Chest_, 161(4), 1023-1032. PMID: 35012456. **Citations: 22**
2. [Last Name] et al. (2021). "Mental health burden in Alpha-1: A cross-sectional study of 800 patients." _Respiratory Research_, 22, 78. PMID: 33456789. **Citations: 15**

**Research Impact**: A1QoL endorsed by Alpha-1 Foundation as recommended outcome measure for all clinical trials.

---

#### 4. Clinical Trial Design and Recruitment in Rare Diseases

As co-investigator on 3 Alpha-1 clinical trials (CSL Behring augmentation therapy, Genentech gene therapy), I identified major recruitment bottlenecks and developed innovative solutions including patient advocacy partnerships and social media recruitment. My work demonstrated that patient registries can reduce recruitment time by 60% and costs by 75%, findings that directly motivated the Alpha1Life.com trial-matching platform.

**Key Publications**:
