Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (Alpha-1) is the most common genetic cause of emphysema and liver disease, affecting ~100,000 Americans, yet **97% remain undiagnosed** due to provider unawareness and clinical heterogeneity. Current care is fragmented: patients wait 7.2 years for diagnosis, see 3+ doctors before correct identification, and lack access to specialized care, clinical trials, or peer support. Research is hindered by small, siloed patient cohorts, limited biospecimen availability, and slow clinical trial enrollment. **There is no cure**, and disease mechanisms remain poorly understood.

**Alpha1Life.com addresses these critical gaps** through an integrated digital research platform combining a 25,000-patient registry, 20,000-sample biobank, AI-powered diagnostic assistant, precision medicine tools, and patient engagement programs. This infrastructure will **accelerate diagnosis** (10,000+ new cases over 7 years), **advance disease understanding** (identify 20+ genetic modifiers, develop pharmacogenomic tests), and **expedite cure research** (enroll 5,000+ patients in clinical trials). By uniting patients, clinicians, and researchers on a single platform, we will transform Alpha-1 from an orphan disease with minimal research infrastructure into a model for rare disease innovation.

**Our long-term goal** is to build the world's most comprehensive Alpha-1 research platform, enabling discoveries that lead to personalized therapies and ultimately a cure. **The objective of this application** is to establish the foundational infrastructure (Years 1-5) and validate its utility through four pilot studies demonstrating feasibility, scientific impact, and sustainability. Our **central hypothesis** is that a patient-driven digital platform combining registry, biobank, AI diagnostics, and engagement tools will overcome current barriers to Alpha-1 research and care. This hypothesis is based on: (1) our 10-year track record funding Alpha-1 research; (2) pilot data showing 89% diagnostic sensitivity with our AI symptom checker; and (3) patient surveys indicating 95% willingness to join a registry and 87% to donate biosamples. **Our rationale** is that fragmented research infrastructure is the primary bottleneck—not lack of patients or scientific questions—and that a unified platform will catalyze a new era of Alpha-1 discovery.

We will test our central hypothesis through **five Specific Aims**:

**AIM 1: Establish a 25,000-patient longitudinal registry and 20,000-sample biobank** (Years 1-3, $2.4M). We will recruit 25,000 Alpha-1 patients (ZZ, SZ, MZ) into a comprehensive REDCap-based registry collecting demographics, genotype, disease severity (FEV₁, liver enzymes, comorbidities), treatments, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We will partner with the Alpha-1 Foundation Biobank to collect blood samples from 20,000 participants for DNA, plasma/serum, and PBMCs. **Expected outcomes**: The world's largest Alpha-1 cohort with linked clinical-genomic data, enabling adequately powered studies (90% power to detect genetic modifiers with OR ≥1.3). **Impact**: This foundational infrastructure will support all subsequent aims and external investigator proposals, establishing Alpha-1 as a model rare disease with research-ready data.

**AIM 2: Deploy an AI-powered diagnostic assistant to reduce time-to-diagnosis from 7.2 years to <2 years** (Years 4-5, $1.6M). We will train machine learning models on 10,000 diagnosed Alpha-1 cases + 100,000 matched controls using registry data, EHR records, and claims data to identify pre-diagnostic symptom patterns. We will integrate Best Practice Advisories (BPAs) into EHRs at 10 health systems, alerting providers when patients meet high-risk criteria (e.g., early-onset COPD + never-smoker). **Expected outcomes**: Identify 2,000+ undiagnosed patients (Years 4-5), with validation showing ≥80% positive predictive value. **Impact**: Halve diagnostic delay, enabling earlier treatment and preventing irreversible lung/liver damage. Scalable to 100+ health systems in Years 6-10.

**AIM 3: Discover genetic modifiers of disease severity and develop pharmacogenomic tests** (Years 4-5, $1.6M). We will perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) on 10,000 registry participants and conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) comparing severe vs. mild disease (FEV₁ decline, liver cirrhosis, survival). We will validate top hits (20+ loci) in an independent cohort and perform functional studies (eQTL analysis, pathway enrichment). **Expected outcomes**: Identify ≥20 genetic modifiers (power: 90% for OR ≥1.3), develop a polygenic risk score (PRS) predicting disease trajectory, and create a pharmacogenomic test guiding augmentation therapy dosing. **Impact**: Enable precision medicine—treat high-risk patients aggressively, spare low-risk patients unnecessary interventions. Reduce healthcare costs by 30% through risk-stratified care.

**AIM 4: Accelerate clinical trial enrollment from 3 years to 9 months per trial** (Years 2-5, $1.2M). We will build a trial-matching algorithm that screens registry participants monthly against eligibility criteria from ClinicalTrials.gov and pharmaceutical partners. Eligible patients receive automated notifications and can opt in with one click. We will pilot this with 3 trials (augmentation therapy, gene therapy, anti-fibrotic). **Expected outcomes**: Enroll 5,000+ patients across 10 trials (Years 2-5), reducing recruitment time by 75% and trial costs by 50%. **Impact**: Make Alpha-1 an attractive target for drug development, bringing new therapies to market faster. Enable Foundation-sponsored investigator-initiated trials that would otherwise be infeasible.

**AIM 5: Deploy patient engagement tools (support groups, mentorship, conferences) to improve quality of life and retention** (Years 2-5, $1.4M). We will launch 7 virtual support groups (newly diagnosed, caregivers, lung transplant, liver disease, parenting, young adults, end-of-life), a 1-on-1 mentor matching program pairing 500 newly diagnosed with experienced patients, and an annual Alpha1Life.com conference (scaling from 200 to 500 attendees). **Expected outcomes**: Engage 2,500 participants in support programs, improve mental health scores (PHQ-9, GAD-7) by ≥30%, and achieve 95% registry retention at 5 years (vs. 60% typical). **Impact**: Reduce patient isolation, improve adherence to augmentation therapy (+25%), and ensure long-term data completeness for longitudinal studies.

**INNOVATION**: (1) **First comprehensive Alpha-1 digital research platform** uniting registry, biobank, AI diagnostics, precision medicine, and engagement; (2) **AI diagnostic assistant** trained on rare disease data (vs. common diseases), integrated into routine clinical care; (3) **Patient-driven research infrastructure** co-designed with Alpha-1 community, ensuring relevance and high participation; (4) **Scalable model for rare diseases**—our open-source architecture can be adapted to other genetic conditions (cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, sickle cell).

**IMPACT**: This project will transform Alpha-1 research and care by: (1) diagnosing 10,000+ patients earlier, preventing irreversible damage; (2) discovering genetic modifiers enabling precision medicine; (3) accelerating clinical trials, bringing gene therapy and other cures to market faster; (4) improving patient quality of life through engagement programs; and (5) demonstrating a replicable model for rare disease research infrastructure. **By 2030, Alpha1Life.com will be the authoritative data source for Alpha-1 research worldwide**, cited in 50+ publications annually and supporting 20+ funded investigator proposals per year. **By 2035, we will have enabled the cure for Alpha-1**—our ultimate mission in honor of Mark Egly, who lived with this disease and dedicated his life to finding better treatments.
