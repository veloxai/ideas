## 1. STUDY OVERVIEW

### 1.1 Study Design

Alpha1Life.com is a longitudinal observational registry study with ancillary biobank and AI diagnostic validation components. The study involves:

- **Registry**: 25,000 Alpha-1 patients (ZZ, SZ, or MZ genotype) providing demographics, medical history, treatments, outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes via web-based surveys (Years 1-15)
- **Biobank**: 20,000 participants donating blood samples for DNA, plasma/serum, and PBMCs (Years 3-5)
- **AI Diagnostic Study**: 10,000 diagnosed patients + 100,000 controls (EHR/claims data) for model training; prospective validation in 1.45M patients (Years 4-5)
- **Clinical Trial Matching**: Automated matching to eligible trials with opt-in recruitment (Years 2-5)
- **Patient Engagement**: Virtual support groups, mentor matching, annual conference (Years 2-5)

### 1.2 Study Population

**Inclusion Criteria**:

- Age ≥18 years
- Self-reported diagnosis of Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (any genotype: ZZ, SZ, MZ, other rare variants)
- Able to provide informed consent in English (Spanish version available Year 2)
- Access to internet/smartphone

**Exclusion Criteria**:

- Age <18 years (due to complex consent for minors; pediatric registry planned for future)
- Unable to provide informed consent due to cognitive impairment
- Incarcerated individuals (due to regulatory complexity; may be included in future amendments)

**Expected Demographics**:

- Age: 18-85 years (median: 52)
- Sex: 45% male, 55% female (Alpha-1 affects both equally)
- Race/Ethnicity: 85% White, 5% Hispanic, 3% Black, 7% Other (reflects Alpha-1 epidemiology—predominantly European ancestry)
- Genotype: 60% ZZ, 25% SZ, 10% MZ, 5% rare variants

---

## 2. RISKS TO SUBJECTS

### 2.1 Privacy and Confidentiality Risks

**Nature of Risk**: Breach of protected health information (PHI) could result in:

- **Genetic discrimination**: Employers or insurers using Alpha-1 diagnosis against participant (though GINA protects against this in most cases)
- **Social stigma**: Alpha-1 associated with lung disease, liver disease, sometimes misperceived as self-inflicted (smoker's disease, alcoholic liver disease)
- **Family implications**: Alpha-1 is genetic; breach could reveal information about relatives

**Magnitude**: **MODERATE**

- Registry contains highly sensitive data: Name, date of birth, genotype, medical history, outcomes
- Genomic data (WGS) is uniquely identifiable—cannot be fully anonymized
- EHR data includes sensitive information (HIV status, substance use, mental health)

**Likelihood**: **LOW**

- Strong security measures in place (see Section 3.2)
- No prior breaches at Mark Egly Foundation (10-year track record)
- HIPAA-compliant infrastructure (BAAs with all vendors)

---

### 2.2 Psychological Risks

**Nature of Risk**: Participation may cause emotional distress:

**A. Genetic Counseling Results**

- Whole genome sequencing may reveal incidental findings (cancer predisposition genes, Alzheimer's risk variants, carrier status for other diseases)
- **Magnitude**: MODERATE for serious actionable findings (e.g., BRCA mutations)
- **Likelihood**: LOW (1-3% of participants will have actionable incidental findings)

**B. Support Group Participation**

- Hearing others' experiences with disease progression, death may trigger anxiety, depression
- **Magnitude**: MILD (most participants find support groups therapeutic, not distressing)
- **Likelihood**: MODERATE (10-20% of participants may experience transient distress)

**C. Survey Content**

- Mental health questions (PHQ-9, GAD-7) may prompt reflection on depression, suicidality
- **Magnitude**: MILD (surveys use validated instruments, similar to routine clinical care)
- **Likelihood**: LOW (<5% report distress from surveys)

---

### 2.3 Physical Risks (Biobank Only)

**Nature of Risk**: Blood draw may cause:

- Pain, bruising, bleeding
- Lightheadedness, fainting (vasovagal reaction)
- Infection (extremely rare with sterile technique)

**Magnitude**: **MINIMAL**

- Standard blood draw (40 mL total, equivalent to routine lab work)
- Performed by trained phlebotomists
- No more risk than routine clinical care

**Likelihood**: **MODERATE** (20-30% experience mild pain/bruising)

---

### 2.4 Risk of Genetic Discrimination

**Nature of Risk**: Despite GINA (Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, 2008), some theoretical risks:

**GINA Protections**:

- Health insurers CANNOT use genetic information to deny coverage or increase premiums
- Employers CANNOT use genetic information in hiring, firing, promotion decisions

**GINA GAPS**:

- Does NOT cover life insurance, disability insurance, long-term care insurance
- Does NOT apply to employers with <15 employees
- Does NOT apply to military personnel (military has own anti-discrimination policies)

**Magnitude**: **LOW**

- Most participants already diagnosed (discrimination already possible based on diagnosis, not just genetics)
- GINA protects 95% of employment and all health insurance situations

**Likelihood**: **VERY LOW**

- No documented cases of genetic discrimination against Alpha-1 patients in past 10 years (Alpha-1 Foundation surveillance)

---

### 2.5 Risk of Re-identification

**Nature of Risk**: De-identified data shared with researchers could theoretically be re-identified:

- Genomic data + age + ZIP code + rare disease diagnosis = potentially unique
- Published case studies (e.g., PGP-10, Havasupai Tribe) show re-identification risk

**Magnitude**: **LOW**

- Requires sophisticated computational methods and motivation (e.g., law enforcement, journalists)
- Unlikely to affect average participant

**Likelihood**: **VERY LOW**

- Data shared via dbGaP (controlled access, requires IRB approval)
- No direct identifiers in shared dataset
- Genomic data stripped of rare variants unique to single families

---

### 2.6 Risk of Ineligibility for Clinical Trials

**Nature of Risk**: Comprehensive phenotyping may reveal exclusion criteria (e.g., comorbidities, abnormal labs), making participant ineligible for desired trials

**Magnitude**: **MILD**

- Participants would learn this information eventually during trial screening
- Knowledge may be disappointing but not harmful

**Likelihood**: **MODERATE** (30-40% screened will be ineligible for any given trial due to strict criteria)

---

### 2.7 Economic Risks

**Nature of Risk**: Time burden of participation may cause lost wages, childcare costs

**Magnitude**: **MINIMAL**

- Registry surveys: 30-60 minutes every 6 months (online, flexible timing)
- Biobank visit: 1 hour (travel + blood draw)
- Support groups: 60-90 minutes/month (optional, virtual)

**Mitigation**: Travel reimbursement, flexible scheduling, online participation options

**Likelihood**: **LOW** (most participants can complete activities without economic impact)

**Withdrawal of Results**:

- If participant withdraws from study, no further results provided
- Results already delivered remain with participant (cannot "un-know" genetic information)

---

### 3.7 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan

**Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)**: **NOT REQUIRED**

- This is an observational registry (not an intervention study), so full DSMB not mandated by NIH
- However, PI will conduct internal monitoring as described below

**Internal Monitoring**:

- **Frequency**: Quarterly review by PI, project director, biostatistician
- **Metrics**:
  - Enrollment: On track to meet targets? (5,000 Year 1, 15,000 Year 2, 25,000 Year 3)
  - Retention: Attrition rate <5%/year? (Goal: 95% retention at Year 5)
  - Data quality: Missing data <10%? Survey completion rate >90%?
  - Adverse events: Any serious adverse events (SAEs)? Pattern suggesting systemic issue?
  - Protocol deviations: Any violations of inclusion/exclusion criteria, consent procedures?

**Stopping Rules**:

- **Data Breach** (>100 participants affected): Halt enrollment, investigate root cause, notify participants, remediate, IRB review before resuming
- **High Attrition** (>20% drop-out in single year): Investigate causes, implement retention strategies, IRB consultation
- **Serious Adverse Event Pattern** (>5 SAEs related to study procedures): Halt biobank, investigate, IRB review
- **Loss of Funding**: Notify participants, archive data securely, plan for long-term stewardship

**IRB Continuing Review**:

- Annually submit renewal to WCG IRB
- Include: Enrollment update, adverse events, protocol modifications, publications, any concerns

## 4. POTENTIAL BENEFITS

### 4.1 Benefits to Individual Participants

**Direct Benefits**:

1. **Return of Actionable Incidental Findings**: 1-3% of WGS participants will learn about cancer predisposition, cardiac risk, or other actionable genetic conditions, enabling prevention/early detection
2. **Access to Clinical Trials**: Trial-matching algorithm will connect participants to cutting-edge therapies (gene therapy, precision medicine) otherwise difficult to find
3. **Peer Support**: Support groups, mentor matching reduce isolation, improve mental health (30% improvement in PHQ-9/GAD-7 demonstrated in pilot)
4. **Education**: Annual conference, webinars, newsletters improve disease knowledge and self-management

**Indirect Benefits**: 5. **Contribute to Cure**: Altruistic satisfaction of advancing Alpha-1 research toward gene therapy and cure 6. **Advance Science**: Participants' data will generate 50+ publications, train next generation of Alpha-1 researchers

**Benefits Do NOT Include**:

- Compensation (no payment for participation; only travel reimbursement for biobank visit)
- Improved clinical care (participants should continue seeing their own doctors; registry is research, not treatment)

---

### 4.2 Benefits to Society

**Scientific Knowledge**:

- Identify 20+ genetic modifiers → precision medicine (tailor treatment to individual's genetic risk)
- Develop AI diagnostic tool → reduce diagnostic delay from 7.2 years to <2 years (prevent irreversible damage in 10,000+ future patients)
- Accelerate clinical trials → bring gene therapy and other cures to market faster (5+ years sooner)

**Healthcare System**:

- Early diagnosis → reduce misdiagnosis-related costs ($50K/patient × 10,000 patients = $500M saved)
- Precision medicine → avoid ineffective treatments, reduce side effects (30% improvement in outcomes, 20% cost reduction)

**Patient Community**:

- Support infrastructure (support groups, mentorship, conference) improves quality of life for all Alpha-1 patients, not just registry participants
- Advocacy tools (legislative tracker, sample letters) enable patients to advocate for newborn screening, insurance coverage

---

## 5. IMPORTANCE OF KNOWLEDGE TO BE GAINED

### 5.1 Scientific Significance

**Current State**: Alpha-1 research is hindered by:

- Small, fragmented patient cohorts (largest prior registry: 3,000 patients)
- Limited biospecimen availability (no comprehensive biobank)
- Lack of genetic understanding (only 1 modifier gene known: MBL2)
- Slow clinical trial recruitment (2-4 years to enroll 200 patients)

**Alpha1Life.com Will**:

- Create world's largest Alpha-1 cohort (25,000 patients, 8× larger than current largest)
- Enable adequately powered GWAS (90% power for OR≥1.3), discovering 20+ modifiers
- Validate AI diagnostic tool, enabling early detection of 10,000+ patients
- Reduce trial recruitment time by 75% (3 years → 9 months), accelerating therapy development

**Comparison to Alternative Approaches**:

- **Status quo** (continue with 3,000-patient Alpha-1 Foundation registry): Underpowered for genetic studies, no AI diagnostics, slow trials
- **Multi-center consortium** (10 academic centers, 500 patients each): Fragmented data, interoperability challenges, higher cost
- **Industry-sponsored registry** (pharma company): Conflict of interest, restricted data access, not patient-driven

**Why Alpha1Life.com is Superior**:

- **Patient-driven**: Governance by patients and Mark Egly Foundation (nonprofit), ensuring community priorities
- **Integrated**: Registry + biobank + AI + trials + engagement in one platform (synergies impossible in siloed approach)
- **Open science**: Data shared via dbGaP, publications open access (maximal impact)

---

### 5.2 Clinical Significance

**Impact on Patient Care**:

- **Early Diagnosis**: AI diagnostic assistant will identify 10,000+ undiagnosed patients in EHRs, enabling treatment before irreversible lung/liver damage
- **Precision Medicine**: Genetic modifiers and PRS will guide treatment decisions (high-risk patients get aggressive therapy, low-risk patients avoid unnecessary interventions)
- **Faster Access to Cures**: Trial-matching platform will enroll 5,000+ patients in clinical trials, bringing gene therapy to FDA approval 5+ years sooner

**Economic Impact**:

- Healthcare cost savings: $50K/patient × 10,000 early diagnoses = **$500M saved** (avoid misdiagnosis, ER visits, hospitalizations)
- Productivity gains: Early treatment prevents disability, extends working years (5-10 years gain per patient × 10,000 patients = 50,000-100,000 work-years)

**Equity Impact**:

- **Geographic**: Rural patients (30% of Alpha-1 population) often >500 miles from Alpha-1 Center of Excellence. Alpha1Life.com brings research participation and support to all patients (telehealth, virtual support groups, at-home biobank kits)
- **Racial/Ethnic**: Alpha-1 predominantly affects White populations, but 15% are Hispanic, 3% Black. Spanish-language materials (Year 2) and diverse recruitment strategies will ensure equity
- **Socioeconomic**: No-cost participation (travel reimbursement, free genetic counseling) removes financial barriers

---

### 5.3 Generalizability to Other Rare Diseases

**Alpha1Life.com as Model**:

- Open-source platform architecture (APIs, data standards) can be adapted to other genetic diseases (cystic fibrosis, sickle cell, hemophilia)
- Lessons learned (recruitment, engagement, AI diagnostics) will inform future NIH rare disease initiatives (e.g., NIH All of Us, Undiagnosed Diseases Network)
- Blueprint for patient-driven research: "By patients, for patients, with patients"

**Dissemination**:

- Publish implementation guide (open access) detailing platform architecture, recruitment strategies, patient engagement methods
- Present at rare disease conferences (NORD, Global Genes, EveryLife Foundation)
- Offer consulting to other patient advocacy organizations (30+ groups have expressed interest)

---

## 6. INCLUSION OF WOMEN, MINORITIES, AND CHILDREN

### 6.1 Inclusion of Women

**Target Enrollment**: 55% women (reflects Alpha-1 epidemiology; both sexes equally affected)

**Rationale for Inclusion**: Women with Alpha-1 have similar disease severity as men, though some studies suggest later onset (possible protective effect of estrogen pre-menopause). Inclusion essential to study sex-specific modifiers.

**Recruitment Strategies**:

- Target women-focused Alpha-1 support groups (Alpha-1 Foundation "Women with Alpha-1" network)
- Maternity leave-friendly participation (flexible survey schedules, remote biobank kits)
- Address barriers (childcare during conference attendance → kids' programming at annual conference)

---

### 6.2 Inclusion of Racial and Ethnic Minorities

**Target Enrollment**: 15% racial/ethnic minorities (reflects Alpha-1 epidemiology; predominantly White European ancestry)

**Alpha-1 Epidemiology by Race**:

- **White (non-Hispanic)**: 1 in 1,500 ZZ prevalence (highest)
- **Hispanic**: 1 in 3,000 ZZ prevalence (50% as common)
- **Black**: 1 in 10,000 ZZ prevalence (very rare)
- **Asian**: 1 in 50,000 ZZ prevalence (extremely rare)

**Why Predominantly White**: Alpha-1 (Z and S alleles) originated in Northern Europe ~2,000 years ago, spread via European migration

**Importance of Minority Inclusion**:

- Hispanic patients: Second-largest group, often underserved (language barriers, lower diagnosis rate)
- Black patients: Different genetic background (admixture) may reveal novel modifiers
- Asian patients: Rare, but case reports suggest different clinical presentation (more liver disease, less lung disease)

**Recruitment Strategies**:

- **Hispanic**: Spanish-language consent, surveys, support groups (Year 2); partner with Hispanic-serving health systems (LA County, Miami, South Texas)
- **Black**: Partner with African American churches, community centers; address mistrust (Tuskegee legacy) via community advisory board
- **Asian**: Partner with Asian American Health Initiative; translated materials (Mandarin, Cantonese)

**Equity Analysis**:

- Stratify all analyses by race/ethnicity
- Test AI diagnostic model for bias (equal performance across groups)
- Ensure PRS performs well in non-European ancestry (may require ancestry-specific PRS)

---

### 6.3 Inclusion of Children

**NOT INCLUDED in this application** (Age ≥18 years only)

**Rationale for Exclusion**:

- **Consent Complexity**: Minors cannot provide informed consent (require parental permission + child assent). Many Alpha-1 children have asymptomatic parents unaware of their own diagnosis (cannot consent for child if parent doesn't know they have Alpha-1)
- **Low Clinical Actionability**: Most Alpha-1 children are asymptomatic; augmentation therapy not FDA-approved for children (no established benefit)
- **Psychological Risk**: Genetic counseling for children raises complex issues (right not to know, impact on self-image during adolescence)

**Future Pediatric Registry** (Years 6-10):

- Once adult registry established, will pursue separate R01 for pediatric cohort (ages 0-17)
- Recruitment: Families with known Alpha-1 (parents in adult registry can enroll children)
- Focus: Natural history of pediatric liver disease (10-15% of ZZ children have elevated liver enzymes), long-term outcomes of newborn-detected cohorts

---

## 7. MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT

### 7.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB)

**IRB of Record**: WCG IRB (formerly WIRB Copernicus Group)

- **IRB Registration**: IRB00000000 (OHRP)
- **Type**: Commercial, independent IRB (specializes in multi-site studies)

**Initial Approval**:

- Submit full protocol, consent forms, recruitment materials to WCG IRB (45-60 days review)
- Address reviewer comments (1-2 rounds typical)
- Approval expected 3 months after submission

**Continuing Review**:

- Annual renewal required
- Submit: Enrollment update, adverse events, protocol modifications, publications, consent form updates
- Review typically 2-4 weeks

**Modifications**:

- Protocol amendments (e.g., add new survey, change biobank sample volume): Submit to IRB, await approval before implementing
- Administrative changes (e.g., update phone number): Notify IRB, no approval needed

**Reliance Agreements** (Single IRB Model):

- Health system partners (Cleveland Clinic, National Jewish, UF, etc.) cede IRB review to WCG IRB (NIH policy for multi-site studies)
- Individual Investigator Agreements (IIAs) executed with each site PI

---

### 7.2 Data Safety Monitoring

**Adverse Event Reporting**:

**Definitions**:

- **Adverse Event (AE)**: Any unfavorable event related to study participation (e.g., bruising from blood draw, emotional distress from survey)
- **Serious Adverse Event (SAE)**: Death, hospitalization, disability, life-threatening event, congenital anomaly

**Reporting Timelines**:

- **SAEs**: Report to IRB within 24 hours (email, phone call)
- **Unanticipated Problems**: Report to IRB within 5 business days
- **AEs (non-serious)**: Report in annual continuing review

**Causality Assessment**:

- PI determines if AE is related to study procedures (definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely, not related)
- Example: Bruising from blood draw → **definitely related**
- Example: Participant diagnosed with lung cancer during study → **not related** (Alpha-1 causes cancer risk, not study participation)

**Review Process**:

- PI reviews all AEs monthly
- Biostatistician analyzes for patterns (e.g., higher AE rate in certain subgroup)
- If pattern detected: Investigate, modify protocol if needed, notify IRB

## 8. SUMMARY: RISK-BENEFIT ANALYSIS

### 8.1 Risks (Summary)

| Risk                         | Magnitude     | Likelihood   | Mitigation                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Privacy breach               | Moderate      | Low          | Encryption, access controls, BAAs, audit logs                      |
| Genetic discrimination       | Low           | Very Low     | GINA protections, Certificate of Confidentiality                   |
| Psychological distress       | Mild-Moderate | Low-Moderate | Genetic counseling, mental health monitoring, crisis protocol      |
| Physical injury (blood draw) | Minimal       | Moderate     | Trained phlebotomists, sterile technique, adverse event monitoring |
| Re-identification            | Low           | Very Low     | De-identification, controlled access (dbGaP), rare variant removal |

**Overall Risk**: **MINIMAL TO LOW** (comparable to routine clinical care and typical registry studies)

### 8.2 Benefits (Summary)

| Benefit                          | Magnitude | Likelihood     | Beneficiaries                     |
| -------------------------------- | --------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Actionable incidental findings   | Moderate  | Low (1-3%)     | Individual participants           |
| Access to clinical trials        | Moderate  | Moderate (20%) | Individual participants           |
| Improved mental health (support) | Moderate  | High (80%)     | Individual participants           |
| Early diagnosis (AI tool)        | High      | High           | Society (10,000+ future patients) |
| Precision medicine (PRS)         | High      | High           | Society (all Alpha-1 patients)    |
| Accelerate cure (gene therapy)   | Very High | Moderate       | Society (all Alpha-1 patients)    |

**Overall Benefit**: **MODERATE (individual) to VERY HIGH (society)**

---

### 8.3 Risk-Benefit Ratio

**Conclusion**: Benefits **substantially outweigh** risks.

**Justification**:

- Risks are minimal (comparable to routine care) and well-mitigated
- Individual benefits (clinical trial access, support) are meaningful
- Societal benefits (early diagnosis, precision medicine, cure) are transformative
- No alternative approach offers comparable benefits with lower risk

**Ethics Committee Review** (Mark Egly Foundation):

- Proposal reviewed by internal ethics committee (October 2024)
- Unanimous approval: "Risk-benefit ratio highly favorable, protocol ethically sound"

**END OF PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS**

**Summary**: Alpha1Life.com poses minimal to low risks (privacy, psychological, physical) that are well-mitigated through robust safeguards (encryption, genetic counseling, mental health monitoring, IRB oversight). Benefits to individuals (clinical trial access, support, incidental findings) and society (early diagnosis of 10,000+ patients, precision medicine, accelerated cure) substantially outweigh risks. The study is ethically justified and essential to advancing Alpha-1 research and care.

**For the protection of research participants. For the advancement of science. For the cure.**
