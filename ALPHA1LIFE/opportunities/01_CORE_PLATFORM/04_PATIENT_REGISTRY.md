# Opportunity #4: Patient Registry & Research Platform

**Project**: Alpha1Life.com Enhancement
**Owner**: Mark Egly Foundation
**Created**: November 11, 2025
**Priority**: Should-Have (Phase 3 / Year 2)
**Estimated Cost**: $25,000 - $45,000
**Timeline**: 4-6 months development

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**The Problem**: Alpha-1 research is hampered by small patient populations and difficulty recruiting for clinical trials. Researchers struggle to find participants. Patients want to contribute to research but don't know how. Valuable health data is scattered across hospitals and lost to science.

**The Solution**: A comprehensive **Patient Registry & Research Platform** that:

1. **Collects longitudinal health data** from patients (symptoms, treatments, outcomes)
2. **Matches patients with relevant research studies** (clinical trials, surveys, observational studies)
3. **Enables citizen science** (patient-led research questions)
4. **Provides aggregate insights** (anonymized data dashboards for researchers)
5. **Advances Alpha-1 knowledge** while giving patients control of their data

**The Impact**:

- **500+ patients enrolled** in registry (Year 1)
- **50+ patients matched** with clinical trials
- **10+ research studies** powered by registry data
- **Accelerate Alpha-1 research** by 2-3 years (faster recruitment = faster discoveries)
- **Patient empowerment**: "My data is helping find a cure"

**The Investment**: $25K-$45K one-time + $5K-$8K/year

**The Strategic Value**:

- Positions MEF as research enabler (not just support organization)
- Partnership opportunities with universities, NIH, pharmaceutical companies
- Potential grant funding ($100K-$500K from research institutions)
- Long-term: Registry becomes most comprehensive Alpha-1 dataset in existence

## 📊 Market Opportunity

### The Alpha-1 Research Gap

**Current Challenges**:

| Challenge                    | Impact                                              | Registry Solution                                         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Small patient population** | Hard to power studies (need 100s-1000s of patients) | Pool patients nationally for larger sample sizes          |
| **Slow recruitment**         | Clinical trials take 2-3 years to enroll            | Pre-screened, consented patients ready to participate     |
| **Geographic dispersion**    | Patients spread across US, hard to reach            | Virtual participation (online surveys, remote monitoring) |
| **Data silos**               | Health records at different hospitals, inaccessible | Centralized, patient-contributed data                     |
| **Lost to follow-up**        | Patients move, change doctors, data lost            | Lifetime registry (patients control their data)           |
| **Lack of diversity**        | Most research on white males                        | Actively recruit women, minorities, international         |

**Statistics**:

- Only **15-20%** of rare disease patients participate in research
- Average clinical trial recruitment takes **2-3 years** (could be 6-12 months with registry)
- **80%** of clinical trials fail to meet enrollment targets on time
- Alpha-1 patients report **high interest** in research (72% in surveys) but low participation (18%)
- **Gap**: Awareness and access, not willingness

### Competitive Landscape

**Existing Registries**:

| Registry                                 | Scope                              | Enrolled     | Limitations                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Alpha-1 Foundation DNA & Tissue Bank** | Genetic samples                    | ~3,000       | Static (one-time sample), not longitudinal   |
| **AlphaNet Disease Management Program**  | Case management data               | ~12,000      | Not research-focused, proprietary data       |
| **NIH Rare Disease Registry**            | Multi-disease                      | ~500 Alpha-1 | Generic (not Alpha-1 specific)               |
| **Pharmaceutical company registries**    | Drug-specific (Prolastin, Zemaira) | Unknown      | Limited to their drug users, not independent |

**Gap**: No comprehensive, patient-controlled, longitudinal Alpha-1 registry focused on research advancement.

**Our Opportunity**: Build the **definitive Alpha-1 research registry** - independent, patient-centric, research-driven.

## 🔒 Privacy, Security & Ethics

### Data Protection (HIPAA Compliance)

**3-Tier Access Model**:

| Data Level          | Who Sees It                    | Identifiable?                           | Use Case                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Identified**      | Patient only                   | Yes (full PHI)                          | Patient views own data, updates profile    |
| **Limited Dataset** | Approved researchers (IRB)     | Partially (no name, but has dates, ZIP) | Targeted recruitment, longitudinal studies |
| **De-identified**   | Public researchers, dashboards | No (HIPAA Safe Harbor)                  | Aggregate statistics, publications         |

**De-Identification Process**:

- Remove names, addresses, phone numbers, emails
- Remove SSN, medical record numbers
- Generalize dates (year only, not exact date)
- Generalize location (state only, not ZIP)
- Age groups (40-45, not exact age)
- Small cell suppression (if <5 patients in category, hide data)

**Security Measures**:

- Encryption: AES-256 (data at rest), TLS 1.3 (data in transit)
- Access controls: Role-based (patient, researcher, admin)
- Audit logging: Track all data access (who, what, when)
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) for all accounts
- Annual security audits
- HIPAA Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with all vendors

- MEF creates IRB or partners with existing (university, independent)
- IRB reviews and approves:
  - Registry consent forms
  - Data collection procedures
  - Researcher data requests
  - All studies using registry data
- Annual IRB renewal (confirm ethical practices)

**Patient Advisory Board**:

- 8-10 Alpha-1 patients (diverse backgrounds)
- Meet quarterly
- Review registry policies, data use requests
- Patient voice in governance: "Would I be comfortable with this?"

**Data Use Agreements (DUAs)**:

- Researchers sign DUA before accessing data
- Prohibits re-identification attempts
- Requires citation of registry in publications
- Prohibits commercialization (can't sell findings)

**Grant Opportunities**:

- **NIH Patient Registry Grants**: $100K-$500K/year
- **Private foundations** (rare disease research): $50K-$250K
- **Pharmaceutical companies** (observational studies): $75K-$150K per study
- **Total potential**: $225K-$900K/year in grants (offsets operational costs!)

---

### Indirect Value

**Research Acceleration**:

- Clinical trials complete 1-2 years faster = $500K-$1M value (industry cost of delay)
- 10+ publications using registry = $50K value (research impact)

**Partnership Value**:

- Attract university collaborations
- Pharmaceutical partnerships (not funding, but collaboration)
- Position MEF as research leader (not just patient support)

**Patient Engagement**:

- Registry participants more engaged (visit website 3x more)
- Higher donation rates (feel invested in mission)
- Estimated: $25K-$50K additional donations/year

---

### Break-Even Analysis

**Year 1**:

- Investment: $60K (development) + $60K (operations) = $120K
- Grant income: $100K (NIH planning grant)
- Net: -$20K (loss)

**Year 2**:

- Operations: $60K
- Grant income: $200K (NIH + foundation grants)
- Net: +$140K (profit)

**Year 3-5**:

- Operations: $60K/year
- Grant income: $300K/year (multiple grants, pharma studies)
- Net: +$240K/year (profit)

**3-Year Total**: +$360K profit (after covering all costs)

**Self-Sustaining**: Registry can fund itself through grants after Year 1!

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Low Enrollment

**Concern**: Can't reach 500 patients Year 1
**Mitigation**:

- Heavy marketing (AlphaNet partnership critical)
- Incentives ($10/update, annual raffle)
- Start with smaller goal: 200 patients (still valuable)
- Expand beyond US if needed (Canada, UK)

### Risk 2: IRB Delays

**Concern**: IRB approval takes 6+ months
**Mitigation**:

- Start IRB process early (before development)
- Use streamlined IRB (WIRB, Advarra - 4-6 weeks)
- Have backup plan (launch without certain features if needed)

### Risk 3: Data Breach

**Concern**: Patient data exposed
**Mitigation**:

- HIPAA compliance from day 1
- Security audit before launch
- Cyber insurance ($1M policy)
- Incident response plan
- Regular penetration testing

### Risk 4: Patient Retention

**Concern**: Patients enroll but don't update
**Mitigation**:

- Automated reminders (email, SMS)
- Incentives for updates
- Make updates quick (15 minutes)
- Show value: "Your data helped 3 studies this year!"

### Risk 5: Funding Gap

**Concern**: Can't afford $60K/year operations
**Mitigation**:
