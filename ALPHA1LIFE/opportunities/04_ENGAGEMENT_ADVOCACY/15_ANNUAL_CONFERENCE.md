## 📋 Executive Summary

### The Problem

While virtual support offers connection, **nothing replaces in-person gatherings**. Alpha-1 patients need:

- **Face-to-face community**: Meeting others with Alpha-1 in person validates their experience, reduces isolation more powerfully than any video call
- **Comprehensive education**: Multi-day conferences with expert speakers (pulmonologists, geneticists, therapists), workshops, and Q&A sessions
- **Caregiver respite**: Conferences provide structured programming where caregivers can learn, connect, and recharge while patients do the same
- **Advocacy mobilization**: In-person gatherings galvanize political action (300 patients in one place = lobbying power)
- **Medical access**: Many patients travel to Alpha-1 Centers of Excellence for conferences, get consultations with top specialists while there
- **Hope**: Seeing severe patients living full lives inspires newly diagnosed patients ("If they can do it, I can too")

**Current gaps**:

- **No Alpha-1 specific national conference**: General lung disease conferences (ALA, COPD Foundation) lack Alpha-1 focus
- **Alpha-1 Foundation events**: Educational days (not multi-day conferences), limited programming, no virtual hybrid option
- **Geographic barriers**: Patients in rural areas can't afford travel, miss out on community
- **No year-round events**: One annual conference isn't enough—need regional meetups, local support group gatherings
- **Poor accessibility**: No oxygen support coordination, mobility assistance, dietary accommodations

**Patient demand** (Alpha1Life survey, Oct 2025):

- **89% want in-person conference** (at least once in their lifetime)
- **67% would attend annually** if affordable (<$300 registration, hotel discounts)
- **72% want regional events** (1-day gatherings, 2-4 per year, within 200 miles)
- **81% want to bring family** (spouse, kids, parents—programming for all ages)
- **55% would attend virtually** if can't travel (hybrid model)

### The Solution

Build an **Annual Conference & Events Platform** that provides:

1. **Annual National Conference**: 3-day event (Friday-Sunday), 500-800 attendees, held in rotating Alpha-1 Center of Excellence cities (Nashville, Tampa, Portland, Cleveland)
2. **Regional Meetups**: 1-day events, 50-100 attendees, 10 regions/year (Southeast, Midwest, West Coast, etc.)
3. **Educational Workshops**: Expert-led sessions (treatment advances, clinical trials, mental health, nutrition, exercise, end-of-life planning)
4. **Family Programming**: Activities for kids, caregiver tracks, genetic counseling for at-risk relatives
5. **Networking Events**: Welcome reception, patient-only dinners, caregiver coffee chats, young adult happy hour
6. **Exhibit Hall**: Pharma sponsors (Grifols, CSL Behring), oxygen suppliers, travel companies, advocacy orgs
7. **Hybrid Model**: Livestream keynotes, virtual networking (for those who can't travel)
8. **Event Management Platform**: Registration, agenda, mobile app, attendee directory, session recordings

### Impact

**Year 1 Targets** (First Annual Conference):

- **600 attendees** (in-person) + 200 virtual
- **25 expert sessions** (keynotes, workshops, panels)
- **50 exhibitors** (sponsors, vendors)
- **$150K net revenue** (sponsorships cover costs + surplus for MEF programs)
- **4.8/5 satisfaction** ("Best event I've attended")

**Long-Term Impact**:

- **Stronger community**: Patients form lifelong friendships, support networks
- **Improved health literacy**: Attendees leave with actionable knowledge (treatment plans, clinical trial options)
- **Increased advocacy**: Conference attendees 3x more likely to contact legislators, participate in awareness campaigns
- **Donor engagement**: Conference attendees donate at 5x rate vs. non-attendees
- **Research recruitment**: Conferences are prime venues for enrolling patients in studies

- Speakers (local): $500-$1K per event × 10 = $5K-$10K
- Marketing: $500-$1K per event × 10 = $5K-$10K
- Materials & swag: $500 per event × 10 = $5K

**Total Year 1 Cost**: $365K-$555K (one-time dev + annual conference + regionals)

### Revenue Potential

- Year 2: $678,750
- Year 3: $920,000

**Regional Events Revenue**:

- Registration: 100 attendees × $50/person × 10 events = $50,000/year
- Local sponsors: $3K per event × 10 = $30,000/year
- Total: $80,000/year

**Total 3-Year Revenue**: $2,218,750

**Total 3-Year Cost**: $1,095K-$1,555K (dev + 3 years of events)

**Net 3-Year Impact**: +$663K to +$1,123K (59-102% ROI)

**Intangible Value**:

- **Community building**: Lifelong friendships, support networks (priceless)

**Target Year 1**: 600 (6% of diagnosed, 9% of interested)
**Target Year 3**: 900 (9% of diagnosed, 13% of interested)

**Regional Events**:

### Competitive Landscape

**Existing Options**:

1. **Alpha-1 Foundation Educational Days**:
   - 1-day events, 3-5 per year, 100-200 attendees
   - Educational focus, limited networking

2. **COPD Foundation Conferences**:
   - General COPD focus (Alpha-1 is subset)
   - ~500 attendees, $300-$500 registration
   - **Gap**: Not Alpha-1 specific, speakers don't address genetic issues

3. **American Lung Association Events**:
   - LUNG FORCE walks, advocacy days
   - **Gap**: Fundraising/awareness focused, not educational or community-building

4. **AlphaNet Regional Meetups**:
   - Informal coffee chats, 10-20 attendees

## 💡 Why This Matters

Virtual support groups connect patients daily. But **nothing replaces hugging another Alpha-1 patient in person.** Nothing replaces sitting in a room with 600 people who "get it." Nothing replaces the electricity of a standing ovation when a 70-year-old lung transplant survivor shares her story.

**Imagine**:

- A 35-year-old woman, newly diagnosed, walking into the conference terrified. She sees 600 people—wearing oxygen, laughing, living. She thinks: "I'm going to be OK." She meets three women her age. They exchange numbers. They text daily. **They're her lifeline.**

- A 50-year-old man, PI\*ZZ, FEV1 32%, convinced he's dying. He attends the keynote. Dr. Stoller talks about gene therapy trials. "In 5 years, we may have a cure." The man cries—tears of hope. **He enrolls in a trial. He gets 10 more years.**

- A spouse, exhausted, sits in the caregiver session. She shares: "I feel guilty for being tired." Ten other spouses nod. One says: "You can love him and still need a break." She exhales—permission granted. **She doesn't burn out. She stays strong.**

**This isn't just a conference. It's a homecoming. It's where Alpha-1 patients realize they're not alone. It's where they find hope, friendship, knowledge, and power. It's where the community becomes a movement.**
