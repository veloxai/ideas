## 🎯 Content Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Patient-First Language**

- Write like you're talking to a friend who just got scary medical news
- Avoid medical jargon; when you must use it, define it immediately
- Use "you" and "your" (not "patients" or "the patient")
- Be honest but hopeful

**Example - WRONG**:

> "Individuals diagnosed with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency typically present with pulmonary manifestations including emphysematous changes and may require augmentation therapy."

**Example - RIGHT**:

> "If you have Alpha-1, you might notice trouble breathing or getting short of breath easily. This happens because your lungs aren't as protected as they should be. The good news? There's a treatment called augmentation therapy that can help."

---

**2. Progressive Disclosure**

- Start simple, add complexity gradually
- Use expandable sections for detailed information
- Offer "Quick Read" and "Full Details" versions

**Example Structure**:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🫁 WHAT IS AUGMENTATION THERAPY?      │
│                                        │
│ THE QUICK VERSION:                     │
│ It's a treatment that gives your body  │
│ the protective protein it's missing.   │
│ You get it through an IV once a week.  │
│                                        │
│ [LEARN MORE ▼]                         │
│                                        │
│ ━━━ (Expanded when clicked) ━━━       │
│                                        │
│ THE DETAILED VERSION:                  │
│ Augmentation therapy replaces the      │
│ alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein...   │
│ [Full detailed explanation]            │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**3. Show, Don't Just Tell**

- Use patient stories to illustrate concepts
- Include photos, videos, infographics
- Provide real examples, not just theory

---

**4. Acknowledge Emotions**

- Validate fears and concerns
- Address the emotional journey, not just medical facts
- Include mental health and coping resources

**Example**:

> "It's completely normal to feel scared, overwhelmed, or even angry after your diagnosis. Many patients tell us the first few months are the hardest. You're not alone in feeling this way."

---

**5. Empower Action**

- Every page should have clear next steps
- Provide tools, checklists, worksheets
- "What you can do today" sections

---

## ✍️ Writing Guidelines

### Voice & Tone

**Voice** (consistent across all content):

- Warm and compassionate
- Knowledgeable but not condescending
- Empowering, not patronizing
- Honest and transparent

**Tone** (varies by context):

| Page Type            | Tone Example                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Diagnosis info**   | Empathetic, reassuring: "This is manageable"     |
| **Treatment info**   | Clear, factual, hopeful: "Here's what to expect" |
| **Patient stories**  | Inspiring, authentic, relatable                  |
| **Donation pages**   | Urgent but not desperate, impact-focused         |
| **Forum guidelines** | Supportive but firm, community-focused           |

---

### Plain Language Standards

**Reading Level**: 6th-8th grade (Flesch-Kincaid score: 60-80)

**Rules**:

1. **Short sentences**: 15-20 words max
2. **Short paragraphs**: 3-4 sentences max
3. **Active voice**: "Your body makes a protein" not "A protein is made by your body"
4. **Common words**: "use" not "utilize", "help" not "facilitate"
5. **Define acronyms**: "Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD)" on first use

**Testing Tools**:

- Hemingway Editor (target Grade 8 or lower)
- Readable.com
- Grammarly readability score

---

### Formatting Standards

**Headings**:

- H1: Page title (once per page)
- H2: Major sections
- H3: Subsections
- Use emoji sparingly in headings for visual interest (🫁 💊 💙)

**Lists**:

- Use bullet points for unordered lists
- Use numbered lists only for sequential steps
- Keep list items parallel in structure

**Emphasis**:

- **Bold** for key terms and important points
- _Italic_ for gentle emphasis (rarely)
- Never use ALL CAPS (except acronyms)
- Avoid underlining (looks like links)

**Links**:

- Descriptive link text: "Learn about augmentation therapy" not "Click here"
- Open external links in new tabs
- Use [Read more] buttons for longer content

**Images**:

- Alt text for all images (accessibility)
- Captions that add context, not just describe
- Real patient photos preferred over stock photos
- Diverse representation in all imagery

---

### Medical Accuracy & Review

**Content Review Process**:

1. **Writer** creates draft (patient-friendly language)
2. **Medical Advisor** reviews for accuracy (MD/DO with AATD expertise)
3. **Patient Reviewer** reads for clarity (actual AATD patient)
4. **Editor** polishes final copy
5. **Legal** reviews disclaimers (if medical advice-adjacent)

**Required Disclaimers**:

All medical content pages must include:

> **Medical Disclaimer**: This information is for educational purposes only and should not replace professional medical advice. Always consult your doctor about your specific condition and treatment options.

For treatment/medication pages:

> **Important**: Treatment decisions should be made with your healthcare provider based on your individual health status, test results, and medical history.
