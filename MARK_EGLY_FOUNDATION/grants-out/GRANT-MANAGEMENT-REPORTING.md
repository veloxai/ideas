## Grant Management Overview

### Philosophy of Grant Stewardship

The Mark Egly Foundation views grant management as a **partnership** between the Foundation and funded researchers. Our approach balances:

**Accountability**: Ensuring grant funds are used as intended and produce results
**Flexibility**: Allowing researchers to adapt to new findings and opportunities
**Support**: Providing resources to help grantees succeed
**Transparency**: Open communication about progress, challenges, and outcomes

- ✅ Supplies: Reagents, lab supplies, software licenses (project-specific)
- ✅ Equipment: Instruments, computers (if justified and <$5,000; >$5,000 requires prior approval)
- ✅ Travel: Conference registration, airfare, lodging (for presenting Foundation-funded work)
- ✅ Patient Costs: Recruitment, incentives, transportation, medical procedures (if research-related)
- ✅ Publication Fees: Open access charges, page charges (up to $3,000 per article)
- ✅ Subawards: To collaborating institutions (if in approved budget)
- ✅ Indirect Costs: Up to 10% (or pre-negotiated rate)

**Unallowable Costs**:

- ❌ Entertainment: Meals for PI or staff (unless patient/participant meals for research purposes)
- ❌ Alcohol: Any alcoholic beverages
- ❌ Gifts: To study participants beyond approved incentives
- ❌ Capital Equipment: Major equipment >$5,000 without prior approval
- ❌ Tuition: For PI or staff degree programs
- ❌ Institutional Infrastructure: Renovation, maintenance, general facilities
- ❌ Lobbying: Political activities or advocacy
- ❌ Other Grants: Using Foundation funds to support other unrelated projects

**Red Flags** (trigger audit or investigation):

- Excessive unspent funds (>25% at annual report)
- Significant cost overruns without explanation or prior approval
- Spending on unallowable cost categories
- Lack of documentation for expenditures
- Discrepancies between financial and progress reports

### Payment Schedule & Installments

**Standard Payment Schedule** (multi-year grants):

- **Year 1**: 33% at start, 33% after Year 1 report approved
- **Year 2**: 34% after Year 2 report approved (if 3-year grant)
- **Final Year**: Final 10% after final report and closeout approved

**Pilot/Rapid Response** (1-year grants):

- 50% at start, 50% at midpoint (6 months) or upon final report

**Holdback Provision**:

- Foundation may withhold final 10-25% until final report approved
- Incentivizes timely reporting and project completion

**Early Payment Requests** (rarely approved):

- Must justify urgent need (e.g., major equipment purchase with discount if paid upfront)
- Requires detailed justification and revised spending plan
- Approved on case-by-case basis

---

## Intellectual Property Management

### IP Ownership

**Institution Owns IP**:

- Per Bayh-Dole Act (if government funds ever involved) and standard practice
- Inventors (PI and team) typically receive share per institutional IP policy

**Foundation Rights**:

- Non-exclusive, royalty-free license for non-commercial use
  - Educational materials
  - Patient advocacy
  - Public health campaigns
- Foundation may use results in communications without restriction

**Commercial Licensing**:

- Institution free to license to companies
- Foundation has right of first negotiation (optional, negotiable in grant agreement)
- No obligation to license to Foundation or provide revenue share (unless specified)

### Revenue Sharing (Optional)

**Scenario**: Research leads to patentable invention that is licensed to company

**Negotiable Revenue Share**:

- Typically 2-5% of net revenues to Foundation
- Reinvested in future AATD research grants
- Foundation may waive in favor of broader patient access (lower drug prices)

**Example**:

- Grantee develops novel diagnostic assay for AATD
- Licensed to DX company for $1M upfront + 5% royalties
- Negotiated agreement: Foundation receives 2% of royalties → ~$40K/year → Funds future diagnostic research

**Decision Factors**:

- Size of Foundation investment (larger grant → stronger case for revenue share)
- Patient benefit (if lower cost to patients, Foundation may waive)
- Institutional policies (some institutions prohibit revenue sharing with funders)

### Mark Egly's Patent

**Special Consideration**: Mark Egly has patent on repurposed AAT protein (firefighters, military, asthma)

**Foundation Interest**:

- Grantees studying Mark's patent applications encouraged
- May commercialize if scientifically promising
- Foundation may partner on licensing (Mark and Foundation co-beneficiaries)

**Disclosure**:

- Applicants studying Mark's patent must disclose in application (not a conflict, just transparency)
- Foundation provides connections to Mark for collaboration

## Non-Compliance & Recovery

### Types of Non-Compliance

**Minor Non-Compliance** (addressed with correction):

- Late reports (<60 days)
- Missing acknowledgments in publications
- Budget overspending <10% without prior approval
- Incomplete documentation

**Major Non-Compliance** (serious, may trigger recovery):

- Late reports >90 days
- Falsified data or reports
- Unallowable expenditures (e.g., entertainment, alcohol)
- Misappropriation of funds (using for non-grant purposes)
- Failure to meet publication or data sharing requirements
- Breach of confidentiality or research ethics

**Research Misconduct**:

- Fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism
- Ethical violations (IRB violations, misconduct with human subjects)
- Financial fraud

### Remediation Process

**Step 1: Notification & Opportunity to Respond**

- Foundation sends written notice of non-compliance
- PI has 30 days to respond with explanation or corrective action plan

**Step 2: Corrective Action Plan**

- Foundation and PI agree on steps to remedy
- Timeline for completion (typically 30-90 days)
- Monitoring and check-ins

**Step 3: Resolution or Escalation**

- If corrected: Close matter, document in file
- If not corrected: Escalate to recovery process

### Recovery of Funds

**Trigger for Recovery**:

- Unallowable expenditures identified
- Misappropriation or fraud
- Failure to complete project without justification
- Repeated non-compliance despite remediation efforts

**Recovery Process**:

1. **Demand Letter**: Foundation sends formal demand for repayment
   - Amount to be recovered (with calculation)
   - Reason for recovery
   - 30-day deadline
2. **Institutional Negotiation**: Grants Manager works with institutional official to resolve
3. **Payment Plan** (if full repayment immediate hardship): Agree on installments
4. **Legal Action** (last resort, very rare): If institution refuses to repay

**Consequences**:

- PI and institution ineligible for future Foundation funding
- Report to other funders (if fraud or misconduct)
- Report to Office of Research Integrity (if federal funds involved)
