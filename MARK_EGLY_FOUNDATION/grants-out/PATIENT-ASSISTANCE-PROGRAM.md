## Philosophy & Mission Alignment

### Why Patient Assistance Matters

The Mark Egly Foundation's mission is to end diagnostic delays and improve outcomes for AATD patients. Financial barriers represent one of the most significant obstacles to achieving this mission:

**The Financial Burden of AATD:**

- **Genetic testing**: $200-$1,500 (often not covered by insurance)
- **Augmentation therapy**: $100,000-200,000 annually (with 20% co-pays = $20,000-$40,000 out of pocket)
- **Specialist visits**: Multiple pulmonologists, hepatologists, genetic counselors
- **Travel costs**: Patients in rural areas may travel 100+ miles to AATD specialists
- **Lost wages**: Time off for appointments, procedures, and illness
- **Emergency interventions**: Hospitalizations for exacerbations

**Without financial assistance:**

- Patients delay or skip genetic testing (remain undiagnosed)
- Patients cannot afford augmentation therapy (disease progression accelerates)
- Families face medical bankruptcy
- Health disparities widen (low-income patients suffer worse outcomes)

### Guiding Principles

**1. No Patient Left Behind**

- Financial circumstances should never prevent access to life-saving diagnosis and treatment
- Assistance is available to all qualifying patients regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or geography

**2. Dignity & Respect**

- Application process is streamlined and compassionate
- Patients are not required to share excessive personal financial details
- Assistance is provided confidentially without stigma

**3. Stewardship & Accountability**

- Foundation funds are used responsibly and transparently
- Assistance goes directly to medical costs (not redirected)
- Fraud prevention measures protect donor contributions
- Impact is measured and reported to stakeholders

**4. Collaboration, Not Duplication**

- Partner with pharmaceutical patient assistance programs (PAPs)
- Connect patients to all available resources (government programs, co-pay assistance, etc.)
- Fill gaps where other programs fall short

**5. Empowerment & Education**

- Teach patients to navigate the healthcare system
- Provide tools for self-advocacy
- Support long-term financial sustainability (not just one-time assistance)

- Coverage: Reimbursement support, financial assistance

### Foundation's Role: Filling the Gaps

**Gap 1: Patients Who Don't Qualify for PAPs**

- Income too high for free medication but still can't afford co-pays
- Medicare/Medicaid patients (PAPs often restricted)
- Patients between insurance coverage (job transition, COBRA gap)

**Foundation Assistance**: Bridge funding during coverage gaps

**Gap 2: Non-Medication Costs**

- Genetic testing (before therapy prescribed)
- Specialist visits to establish therapy need
- Monitoring tests (PFTs, liver function)
- Travel to infusion centers

**Foundation Assistance**: Comprehensive support beyond medication

**Gap 3: Multiple Simultaneous Expenses**

- Patient may receive free medication from PAP but still face:
  - Travel costs
  - Lost wages
  - Co-pays for monitoring visits
  - DME costs

**Foundation Assistance**: Holistic support for total cost of care

### Referral Partnership Process

**Step 1: Foundation Screens for PAP Eligibility**

- Every patient assistance applicant is assessed for PAP eligibility
- If eligible, Foundation refers to appropriate PAP first
- Provides application assistance if patient needs help

**Step 2: PAP Application Support**

- Foundation patient navigators help patients complete PAP applications
- Follow up to ensure applications processed
- Advocate for patients if applications denied

**Step 3: Foundation Assistance AFTER PAP**

- Patient must apply to relevant PAPs before Foundation assistance considered
- Foundation provides supplemental assistance for costs NOT covered by PAP
- OR provides assistance during PAP application processing time

**Step 4: Ongoing Coordination**

- Foundation communicates with PAPs to avoid duplication
- Shares resources and best practices
- Collaborates on patient success stories (with consent)

### Co-Pay Accumulator Program Challenges

**The Problem:**

- Insurance co-pay accumulator programs prevent manufacturer co-pay cards from counting toward deductible
- Patient receives co-pay assistance but still must pay full deductible
- Can result in $10,000+ out-of-pocket expenses despite "assistance"

**Foundation's Response:**

- Advocate against co-pay accumulator programs (policy work)
- Provide assistance to patients caught in accumulator programs
- Educate patients about accumulator risks when selecting insurance plans

## Fraud Prevention & Compliance

### Fraud Prevention Measures

**Application Verification:**

- [ ] Physician contact information verified (call office to confirm)
- [ ] Income documentation checked (pay stubs match employer, tax returns signed by CPA)
- [ ] Insurance cards verified (call insurer to confirm coverage)
- [ ] Medical necessity reviewed (symptoms consistent with diagnosis)
- [ ] Cross-check against previous applications (no duplicates)

**Red Flags for Fraud:**

- 🚩 Physician cannot be reached or doesn't know patient
- 🚩 Income documents appear altered or forged
- 🚩 Patient requests cash payment instead of provider payment
- 🚩 Multiple applications from same IP address with different names
- 🚩 Reluctance to provide documentation
- 🚩 Story changes between application and follow-up calls
- 🚩 Urgency pressure ("I need money today or I'll die")

**Investigation Process:**

1. Flag suspicious application (do not approve payment)
2. Request additional documentation
3. Conduct independent verification (call physician, check insurance)
4. If fraud suspected, consult legal counsel
5. Deny application and document reason
6. Report to law enforcement if criminal fraud suspected

**Consequences of Fraud:**

- Application denied
- Banned from future assistance (permanent)
- Required to repay any assistance received (civil action)
- Criminal prosecution if appropriate (theft by deception)
- Reported to other patient assistance programs (prevent serial fraud)

### Compliance with Federal Regulations

**Anti-Kickback Statute (Medicare/Medicaid):**

- Foundation CANNOT provide assistance to Medicare/Medicaid beneficiaries for co-pays
- Violates federal law (indirect inducement to use particular provider or product)
- Foundation may assist with non-covered services only (travel, testing not covered by Medicare)

**IRS Charitable Purpose Requirements:**

- Assistance must serve charitable purpose (helping needy individuals)
- Cannot primarily benefit private interests (drug companies, providers)
- Must assess financial need (can't give to wealthy individuals)
- Documentation requirements: Applications, approval records, payment records

**State Charitable Solicitation Laws:**

- Funds raised for patient assistance must be used for patient assistance (not general operating)
- Financial reports must separately account for patient assistance funds
- Donor restrictions honored (if donor specifies "for genetic testing," use only for that)

### Internal Controls

**Segregation of Duties:**

- Different staff members:
  - Review applications (Patient Services Coordinator)
  - Approve assistance (Program Manager/Director)
  - Process payments (Finance Department)
  - Reconcile accounts (Controller/CFO)

**Payment Controls:**

- Dual signature required for checks >$5,000
- Electronic payment approvals require two-factor authentication
- Monthly reconciliation of patient assistance fund
- Quarterly audit of random sample of applications

**Reporting:**

- Monthly dashboard to Executive Director (applications, approvals, denials, spending)
- Quarterly report to Board Finance Committee
- Annual audit by external CPA firm

## Success Stories & Testimonials

### Patient Story Example (Anonymized)

**Sarah's Story: From Diagnosis to Hope**

_"I coughed for 15 years before anyone tested me for Alpha-1. When I finally got diagnosed, I was relieved to have an answer—but terrified about the cost. The genetic testing alone was $800 out-of-pocket, and my doctor said I'd need weekly IV infusions costing thousands per month. I'm a single mom; there was no way I could afford it._

_Then my doctor told me about the Mark Egly Foundation. I was skeptical—I've never been good at asking for help—but I filled out the application. Within two weeks, they approved me for genetic testing assistance AND help with my therapy co-pays. They paid the lab directly for my test, and now they help cover $800/month of my infusion costs._

_For the first time in months, I can breathe—literally and figuratively. I'm not lying awake at night worrying about how to pay for my medication. My lung function is improving, and I can play with my kids again. This foundation gave me my life back."_

— Sarah M., Texas (Patient #042, Genetic Testing + Therapy Assistance, $12,200 total)
