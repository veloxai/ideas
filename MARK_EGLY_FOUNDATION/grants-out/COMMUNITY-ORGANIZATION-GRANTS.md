## Program Overview

### Mission

**The Mark Egly Foundation Community Organization Support Grants Program funds grassroots organizations to**:

- **Build AATD support groups** (local, regional, online)

### Program Philosophy

**Grassroots First**:

- Grants help professionalize and sustain
- Training and technical assistance (not just money)

**Collaboration Over Duplication**:

- Encourage partnerships (local groups + national organizations)
- Share best practices across grantees
- Build AATD community network

**Patient-Led, Patient-Focused**:

- Grants must be led by AATD patients or patient advocates
- Programs must serve AATD patients/families
- Patient voices drive strategy
