## Evaluation Criteria & Scoring

### Scoring Framework

**Overall Impact Score**: 1-9 scale (1 = exceptional, 9 = poor)
**Criterion Scores**: Each criterion scored separately, then weighted

### Criterion 1: Significance (30% weight)

**Key Questions**:

- Does the project address an important problem or critical barrier in AATD?
- Will it advance scientific knowledge, clinical practice, or patient outcomes?
- Is the problem of high priority for the AATD community?

**Scoring Guidance**:

- **1-3 (Exceptional to Excellent)**: Addresses critical gap, high potential for transformative impact
- **4-6 (Good to Fair)**: Addresses important question, incremental advance
- **7-9 (Poor)**: Marginal significance, unclear benefit to AATD patients

**Red Flags**:

- Research question already answered
- Unlikely to change practice or understanding
- Benefit to AATD patients unclear

### Criterion 2: Investigator(s) (20% weight)

**Key Questions**:

- Is the PI qualified to lead this research?
- Does the team have complementary expertise?
- Is there appropriate mentorship (for early-career investigators)?
- Does the track record suggest successful completion?

**Scoring Guidance**:

- **1-3**: Highly qualified, proven track record, excellent mentorship
- **4-6**: Qualified but limited experience, adequate mentorship
- **7-9**: Insufficient qualifications, poor track record, inadequate support

**Red Flags**:

- PI has never published in AATD or related field
- Early-career applicant without strong mentor
- Team lacks critical expertise (e.g., biostatistician for clinical trial)

### Criterion 3: Innovation (15% weight)

**Key Questions**:

- Is the approach novel, or a refinement/improvement?
- Does it challenge current paradigms or develop new methods?
- Are the concepts, approaches, or methods cutting-edge?

**Scoring Guidance**:

- **1-3**: Highly innovative, paradigm-shifting potential
- **4-6**: Some novel elements, incremental innovation
- **7-9**: Not innovative, routine application of existing methods

**Note**: Lack of innovation doesn't automatically disqualify; significance may outweigh innovation.

### Criterion 4: Approach (25% weight)

**Key Questions**:

- Are the methods scientifically rigorous?
- Is the study design appropriate to test the hypothesis?
- Are potential problems anticipated with mitigation strategies?
- Is the timeline realistic?
- Are statistical methods sound (power, analysis plan)?

**Scoring Guidance**:

- **1-3**: Rigorous design, well-justified methods, thoughtful contingency plans
- **4-6**: Generally sound but some weaknesses, limited contingency planning
- **7-9**: Significant methodological flaws, underpowered, unrealistic timeline

**Red Flags**:

- Underpowered study (insufficient sample size)
- Critical methodological details missing
- No contingency plans for likely problems
- Timeline shows all aims in parallel without dependencies (suggests lack of thought)

### Criterion 5: Environment (10% weight)

**Key Questions**:

- Does the institution provide adequate resources?
- Is there access to necessary patient populations, samples, or facilities?
- Are collaborations appropriate and supported?

**Scoring Guidance**:

- **1-3**: Excellent resources, ideal environment, strong institutional support
- **4-6**: Adequate resources, some limitations but workable
- **7-9**: Insufficient resources, lack of patient access, weak institutional support

### Scoring Meeting Process

**Pre-Meeting (Weeks 1-4 after deadline)**:

- Each application assigned to 3 reviewers (1 SAC member, 2 external experts)

  - Summary of project
  - Review of scores (Significance, Investigator, Innovation, Approach, Environment)
  - Strengths (bulleted list)
  - Weaknesses (bulleted list)
  - Overall assessment and recommendation

- **Step 2**: Discussion (10-15 min)
  - Other reviewers add perspectives
  - Committee asks questions
  - Focus on resolving score discrepancies
  - Discuss funding priority

- **Step 3**: Final scoring (5 min)
  - Reviewers may adjust scores based on discussion
  - Committee votes on funding recommendation:
    - **Fund as proposed**
    - **Fund with modifications** (specify budget cuts or scope changes)
    - **Defer** (revise and resubmit next cycle)
    - **Do not fund**

**Output**: Ranked list of applications with scores and funding recommendations

---

## Conflict of Interest Management

### Definition of Conflict

A reviewer has a conflict of interest if:

- ✅ **Collaboration**: Co-author on publication with PI in last 3 years
- ✅ **Mentorship**: Current or former mentor/mentee relationship
- ✅ **Institutional**: Same department or close collaboration at same institution
- ✅ **Financial**: Stock ownership, consulting fees, licensing agreements related to PI's work
- ✅ **Personal**: Family relationship, close personal friendship
- ✅ **Competitive**: Direct competitor (studying same question with same approach)
- ✅ **Bias**: Personal animosity or strong negative history with PI

### Disclosure Requirements

**Pre-Review**:

- All reviewers complete COI form for each assigned application
- Form asks about all categories above
- Submitted via portal before accessing application

**During Review**:

- If conflict discovered after starting review, immediately notify Grants Manager
- Reassignment to different reviewer

**At Meeting**:

- SAC members declare conflicts before each application discussion
- Conflicted member excuses self from room/call during discussion and voting

### Managing Identified Conflicts

**Minor Conflicts** (e.g., same institution but no direct interaction):

- Reviewer may continue but must disclose in critique
- Extra scrutiny by Grants Manager to ensure objectivity

**Major Conflicts** (e.g., close collaborator):

- Reviewer recused entirely
- Application reassigned to non-conflicted reviewer
- Conflicted reviewer may not discuss application informally with other reviewers

**Foundation Staff/Board Conflicts**:

- Board members and staff cannot apply for grants
- Family members may apply but relationship disclosed publicly
- Extra layer of review (external ethics board if needed)

## Selection & Award Decisions

### Funding Thresholds

**Priority Scores** (calculated from criterion scores):

- **1.0-2.0**: Exceptional, strong funding priority
- **2.1-3.5**: Excellent, likely funded if budget allows
- **3.6-5.0**: Good, competitive but may not be funded
- **5.1-7.0**: Fair to poor, unlikely to be funded
- **7.1-9.0**: Not competitive

**Funding Line** (varies by year based on available budget):

- Typically falls at priority score ~3.5-4.0
- Applications above line automatically funded
- Applications near line discussed for funding considerations

### Board of Directors Role

**Board Reviews**:

- SAC recommendations and ranked list
- Budget implications (total grant spending for year)
- Portfolio balance considerations (see below)
- Strategic alignment with Foundation priorities

**Board Authority**:

- Final approval of all grants
- May ask SAC to reconsider specific applications
- Rarely overturns SAC recommendations (maintains scientific integrity)

**Board Meeting**: Late July, decisions announced August 1

### Portfolio Balance Considerations

**Foundation Seeks Diversity Across**:

**1. Research Pillars**:

- Ensure funding across all four pillars (not all in therapeutics, for example)
- Target distribution: Diagnosis 30%, Therapeutics 35%, Natural History 20%, QOL 15%

**2. Career Stages**:

- Support pipeline of early-career researchers
- Balance established investigators and new investigators

**3. Institutions**:

- Not all grants to top 10 universities
- Geographic diversity (not all East Coast, for example)
- Include community hospitals and smaller institutions

**4. Methodologies**:

- Mix of basic science, clinical research, translational, health services research
- Different approaches (RCTs, observational, lab-based, computational)

**5. Demographics**:

- Support researchers from underrepresented backgrounds
- Institutions serving diverse patient populations

**Decision Rule**:

- If two applications have similar priority scores, portfolio balance may tip decision
- Lower-scored application may be funded if fills critical gap in portfolio
