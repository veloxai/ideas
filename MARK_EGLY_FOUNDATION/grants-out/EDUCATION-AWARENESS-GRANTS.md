## Program Overview

### Mission

**The Mark Egly Foundation Education & Awareness Grants Program funds initiatives to**:

- **Educate healthcare providers** (reduce diagnostic delay through better provider awareness)
- **Empower patients** (knowledge is power—help patients navigate AATD)
- **Raise public awareness** (AATD is rare, but not that rare—300K+ undiagnosed)
- **Eliminate stigma** (lung disease isn't always smoking-related)

**Education is the fastest path to reducing diagnostic delays.**

---

### Program Philosophy

**Provider Education First**:

- Providers (especially PCPs, pulmonologists) are gatekeepers to diagnosis
- If providers don't think of AATD, patients don't get tested
- CME-accredited education is investment in early diagnosis

**Patient-Centric Materials**:

- Written in plain language (no jargon)
- Culturally appropriate (diverse audiences)
- Accessible (multiple formats—print, video, audio)
- Actionable (what can patients DO with this info?)

**Community-Based Approach**:

- Partner with trusted community organizations
- Meet people where they are (health fairs, churches, community centers)
- Grassroots engagement (not top-down)

**Measurable Impact**:

- Every education grant must have clear outcomes
- Track reach (# people educated), behavior change (# tested), diagnoses (# found)
