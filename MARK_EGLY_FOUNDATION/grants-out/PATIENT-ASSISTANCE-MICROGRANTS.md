## Program Overview

### Mission

**The Mark Egly Foundation Patient Assistance Microgrants Program provides direct financial assistance to AATD patients for**:

- **Diagnostic testing** (AAT blood test, genetic testing, travel to specialist)
- **Emergency assistance** (utility bills, rent, medical bills during crisis)
- **Treatment access** (copays, medications, equipment)
- **Quality of life** (pulmonary rehab, mental health counseling, support group travel)

**Because no patient should face financial barriers to AATD diagnosis or care.**

---

### Program Philosophy

**Direct Patient Impact**:

- Money goes directly to patients (or paid to providers on behalf of patients)
- Fast turnaround (application to decision in 7-14 days)
- No bureaucracy (simple application, minimal paperwork)

**Meet Patients Where They Are**:

- Financial hardship is common in AATD (medical costs, lost work, disability)
- Many patients live paycheck to paycheck
- Small amounts ($500-$2,000) can make big difference

**Focus on Diagnosis + Crisis**:

- Priority: Help undiagnosed people get tested
- Priority: Emergency assistance (prevent eviction, keep lights on)
- Priority: Treatment access (copays for augmentation therapy)

**Dignity and Respect**:

- No judgment (everyone deserves help)
- Privacy protected (confidential process)
- Patient-centered (what does the patient need?)
