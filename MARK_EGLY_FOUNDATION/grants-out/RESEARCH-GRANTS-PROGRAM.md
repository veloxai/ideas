## Program Overview

### Mission

**The Mark Egly Foundation Research Grants Program funds innovative AATD research to**:

- **Accelerate diagnosis** (reduce 7-8 year diagnostic delay)
- **Improve patient outcomes** (treatments, quality of life)
- **Advance scientific understanding** (genetics, pathophysiology, epidemiology)
- **Develop new tools** (diagnostics, therapeutics, devices)

**We prioritize research that directly impacts patients.**

---

### Program Philosophy

**Patient-Centered Research**:

- Research must have clear path to patient benefit (diagnosis, treatment, quality of life)
- Patient perspectives incorporated in research design
- Results communicated to patients in accessible language

**High-Risk, High-Reward**:

- Fund early-stage, innovative ideas (not yet ready for NIH)
- Support "moonshot" projects that could transform AATD care
- Accept that some projects will fail (that's science)

**Collaboration Over Competition**:

- Encourage multi-institutional partnerships
- Require data sharing (with appropriate patient protections)
- Foster AATD research community

**Speed to Impact**:

- Quick review cycles (60-90 days vs. 6-12 months for NIH)
- Minimal bureaucracy
- Interim results inform next funding decisions

---

## Research Priorities

### Priority 1: Diagnostic Acceleration 🔥

**Goal**: Cut diagnostic delay from 7-8 years to 3-4 years by 2030

**Research Topics**:

- **Point-of-care testing** (AAT glucometer, rapid diagnostic devices)
- **AI-driven diagnosis** (machine learning to flag AATD risk from EHR data)
- **Biomarker discovery** (new markers beyond AAT level)
- **Screening strategies** (optimal populations, cost-effectiveness)
- **Provider education impact** (does CME reduce diagnostic delay?)

**Why This Matters**:

- Diagnostic delay is #1 problem for AATD patients
- Mark's personal mission (7-8 years to diagnose himself)
- Foundation's north star metric (Diagnostic Delay Time)

**Funding Allocation**: 40-50% of research budget

---

### Priority 2: Treatment Innovation

**Goal**: Expand treatment options beyond augmentation therapy

**Research Topics**:

- **Novel therapeutics** (gene therapy, CRISPR, small molecules)
- **Augmentation therapy optimization** (dosing, delivery, personalized medicine)
- **Lung-protective strategies** (prevent emphysema progression)
- **Liver disease treatments** (AATD liver disease underserved)
- **Drug repurposing** (existing drugs for AATD)

**Why This Matters**:

- Current treatment (augmentation therapy) expensive, burdensome (weekly infusions)
- No cure exists
- Many patients not eligible for augmentation therapy

**Funding Allocation**: 25-30% of research budget

---

### Priority 3: Quality of Life & Patient Outcomes

**Goal**: Improve day-to-day life for AATD patients

**Research Topics**:

- **Psychosocial impact** (anxiety, depression, quality of life)
- **Exercise interventions** (pulmonary rehab, optimal exercise for AATD)
- **Patient navigation** (does navigation improve outcomes?)
- **Symptom management** (breathlessness, fatigue, exacerbations)
- **Caregiver burden** (support for families)

**Why This Matters**:

- AATD affects every aspect of life (physical, emotional, social, financial)
- Research often focuses on biology, not lived experience
- Patients want better quality of life, not just longer life

**Funding Allocation**: 15-20% of research budget

---

### Priority 4: Epidemiology & Health Disparities

**Goal**: Understand who gets diagnosed, who doesn't, and why

**Research Topics**:

- **Diagnostic delay disparities** (race, ethnicity, geography, insurance status)
- **Underdiagnosed populations** (why are certain groups missed?)
- **Natural history studies** (long-term outcomes for diagnosed vs. undiagnosed)
- **Healthcare utilization** (ER visits, hospitalizations, costs)
- **Screening uptake** (barriers to testing)

**Why This Matters**:

- Only 10% of AATD patients diagnosed (90% undiagnosed)
- Health disparities likely (not all patients have equal access)
- Understanding "who, when, why" improves detection strategies

**Funding Allocation**: 10-15% of research budget

---
