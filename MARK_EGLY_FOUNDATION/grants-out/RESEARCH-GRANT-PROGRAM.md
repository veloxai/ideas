## Program Philosophy & Mission

### Why Fund AATD Research?

Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) is an **orphan disease** affecting approximately 100,000-200,000 individuals in the United States and 1-2 million worldwide. As a rare disease, AATD research is chronically **underfunded**:

**The Funding Gap:**
- **NIH AATD research funding**: ~$15-20 million annually (across all AATD research)
- **Compare to**: Cystic Fibrosis receives ~$100+ million annually despite similar prevalence
- **Pharmaceutical investment**: Limited to augmentation therapy optimization (existing treatment), minimal investment in novel therapies
- **Academic funding**: Difficult to secure grants for rare disease research (limited patient populations, small datasets)

**Consequences of Underfunding:**
- 7-8 year average diagnostic delay (lack of awareness research)
- No cure (only symptomatic management with augmentation therapy)
- Limited understanding of MZ carrier risks (most research focuses on ZZ)
- Insufficient data on liver disease progression
- Few clinical trials for novel therapeutics

### Mark Egly Foundation's Role

The Foundation serves as a **catalyst for innovation** by:

1. **Filling Early-Stage Funding Gaps**: Support pilot studies and preliminary data collection that enable researchers to secure larger NIH or industry grants
2. **High-Risk, High-Reward Research**: Fund innovative approaches that traditional funders consider too risky
3. **Patient-Centered Research**: Prioritize studies that directly improve patient outcomes (diagnosis, treatment, quality of life)
4. **Building Research Capacity**: Support early-career investigators to develop AATD expertise
5. **Accelerating Translation**: Move discoveries from bench to bedside faster

**Not Competing, Complementing:**
- We don't replace NIH or pharmaceutical research
- We complement by funding areas they overlook
- We de-risk projects to attract larger follow-on funding

### Guiding Principles

**1. Impact Over Prestige**
- Evaluate proposals based on potential patient benefit, not institutional reputation
- Welcome applications from community hospitals and small research institutions
- Value translational research (applicable to patients) as highly as basic science

**2. Collaboration & Transparency**
- Require data sharing to accelerate field-wide progress
- Encourage multi-center collaborations
- Publish all funded research (open access preferred)
- Connect researchers with Foundation's patient registry and biobank

**3. Equity & Inclusion**
- Prioritize research addressing health disparities in AATD
- Support researchers from underrepresented backgrounds
- Include patient and caregiver voices in research design

**4. Accountability & Rigor**
- Peer-reviewed selection process
- Clear milestones and deliverables
- Transparent reporting of results (positive and negative)
- Efficient use of limited resources

## Research Priorities & Focus Areas

### Foundation Research Agenda (Updated Annually)

The Mark Egly Foundation prioritizes research in four strategic pillars:

---

### Pillar 1: Diagnosis & Screening (30% of research budget)

**Goal**: Reduce average diagnostic delay from 7-8 years to <1 year

**Priority Topics:**
1. **Point-of-Care Testing**: Develop rapid, low-cost AAT screening devices (Mark's "glucometer" concept)
2. **Clinical Decision Support**: AI/ML tools to identify AATD candidates from EHR data
3. **Newborn Screening**: Validate screening methodologies and model policy impact
4. **Provider Education Research**: Evaluate CME interventions to increase testing rates
5. **Diagnostic Pathways**: Study optimal algorithms for AATD diagnosis in different clinical scenarios

**Example Funded Projects:**
- Development of lateral flow assay for AAT quantification ($50,000, 2 years)
- NLP tool to flag "undiagnosed AATD" in COPD patients' medical records ($75,000, 2 years)
- Pilot newborn screening program in 3 states with outcomes tracking ($100,000, 3 years)

---

### Pillar 2: Novel Therapeutics & Treatment Optimization (35% of research budget)

**Goal**: Identify new treatments and optimize existing therapies

**Priority Topics:**
1. **Augmentation Therapy Optimization**: Dosing, frequency, delivery methods
2. **Alternative Therapies**: Small molecules, gene therapy, stem cell approaches
3. **Liver Disease Treatments**: Therapies to prevent/reverse liver damage from AAT aggregation
4. **Repurposing Research**: Investigate Mark Egly's patent (repurposed AAT protein) for firefighters, military, asthma
5. **Combination Therapies**: Augmentation therapy + anti-inflammatory or antioxidant agents

**Example Funded Projects:**
- Phase I trial of inhaled AAT for lung-specific delivery ($150,000, 3 years)
- Study of antioxidant supplementation + augmentation therapy ($60,000, 2 years)
- In vitro study of gene editing (CRISPR) to correct SERPINA1 mutation ($40,000, 1 year)

---

### Pillar 3: Natural History & Disease Progression (20% of research budget)

**Goal**: Understand how AATD progresses and identify predictive biomarkers

**Priority Topics:**
1. **MZ Carrier Research**: Quantify disease risk in heterozygotes (one mutated gene)
2. **Liver Disease Progression**: Longitudinal studies of hepatic manifestations
3. **Biomarker Discovery**: Identify blood, imaging, or genetic markers of disease progression
4. **Environmental Factors**: Study impact of smoke, pollution, occupational exposures
5. **Pediatric AATD**: Natural history in children (early intervention opportunities)

**Example Funded Projects:**
- Longitudinal cohort study of 500 MZ carriers tracked for 10 years ($100,000, Foundation contribution to multi-site study)
- Metabolomics study to identify progression biomarkers ($75,000, 2 years)
- Analysis of occupational exposures in AATD patients (firefighters, military) ($50,000, 18 months)

---

### Pillar 4: Quality of Life & Patient-Reported Outcomes (15% of research budget)

**Goal**: Improve lived experience of AATD patients beyond clinical measures

**Priority Topics:**
1. **Psychosocial Impact**: Anxiety, depression, caregiver burden
2. **Exercise & Rehabilitation**: Pulmonary rehab effectiveness in AATD
3. **Nutritional Interventions**: Diet and supplementation for AATD management
4. **Telehealth & Remote Monitoring**: Digital health interventions
5. **Health Equity**: Disparities in access, outcomes, and quality of life

**Example Funded Projects:**
- RCT of telehealth pulmonary rehab vs. in-person for AATD patients ($80,000, 2 years)
- Mixed-methods study of diagnostic odyssey psychological impact ($45,000, 18 months)

## Conclusion

The Mark Egly Foundation Research Grant Program is designed to accelerate scientific discoveries that will improve the lives of AATD patients. By funding innovative, high-impact research across the spectrum from diagnosis to treatment to quality of life, we aim to transform AATD from a rare, often-overlooked disease to a well-understood, effectively managed condition.

**Our Commitment:**
- Fund the best science, regardless of institutional prestige
- Support researchers at all career stages
- Promote collaboration, transparency, and data sharing
- Measure impact by patient benefit, not just publications
- Build a vibrant, connected AATD research community

**Call to Action:**
If you are a researcher interested in AATD, we encourage you to apply. If you are a patient or donor who wants to support life-changing research, consider contributing to our research fund. Together, we can end diagnostic delays, develop better treatments, and ultimately cure AATD.
