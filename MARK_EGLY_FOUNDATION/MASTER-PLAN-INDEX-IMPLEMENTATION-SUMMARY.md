## Master Plan Overview

### The Vision

**Mission**: Increase Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) diagnosis rate from 10% to 50%, accelerate research toward a cure, and improve lives of all AATD patients and families.

**Named in Honor**: Mark Egly—passionate AATD advocate, community builder, and inspiration for this foundation's patient-centered approach.

**Strategic Horizon**: 10-year roadmap (2025-2035) with 5-year detailed plans across 5 strategic phases.

---

---

### Why This Matters

**Current State of AATD**:

- 100,000 Americans have severe AATD (Pi\*ZZ genotype)
- Only 10,000 diagnosed (90% undiagnosed—living with "asthma," "COPD," untreated)
- Average diagnostic delay: 5-7 years, 3-4 misdiagnoses
- No cure (only augmentation therapy—slows progression, doesn't reverse damage)

**Mark Egly Foundation Will Change This**:

- **Diagnosis**: Partner with 23andMe, Invitae (genetic testing—screen 1M+ people, identify 5,000+ new AATD patients by Year 5)
- **Research**: Build 10,000-patient registry (world's largest—accelerate gene therapy trials, cure within 10-15 years)
- **Support**: Serve 500 patients Year 1 → 10,000 by Year 10 (support groups, patient navigation, financial assistance)
- **Advocacy**: Policy change (newborn screening, insurance coverage—systemic impact)

---

## Document Interdependencies

### Critical Path Dependencies (Must Complete in Order)

**Legal Before Everything**:

- Articles of Incorporation → Bylaws → 501(c)(3) Application → (wait 6 months) → 501(c)(3) Approval → Can issue tax-deductible receipts

**Governance Before Programs**:

- Bylaws → Board Governance Policies → Board recruits → Scientific Advisory Board Charter → SAB recruits → Research Grant Program launches
- (Can't give research grants without SAB to review—scientific credibility)

**Infrastructure Before Data Collection**:

- HIPAA Compliance Program → Data Privacy & Security Policies → Patient Registry Design → Registry Launch
- (Can't collect patient data without HIPAA compliance—legal requirement)

**Fundraising Before Scaling**:

- Individual Giving Program (Year 1) → Major Gifts Program (Year 2) → Foundation Grants (Year 2-3) → Registry Monetization (Year 3-5)
- (Need $500K-$1M/year revenue before can afford registry infrastructure $1M+)

---

### Parallel Opportunities (Can Execute Simultaneously)

**Year 1 Parallelization**:

- ✅ Peer Support Groups + Patient Navigation + Welcome Packet (all patient services—different staff, no conflict)
- ✅ Individual Giving + Online Fundraising (donor cultivation happens while digital campaigns run)
- ✅ Website Redesign + Content Strategy (web developer builds site while content writer drafts articles)

**Year 2-3 Parallelization**:

- ✅ Registry Recruitment + Research Grant Awards (registry grows while funded researchers publish)
- ✅ Gala + Endurance Events + Golf Tournament (different event committees, spread across quarters)
- ✅ Physician Education + Patient Conference (different audiences, complementary)

---

### Synergistic Clusters (Documents That Amplify Each Other)

**Cluster 1: Diagnosis Acceleration**:

- Genetic Testing Partnerships (23andMe screens) → Genetic Counseling Program (counsel positives) → Patient Navigation (enroll in care) → Patient Registry (collect data) → Research (study newly diagnosed)
- **Synergy**: Each step feeds next—1M screened → 5K diagnosed → 3K enroll registry → research accelerates

**Cluster 2: Research Flywheel**:

- Patient Registry → Biobank → Research Grants → Publications → Registry Credibility → Pharma Partnerships → Registry Revenue → More Research Grants
- **Synergy**: Virtuous cycle—better registry → more research → better registry

**Cluster 3: Patient Journey**:

- Newly Diagnosed Welcome Packet → Peer Support Groups → Patient Navigation → Annual Conference → Patient Advisory Board (veteran patients) → Volunteer Program (give back)
- **Synergy**: Patients progress from "scared, newly diagnosed" → "supported, educated" → "advocates, leaders"

## Risk Matrix

### HIGH RISK (Mitigate Aggressively)

**Risk 1: 501(c)(3) Application Denied**

- **Impact**: Can't issue tax-deductible receipts—fundraising crippled, donors won't give
- **Likelihood**: Low (5%—well-structured application, attorney-drafted)
- **Mitigation**: Hire experienced nonprofit attorney ($10K—worth every penny), submit complete application, respond promptly to IRS questions
- **Contingency**: If denied—appeal (90% success rate on appeal), or operate as 501(c)(4) social welfare org (less preferred but viable)

**Risk 2: Data Breach (Patient Registry Hacked)**

- **Impact**: HIPAA violation ($50K fine/record—potential $50M if 1,000 patients), reputation destroyed, registry collapses
- **Likelihood**: Low-Moderate (10%—healthcare = prime target for hackers)
- **Mitigation**: Cyber liability insurance ($2M coverage, $20K/year), penetration testing (annual, $15K), encryption (AES-256, data at rest + in transit), staff training (phishing simulations quarterly)
- **Contingency**: Incident response plan (forensics firm on retainer, notify patients <72 hours, offer credit monitoring, public transparency)

**Risk 3: Executive Director Departure (Year 1-2)**

- **Impact**: Loss of institutional knowledge, donor relationships, momentum stalls
- **Likelihood**: Moderate (20%—startup nonprofits = high turnover, burnout)
- **Mitigation**: Competitive comp ($120K + benefits—above sector median), strong Board support (monthly meetings, not micromanaging), clear succession plan (COO cross-trained)
- **Contingency**: Interim ED (Board member steps in 3-6 months), national search (6 months), maintain continuity via COO

---

### MEDIUM RISK (Monitor & Manage)

**Risk 4: Pharma Partnership Fails to Materialize**

- **Impact**: Revenue shortfall ($500K-$1M/year—delay registry expansion, biobank)
- **Likelihood**: Moderate (30%—pharma priorities shift, budget cuts)
- **Mitigation**: Diversify (3-5 pharma partners, not 1—no single point of failure), contract multi-year (lock in commitments), deliver value (demonstrate ROI—pharma renews)
- **Contingency**: Foundation grants (NEA, RRF—alternative funding), registry monetization (academic customers—smaller checks, but more of them)

**Risk 5: Low Registry Enrollment (<500 Year 1)**

- **Impact**: Research plans delayed, pharma partnerships less attractive (need 1,000+ patients to interest them)
- **Likelihood**: Moderate (30%—patient recruitment always challenging)
- **Mitigation**: Multi-channel recruitment (patient orgs, pulmonologists, genetic testing partners—not just one source), incentives ($50 gift card, altruism messaging, trial recruitment priority), simplify enrollment (online portal, 10 minutes)
- **Contingency**: Extend timeline (2 years to 1,000 patients instead of 1 year—slower but acceptable), partner with AlphaNet (share registry—collaborative not competitive)

---

### LOW RISK (Accept & Monitor)

**Risk 6: Event Revenue Underperforms**

- **Impact**: Shortfall $100K-$200K/year (planned gala nets $200K, actual nets $100K)
- **Likelihood**: Moderate (40%—events = volatile, economy-dependent)
- **Mitigation**: Conservative budgeting (budget 70% of goal—exceed expectations), multiple events (5 events = diversification, not 1 gala), corporate sponsorships (pre-sell $100K—guaranteed revenue)
- **Contingency**: Online fundraising surge (Giving Tuesday, Rare Disease Day—offset event shortfall)

**Risk 7: Competitive Landscape (AlphaNet, Alpha-1 Foundation Scale)**

- **Impact**: Donor confusion ("Which Alpha-1 org do I give to?"), market share loss
- **Likelihood**: Low-Moderate (20%—existing orgs may expand, but Foundation differentiates)
- **Mitigation**: Clear positioning ("Mark Egly Foundation = research + diagnosis acceleration, AlphaNet = care management, Alpha-1 Foundation = advocacy"—different niches), collaboration (joint programs—expand pie, not fight over slices)
- **Contingency**: Merger discussions (if competition becomes destructive—consider merging registries, combining strengths, serve community better)
