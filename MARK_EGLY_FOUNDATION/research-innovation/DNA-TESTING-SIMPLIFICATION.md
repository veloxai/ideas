## Overview

### The Testing Problem

**AATD diagnosis requires TWO tests**:

1. **AAT Level Test** (serum)—measures circulating Alpha-1 Antitrypsin protein (identifies deficiency)
2. **Genetic Test** (DNA)—confirms genotype (ZZ, MZ, MS, rare variants—determines severity, inheritance)

**Current Reality**:

- Only 25% of suspected AATD patients complete BOTH tests (75% stop after AAT level—don't get genetic confirmation)
- Genetic test costs $200-$1,000 (insurance coverage variable)
- Requires separate lab visit (another needle stick, more waiting)
- Results take 2-4 weeks (patients lose motivation)
- Limited access (rural patients, uninsured, international)

**Result**: 300,000+ Americans undiagnosed (have AATD but never confirmed genetically)

---

### Vision: Make AATD Testing as Easy as 23andMe

**Goals**:

- ✅ **One Test**: AAT level + genetics in single sample (no separate genetic test needed)
- ✅ **At-Home**: Mail-in kit (spit or finger prick—no clinic visit)
- ✅ **Affordable**: $50-$100 (insurance reimbursed, or Foundation subsidizes)
- ✅ **Fast**: Results in 1-2 weeks (vs. 4-6 weeks current process)
- ✅ **Accessible**: Available nationwide (rural, uninsured, international)
- ✅ **Actionable**: Results include next steps (referral to specialist, genetic counseling, Foundation resources)

**Impact**: 10x increase in genetic testing completion (250K→2.5M tests over 10 years)

---

## Current Testing Landscape

### Standard AATD Genetic Testing Process

**Step 1: Abnormal AAT Level**:

- Patient has low AAT level (<90 mg/dL—suggests deficiency)
- Doctor orders genetic test (SERPINA1 gene sequencing)

**Step 2: Genetic Test Order**:

- Doctor completes lab requisition (Quest, LabCorp, specialty labs like ARUP, Mayo)
- Specifies test type:
  - **Targeted genotyping** ($200-$400—tests only common variants: S, Z)
  - **Full gene sequencing** ($500-$1,000—identifies rare variants)

**Step 3: Patient Sample Collection**:

- Patient returns to lab (another appointment)
- Blood draw (venipuncture—5-10 mL)
- Sample shipped to lab (sometimes sent to specialty lab—adds time)

**Step 4: Lab Processing**:

- **PCR-based genotyping** (2-3 days—for common variants)
- **Sanger sequencing** (1-2 weeks—for full gene)
- **Next-gen sequencing** (NGS—1-2 weeks, more comprehensive)

**Step 5: Results & Follow-Up**:

- Results sent to doctor (2-4 weeks total)
- Doctor calls patient (discuss results, next steps)
- If confirmed AATD (ZZ, SZ, rare null variants) → refer to pulmonologist, genetic counseling

**Total Time**: 4-6 weeks (from AAT level to genetic confirmation)

---

### Who Offers AATD Genetic Testing (Current Market)

**Clinical Labs**:

- Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp (national labs—targeted genotyping)
- ARUP Laboratories (University of Utah—full sequencing, rare variants)
- Mayo Clinic Laboratories (comprehensive testing)
- GeneDx, Invitae (specialty genetic testing companies)

**Research Programs**:

- Alpha-1 Foundation (free testing program—research-focused, requires consent to use data)
- University research studies (free testing, but limited availability)

**Direct-to-Consumer** (Limited):

- 23andMe includes some AATD variants (S, Z—but not comprehensive, many false negatives)
- Not widely used for clinical diagnosis (doctors don't trust results)

---

## Barriers to Testing

### 1. Cost Barrier

**Problem**:

- Genetic test costs $200-$1,000 (varies by lab, test type)
- Insurance coverage variable (some plans cover 100%, others deny or high copay)
- Uninsured patients pay full price (can't afford—skip test)

**Impact**: 30% of patients cite cost as reason for not completing genetic test

---

### 2. Access Barrier

**Problem**:

- Requires lab visit (blood draw—not all clinics offer, rural patients travel 50+ miles)
- Not available internationally (many countries lack AATD testing infrastructure)
- Doctor must order (some won't—low awareness, think it's unnecessary)

**Impact**: 20% of patients can't access testing (rural, international, doctor refusal)

---

### 3. Complexity Barrier

**Problem**:

- Two-step process (AAT level, then genetic test—patients lose motivation between steps)
- Different labs (sometimes AAT level done at Quest, genetic test sent to ARUP—confusing)
- Delayed results (4-6 weeks—patients forget, don't follow up)

**Impact**: 25% of patients with abnormal AAT level never complete genetic test (lost to follow-up)

---

### 4. Awareness Barrier

**Problem**:

- Patients don't know genetic testing needed (doctor says "Your AAT is low, you have AATD"—patient thinks they're done)
- Family members don't test (patient diagnosed, but siblings, children not screened—genetic cascade testing rare)
- Carriers not prioritized (MZ, MS patients dismissed—"You're just a carrier, no big deal"—but new research shows health risks)

**Impact**: Only 10% of at-risk family members get tested (should be 100%)

---

## Simplification Strategies

### Strategy 1: Combined AAT + Genetic Testing (Single Sample)

**Concept**: One blood draw → both AAT level AND genetic test (results together)

**How**:

- Lab processes sample for AAT level (nephelometry or immunoassay)
- Same sample used for genetic testing (DNA extraction, sequencing)
- Results reported together (e.g., "AAT level: 45 mg/dL, Genotype: ZZ")

**Benefits**:

- ✅ Patient convenience (one lab visit, not two)
- ✅ Higher completion (no drop-off between tests)
- ✅ Faster results (processed in parallel—2-3 weeks total vs. 4-6 weeks)

**Barriers**:

- Lab workflow (some labs don't offer both tests—need partnership with full-service lab)
- Cost (genetic test still $200-$1,000—cost barrier remains)

**Foundation Action**:

- Partner with lab (e.g., Invitae, GeneDx—negotiate bundled pricing, promote to doctors)
- Educate doctors ("Order both tests upfront—saves time, improves patient compliance")

---

### Strategy 2: At-Home Genetic Testing Kit

**Concept**: Mail-in kit (like 23andMe)—patient orders online, spits or pricks finger, mails sample, gets results online

**How**:

- Foundation partners with DTC genetics company (Invitae, Color Genomics, 23andMe)
- Patient orders kit ($100—Foundation subsidizes if uninsured)
- Sample collection at home (saliva or finger prick—no clinic visit)
- Ship to lab (pre-paid envelope)
- Results in 2-3 weeks (online portal + genetic counseling included)

**Benefits**:

- ✅ Accessible (no clinic visit—rural, international patients can test)
- ✅ Convenient (do at home, on your schedule)
- ✅ Affordable (partner negotiates pricing—$50-$100 vs. $500+)
- ✅ Genetic counseling included (results explained by counselor—not just raw data)

**Barriers**:

- Sample quality (saliva or finger prick less reliable than venous blood—but acceptable for genetic testing)
- Doctor acceptance (some doctors don't trust DTC tests—need education)
- State regulations (NY, NJ restrict DTC testing—need workarounds)

**Foundation Action**:

- Launch at-home testing program (Year 2—see detailed plan below)

---

### Strategy 3: Free Testing for Uninsured/Low-Income

**Concept**: Foundation pays for genetic testing (for patients who can't afford)

**How**:

- Patient applies (online form—income verification, proof of abnormal AAT level)
- Foundation approves (income <200% FPL—~$60K family of 4)
- Foundation pays lab directly ($200-$400—negotiated rate with partner lab)
- Patient gets free testing

**Benefits**:

- ✅ Removes cost barrier (100% coverage for low-income patients)
- ✅ Health equity (ensure all patients diagnosed, regardless of ability to pay)

**Year 1 Budget**: $100K (subsidize 250-500 tests)

**Year 3 Budget**: $500K (subsidize 1,250-2,500 tests)

---

### Strategy 4: Genetic Cascade Testing Program

**Concept**: Once patient diagnosed, test ALL first-degree relatives (siblings, children, parents)

**How**:

- Proband (diagnosed patient) consults genetic counselor (Foundation-funded)
- Counselor creates family tree (identify at-risk relatives)
- Foundation offers free testing (first-degree relatives—50% chance of being carrier or affected)
- Results reported with genetic counseling (explain risk, next steps)

**Benefits**:

- ✅ Early diagnosis (catch AATD before symptoms—start treatment early)
- ✅ Family planning (carriers know risk for future children)
- ✅ Exponential reach (1 diagnosis → 5-10 relatives tested → 2-3 more cases found per family)

**Year 1 Goal**: 100 families (500 relatives tested, 50 new diagnoses expected)

**Year 3 Goal**: 500 families (2,500 relatives tested, 250 new diagnoses)

---

## Consumer Genetics Partnership

### Partnership with 23andMe, AncestryDNA, or Similar

**Opportunity**: 30+ million Americans have taken DTC genetic tests (23andMe, AncestryDNA—data already exists)

**Problem**: Most DTC tests don't report AATD variants (or report incompletely—miss rare variants)

**Solution**: Partner with DTC company to:

1. **Flag AATD Variants**: Update their database (identify customers with S, Z, rare variants)
2. **Notify Customers**: "Your genetic data suggests AATD risk—get clinical testing" (email, app notification)
3. **Refer to Foundation**: Provide link to Foundation (education, testing assistance, specialist referral)

---

### Partnership Model (Proposed)

**Phase 1: Data Mining (Year 1)**:

- 23andMe/Ancestry agrees to reanalyze existing customer data (30M+ samples)
- Look for SERPINA1 variants (S, Z—common variants included in standard SNP arrays)
- Identify 300K-500K customers with potential AATD (carriers or affected)

**Phase 2: Customer Notification (Year 2)**:

- Email campaign ("Your DNA shows potential Alpha-1 risk—learn more")
- Link to Foundation website (educational resources, testing assistance)
- Offer clinical-grade confirmation (partner lab—$100 test, Foundation subsidizes if needed)

**Phase 3: Expanded Testing (Year 3+)**:

- DTC company adds comprehensive AATD panel (test all known variants, not just S and Z)
- Include AATD in standard health reports (currently hidden or not reported)
- Partner with Foundation (every AATD result includes Foundation resources)

---

### Precedent: 23andMe + Other Disease Foundations

**Examples**:

- **BRCA (Breast Cancer)**: 23andMe reports BRCA1/BRCA2 variants (breast/ovarian cancer risk—FDA approved)
- **Parkinson's**: Michael J. Fox Foundation partnered with 23andMe (research study—recruited 100K+ participants)
- **Alzheimer's**: 23andMe reports APOE variants (Alzheimer's risk—opt-in)

**AATD is Precedented**: Other rare genetic diseases reported by DTC tests (Foundation can negotiate similar partnership)

---

### Expected Impact

**Data Mining**: 300K-500K customers flagged (potential AATD carriers or affected)

**Conversion**: 10% follow through with clinical testing (30K-50K new diagnoses over 5 years)

**Family Cascade**: Each diagnosis → 3-5 relatives tested → 60K-100K additional tests (20K-30K new diagnoses)

**Total**: 50K-80K new diagnoses (vs. current 2K/year—25-40x increase)

---

## At-Home Testing Program

### Program Design: "AATD Home Test Kit"

**What Patient Receives**:

- Test kit (saliva collection tube OR finger prick lancet + collection card)
- Instructions (easy-to-follow, pictures, QR code to video tutorial)
- Pre-paid return envelope (USPS or FedEx)
- Genetic counseling voucher (30-min telehealth session included)

**Patient Process**:

1. **Order Kit**: Online (Foundation website—$100, or free if uninsured)
2. **Collect Sample**: At home (spit in tube or prick finger, 5 min)
3. **Mail Sample**: Drop in mailbox (pre-paid envelope)
4. **Wait 2-3 Weeks**: Lab processes (DNA extraction, SERPINA1 sequencing)
5. **Receive Results**: Online portal (secure, HIPAA-compliant—genetic counselor explains)
6. **Next Steps**: If abnormal → Foundation connects to specialist, resources

---

### Partnership Lab Options

**Option 1: Invitae** (Preferred):

- Specialty genetic testing company (comprehensive SERPINA1 sequencing—all variants)
- DTC-friendly (existing platform for at-home kits)
- Affordable ($100-$250—Foundation negotiates bulk pricing)
- Genetic counseling included (part of their service)

**Option 2: Color Genomics**:

- Similar to Invitae (comprehensive testing, counseling included)
- Slightly higher cost ($250-$400—but very comprehensive)

**Option 3: 23andMe** (If partnership established):

- Already have at-home kit infrastructure (30M+ customers tested)
- Would need to add comprehensive AATD panel (currently only S and Z)
- Lowest cost potential ($50-$100—economies of scale)

**Recommendation**: Partner with Invitae (Year 1-2), explore 23andMe partnership (Year 3+)

---

### Pricing & Subsidy Model

**Retail Price**: $100/kit (covers lab cost, counseling, Foundation overhead)

**Insurance Reimbursement**: Submit to patient's insurance (many plans cover genetic testing—especially if abnormal AAT level)

**Foundation Subsidy** (For Uninsured/Low-Income):

- Income <150% FPL (~$45K family of 4) → 100% subsidy (free test)
- Income 150-250% FPL (~$45K-$75K) → 50% subsidy ($50 test)
- Income >250% FPL → full price ($100)

**Year 1 Budget**: $50K (subsidize 250-500 tests)

---

### Marketing & Promotion

**Target Audiences**:

1. **Abnormal AAT Level**: Patients who had low AAT but never did genetic test (Foundation Navigator reaches out)
2. **Family Members**: Relatives of diagnosed patients (cascade testing)
3. **High-Risk Individuals**: COPD patients, liver disease patients (promote via support groups, clinics)
4. **Direct-to-Consumer**: Online ads (Facebook, Google—"Do you have AATD? Test at home")

**Promotion Channels**:

- Foundation website (dedicated page—order kit, learn more)
- Social media (patient testimonials—"I tested at home, so easy!")
- Email campaigns (monthly newsletter—feature at-home testing)
- Doctor education (promote to pulmonologists, primary care—"Offer at-home testing to patients")

**Year 1 Goal**: 500 kits distributed

**Year 3 Goal**: 2,500 kits/year

---

## Insurance & Reimbursement

### Current Reimbursement Landscape

**AAT Level Testing**:

- CPT Code: 82103, 82104 (well-established—most insurance covers)
- Reimbursement: $50-$150 (standard lab test)

**Genetic Testing**:

- CPT Codes: 81332 (targeted—S and Z only), 81479 (full sequencing—rare variants)
- Reimbursement: Variable ($200-$1,000—depends on plan, medical necessity documentation)
- Coverage: 70-80% of plans cover (if abnormal AAT level—medical necessity)

---

### Improving Reimbursement (Foundation Advocacy)

**Strategy 1: Clinical Utility Evidence**:

- Publish studies (genetic testing changes treatment, improves outcomes)
- ATS/ERS guidelines (recommend genetic testing for all abnormal AAT—strengthen recommendations)
- Present to payers (show genetic testing is cost-effective—early diagnosis prevents expensive ER visits, hospitalizations)

**Strategy 2: Medicare/Medicaid Coverage**:

- Advocate for universal coverage (Medicare—covers 60M+ Americans, Medicaid—80M+)
- If Medicare covers → commercial plans follow (Medicare sets standard)

**Strategy 3: At-Home Test Reimbursement**:

- Obtain CPT code for at-home genetic test (currently ambiguous—lab-based codes don't clearly apply to DTC)
- Demonstrate equivalence (at-home test = same quality as lab test)
- Year 2-3 Goal: At-home test reimbursed by insurance (removes cost barrier)

---

## Technology Innovation

### Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) for AATD

**Current**: Most labs use PCR-based genotyping (test only S and Z—miss rare variants)

**Future**: NGS panels (sequence entire SERPINA1 gene—identify ALL variants, including novel mutations)

**Benefits**:

- ✅ Comprehensive (catch rare variants—null alleles, F, I, M variants)
- ✅ Cost-effective (NGS prices dropping—$100-$200/test now, was $1,000+ 5 years ago)
- ✅ Research value (identify new variants—contribute to scientific knowledge)

**Foundation Action**:

- Partner with NGS labs (Invitae, GeneDx—promote comprehensive testing)
- Educate doctors ("Don't just test S and Z—order full sequencing")

---

### Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) Integration

**Vision**: As WGS becomes standard of care (predicted in 10-20 years—$100 genome), AATD genotype automatically known

**How**:

- Newborns get WGS at birth (entire genome sequenced—stored for life)
- SERPINA1 variants automatically flagged (no separate test needed)
- High-risk individuals monitored proactively (before symptoms)

**Foundation Role**:

- Advocate for WGS in newborn screening (AATD one of many actionable conditions identified)
- Partner with genomics initiatives (All of Us Research Program, UK Biobank—include AATD in research)

---

### CRISPR Gene Therapy (Future—But Requires Genetic Testing)

**Context**: Gene therapy for AATD in development (clinical trials underway—edit SERPINA1 gene in liver cells)

**Requirement**: Must know exact genotype (ZZ, SZ, rare null—therapy tailored to mutation)

**Foundation Action**: Ensure all AATD patients genetically confirmed NOW (so they're ready when gene therapy approved—predicted 2030-2035)

---
