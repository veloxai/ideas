## The Production Challenge

### Current State: AAT is Expensive

**Cost**: $100,000-$200,000 per patient per year

**Why so expensive?**:

1. **Source**: Derived from human blood plasma (donated blood)
2. **Limited supply**: Only ~8,000 AATD patients currently treated (out of 100,000+ diagnosed)
3. **Complex purification**: Multi-step process to isolate AAT from plasma
4. **Monopoly market**: 3 manufacturers (Grifols, CSL Behring, Takeda) control supply

**Market dynamics**:

- Total AATD market: $800M-$1.6B/year (8,000 patients × $100-200K)
- If ALL diagnosed patients treated: $10-20B/year (100K patients)
- If ALL ZZ individuals treated (diagnosed + undiagnosed): $30-40B/year (300K patients)
- **Repurposing market (firefighters, asthma, military)**: $60-70B/year

**Bottleneck**: Current production can't scale to meet potential demand

---

### The Opportunity

**If we could lower AAT production cost by 50-75%**:

✅ **More AATD patients treated**:

- Current: 8,000 patients ($100-200K/year)
- Potential: 50,000+ patients ($50-75K/year)
- Patients who can't afford or lack insurance coverage could access

✅ **Repurposing becomes economically viable**:

- Firefighters: $5,000/year prophylaxis (vs. $100K current cost)
- Military: $10,000/year treatment
- Asthma: $15,000/year add-on therapy
- **Expands market 40-50x**

✅ **Global access**:

- Low/middle-income countries could afford AAT
- 500,000-1M+ patients worldwide

✅ **Revenue for foundation**:

- Patent royalties from repurposing (Mark's patent)
- More patients = more impact = more donations

---

## Current Production Methods

### Plasma-Derived AAT (Current Standard)

**How it works**:

1. Collect donated blood plasma (plasmapheresis)
2. Pool plasma from thousands of donors
3. Fractionate plasma (separate proteins)
4. Purify AAT (chromatography, filtration)
5. Viral inactivation (heat treatment, nanofiltration)
6. Formulate and fill into vials
7. Quality testing (potency, purity, safety)

**Yield**: ~1-2 grams AAT per liter of plasma

**Annual production capacity** (all 3 manufacturers combined):

- ~10,000-15,000 patients' worth
- Constrained by plasma supply (donor availability)

---

### Advantages of Plasma-Derived AAT

✅ **Proven safety**: 30+ years of use
✅ **Identical to human AAT**: Natural protein, no immunogenicity
✅ **FDA-approved**: 4 products on market

---

### Disadvantages of Plasma-Derived AAT

❌ **Limited supply**: Dependent on blood donors
❌ **High cost**: Labor-intensive, complex purification
❌ **Risk of contamination**: Bloodborne pathogens (though extremely rare with modern safety measures)
❌ **Scalability**: Can't easily expand beyond donor pool
❌ **Batch variability**: Slight differences between batches

---

## Novel Production Technologies

### Option 1: Recombinant AAT (Mammalian Cell Culture)

**How it works**:

- Insert human AAT gene into mammalian cells (CHO cells, HEK cells)
- Cells produce AAT protein
- Harvest and purify from cell culture medium

**Advantages**:
✅ **Unlimited supply**: Not dependent on blood donors
✅ **Scalable**: Can build larger bioreactors
✅ **No bloodborne pathogen risk**
✅ **Consistent batches**: Same cell line = same product

**Disadvantages**:
❌ **Post-translational modifications**: May differ slightly from human AAT (glycosylation patterns)
❌ **Immunogenicity risk**: Cells may add sugars differently → potential immune response
❌ **Regulatory hurdle**: FDA may require extensive safety testing
❌ **Cost**: Still expensive (though cheaper than plasma-derived)

**Examples**:

- Kamada has recombinant AAT in clinical trials (Phase 2/3)
- Expected cost: $50-75K/patient/year (30-50% reduction)

**Status**: Promising, but not yet FDA-approved

---

### Option 2: Recombinant AAT (Yeast or Bacteria)

**How it works**:

- Insert AAT gene into yeast (e.g., Pichia pastoris) or bacteria (E. coli)
- Fermentation (grow in large tanks)
- Harvest and purify

**Advantages**:
✅ **Much cheaper**: Fermentation is inexpensive
✅ **Highly scalable**: Industrial fermentation capacity enormous
✅ **Fast production**: Weeks vs. months for mammalian cells
✅ **No bloodborne pathogen risk**

**Disadvantages**:
❌ **No glycosylation**: Bacteria/yeast don't add human-like sugars to proteins
❌ **Reduced function**: AAT glycosylation affects stability and activity
❌ **Immunogenicity risk**: "Foreign" protein may trigger immune response
❌ **Regulatory hurdle**: FDA skeptical of non-glycosylated AAT

**Research needed**: Glycoengineering (modify yeast to add human-like sugars)

**Status**: Early research stage, no clinical trials yet

---

### Option 3: Transgenic Animals (e.g., Goats, Cows)

**How it works**:

- Insert human AAT gene into animal embryo
- Gene targets milk production (AAT secreted in milk)
- Collect milk, purify AAT

**Advantages**:
✅ **Very high yield**: Liter of milk can contain grams of AAT
✅ **Scalable**: Herd of animals = large production capacity
✅ **Proper glycosylation**: Mammalian milk = human-like sugars
✅ **Low cost**: Farming cheaper than cell culture

**Disadvantages**:
❌ **Long development time**: Breed transgenic animals (years)
❌ **Public perception**: "Pharming" controversial, GMO concerns
❌ **Regulatory complexity**: FDA has limited experience with animal-derived biologics
❌ **Consistency**: Variation between animals

**Examples**:

- GTC Biotherapeutics developed AAT from transgenic goats (ATryn, different protein)
- Technology proven for other proteins

**Status**: Feasible but controversial, no AAT product yet

---

### Option 4: Transgenic Plants

**How it works**:

- Insert AAT gene into plant (rice, tobacco, algae)
- AAT expressed in seeds or leaves
- Harvest and purify

**Advantages**:
✅ **Extremely cheap**: Agriculture is inexpensive
✅ **Massive scale**: Acres of plants = tons of protein
✅ **No bloodborne pathogen risk**
✅ **Environmentally friendly**: Plants grow with sunlight and water

**Disadvantages**:
❌ **No glycosylation** (or plant-specific glycosylation, not human-like)
❌ **Reduced function**: May not work as well as human AAT
❌ **Immunogenicity risk**
❌ **Regulatory hurdle**: FDA has approved very few plant-made pharmaceuticals

**Status**: Early research, unlikely to succeed for AAT (glycosylation critical)

---

### Option 5: Cell-Free Protein Production

**How it works**:

- Extract cellular machinery (ribosomes, enzymes)
- Add AAT gene (DNA or mRNA)
- Protein produced in test tube (no living cells)

**Advantages**:
✅ **Very fast**: Hours to days (vs. weeks/months for cell culture)
✅ **Scalable**: Industrial-scale reactors exist
✅ **Flexible**: Can produce different proteins quickly

**Disadvantages**:
❌ **No glycosylation**: Cell-free systems don't add sugars
❌ **High cost**: Expensive reagents
❌ **Yield**: Lower than cell culture

**Status**: Emerging technology, not yet viable for AAT

---

### **Recommended Approach: Recombinant AAT (Mammalian Cell Culture)**

**Why**:

- ✅ Most promising near-term (Kamada already in Phase 2/3 trials)
- ✅ Proven technology (many other biologics produced this way)
- ✅ FDA-approvable (pathway clear)
- ✅ 30-50% cost reduction achievable
- ✅ Scalable to meet repurposing demand

**Foundation's role**: Support research, partner with manufacturers, advocate for FDA approval

---

## Cost Reduction Strategy

### Target: Reduce Cost from $100-200K/year to $50-75K/year (50% reduction)

**How to achieve**:

**1. Recombinant Production (30-40% savings)**:

- Eliminate plasma collection costs
- More efficient purification (designed cell line)
- Higher yield per production run

**2. Economies of Scale (10-20% savings)**:

- Larger batches (as demand grows with repurposing)
- Shared manufacturing infrastructure
- Bulk purchasing of raw materials

**3. Competition (10-15% savings)**:

- More manufacturers enter market (currently only 3)
- Price competition drives costs down

**4. Biosimilars (20-30% savings after patent expiration)**:

- Original AAT patents expired (Prolastin patent: 1995)
- Biosimilars can undercut price
- Already happening in Europe

---

### Pricing Strategy

**Current Pricing**:

- Wholesale: $80-120K/patient/year
- Patient cost: $100-200K/year (with markups, insurance processing)

**Target Pricing (with recombinant AAT)**:

- Wholesale: $40-60K/patient/year
- Patient cost: $50-75K/year
- **Still profitable for manufacturers** (manufacturing cost ~$10-20K/patient)

**Repurposing Pricing**:

- Firefighters (prophylaxis): $5,000/year (low dose)
- Military (treatment): $10,000/year
- Asthma (adjunct): $15,000/year
- **At these prices, market expands 40-50x**

## Regulatory Considerations

### FDA Approval for Recombinant AAT

**Pathway**: 351(a) Biologics License Application (BLA)

**Requirements**:

- Demonstrate biosimilarity to plasma-derived AAT (structure, function, purity)
- Phase 3 clinical trial (non-inferiority vs. plasma-derived)
- Manufacturing consistency (batch-to-batch reproducibility)
- Safety (immunogenicity, adverse events)

**Accelerated Approval Possible**:

- Breakthrough Therapy Designation (if significantly better than plasma-derived)
- Priority Review (if fills unmet need—arguably yes for lower cost)

**Timeline**: 6-10 months FDA review after BLA submission

---

### Biosimilar Pathway

**For Follow-On Products** (after first recombinant AAT approved):

**351(k) Biosimilar Pathway**:

- Demonstrate biosimilarity to reference product (Kamada's recombinant AAT or plasma-derived)
- Reduced clinical trial requirements (abbreviated Phase 3)
- Faster approval

**Interchangeability**:

- If biosimilar designated "interchangeable" → pharmacists can substitute without doctor approval
- Requires switching studies (show safety when switching between products)

**Market Impact**: Biosimilars typically 15-35% cheaper than originator

---

### International Regulatory

**EMA (Europe)**:

- Similar biosimilar pathway
- Europe ahead of US (biosimilar AAT already available in some countries)

**WHO Prequalification**:

- Enables use in low-income countries
- Supported by GAVI, Global Fund
- Foundation should advocate for AAT inclusion

---
