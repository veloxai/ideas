## Repurposing Vision

### Beyond AATD: AAT for Millions

**Current Reality**:

- AAT used ONLY for AATD (rare disease, ~100K diagnosed in US)
- Market: $800M-$1.6B/year
- Helps: 8,000-10,000 patients currently

**Vision**:

- AAT used for inflammatory lung conditions (common diseases)
- Market: $60-70B/year
- Helps: Millions of people (firefighters, veterans, asthma patients)

**Why this matters**:

- ✅ More people helped (foundation's mission)
- ✅ Revenue funds AATD research (Mark's patent royalties)
- ✅ Economies of scale → lower AAT cost for AATD patients
- ✅ Validates Mark's expertise and vision

---

- **Reinvest in AATD research and patient programs**

---

## Scientific Rationale

### Why AAT Works Beyond AATD

**AAT's Mechanism of Action**:

**1. Protease Inhibition**:

- AAT blocks neutrophil elastase (primary target)
- Also inhibits proteinase-3, cathepsin G, matrix metalloproteinases
- Proteases break down lung tissue → emphysema, fibrosis

**2. Anti-Inflammatory Effects**:

- Reduces neutrophil activation and migration
- Decreases cytokine production (IL-8, TNF-α)
- Modulates immune response

**3. Tissue Protection**:

- Prevents elastin degradation (lung scaffolding)
- Maintains airway integrity
- Promotes healing

---

### Universal Pathway: Inflammation → Protease Release → Tissue Damage

**Smoke Inhalation** (firefighters):

- Smoke → neutrophils rush to lungs → release elastase → lung damage
- AAT blocks elastase → protects lungs

**Burn Pit Exposure** (military):

- Toxic fumes → inflammation → protease release → chronic lung disease
- AAT prevents progressive damage

**Severe Asthma**:

- Airway inflammation → neutrophil activation → tissue remodeling
- AAT reduces inflammation and protease activity

**Same mechanism, different triggers → AAT should work**

---

### Existing Evidence

**Clinical Studies**:

- Small trials show AAT reduces inflammation in non-AATD COPD
- Case reports of AAT benefit in COVID-19 ARDS (reduced mortality)
- AAT reduces neutrophil elastase activity in cystic fibrosis

**Animal Models**:

- AAT protects against smoke inhalation injury in mice
- Reduces acute lung injury from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
- Prevents ventilator-induced lung injury

**Observational Data**:

- AATD patients with severe deficiency but no smoking → often have normal lungs until exposure event
- Suggests AAT particularly protective against acute insults (smoke, infection)

**Bottom line**: Strong scientific rationale + preliminary evidence → worth investigating

---

## Research Priority 1: Firefighters

### The Problem

**Firefighter Respiratory Health Crisis**:

- 50% of firefighters develop chronic respiratory symptoms
- Leading cause of on-duty deaths: Cardiac + respiratory
- Early retirement due to lung disease
- Workers' comp claims: $Billions annually

**Risk Factors**:

- Smoke inhalation (every fire, even with SCBA)
- Toxic chemicals (burning plastics, furniture, buildings)
- Particulate matter (soot, ash)
- Cumulative exposure over career

**Current Interventions** (insufficient):

- SCBA (self-contained breathing apparatus) - not always used properly
- Post-fire decontamination
- Medical monitoring (chest X-rays, spirometry)
- NO preventive medications

---

### Research Questions

**Primary Question**: Does prophylactic AAT prevent acute and chronic respiratory injury in firefighters?

**Secondary Questions**:

- Optimal timing: Before fire exposure, after, or both?
- Optimal dosing: How much AAT needed? How often?
- Which firefighters benefit most: All, or only high-frequency exposures?
- Biomarkers: Can we measure AAT's protective effect (inflammatory markers, lung function)?
- Long-term: Does AAT prevent COPD/emphysema over career?

---

### Proposed Studies

**Phase 1: Pilot Study (Year 1-2, N=50)**

**Design**:

- Randomized, placebo-controlled
- Participants: Healthy career firefighters
- Intervention: AAT 60 mg/kg IV OR placebo (saline)
- Timing: Within 4 hours after fire exposure (structure fire)
- Follow-up: 48 hours

**Endpoints**:

- Primary: Change in inflammatory biomarkers (IL-8, neutrophil elastase, C-reactive protein)
- Secondary: Symptom scores (cough, shortness of breath), spirometry, adverse events

**Cost**: $500K (AAT product, lab tests, site costs)

**Expected Outcome**: 30-50% reduction in inflammatory markers with AAT vs. placebo

---

**Phase 2a: Dose-Finding (Year 3-4, N=150)**

**Design**:

- Three-arm trial: Low dose AAT (30 mg/kg), High dose AAT (60 mg/kg), Placebo
- Participants: Career firefighters
- Timing: Within 4 hours post-exposure
- Follow-up: 7 days

**Endpoints**:

- Optimal dose (lowest dose with maximal effect)
- Duration of effect

  - Group 1: AAT weekly (prophylaxis) + AAT post-fire
  - Group 2: Placebo weekly + AAT post-fire
  - Group 3: Placebo weekly + placebo post-fire
- Duration: 12 months
- Follow-up: Lung function, symptom diaries, biomarkers (quarterly)

**Endpoints**:

- Primary: Change in FEV1 (lung function) over 12 months
- Secondary: Respiratory symptom scores, exacerbations, inflammatory biomarkers, quality of life

**Cost**: $3M

**Key Question**: Is prophylactic AAT (weekly) better than post-exposure only?

---

**Phase 3: Definitive Trial (Year 6-8, N=1,000)**

**Design**:

- Multi-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
- Participants: Career firefighters (10-20 fire departments nationwide)
- Intervention: AAT (optimal regimen from Phase 2) vs. Placebo
- Duration: 3 years
- Primary endpoint: Lung function decline (FEV1 slope)
- Secondary: Respiratory symptoms, hospitalizations, career longevity, quality of life

**Cost**: $15-20M (pharma partner would fund)

**Expected Outcome**: 40-60% reduction in lung function decline with AAT

---

### Implementation Strategy

**Recruitment**:

- Partner with International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF)

---

## Research Priority 2: Military Applications

### The Problem

**Burn Pit Exposure**:

- 3.5 million deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan (2001-2021)
- Burn pits used to dispose of waste (trash, chemicals, human waste, equipment)
- Toxic smoke exposure (24/7 for months)
- 30-40% of deployed veterans report respiratory symptoms

**Health Effects**:

- Chronic cough, shortness of breath
- Constrictive bronchiolitis (rare, severe airway disease)
- Asthma
- COPD/emphysema (early-onset)
- Increased cancer risk

**Current Treatment**: Symptomatic only (inhalers, oxygen)

- No disease-modifying therapy

**VA Burden**:

- 500,000+ burn pit exposure claims
- $10-20B in disability payments (projected)

---

### Research Questions

**Primary Question**: Does AAT reduce progression of burn pit-related lung disease?

**Secondary Questions**:

- Can AAT reverse damage (improve lung function)?
- Optimal timing: Treat immediately after deployment vs. years later?
- Biomarkers to identify veterans who will benefit most?
- Prevention: AAT prophylaxis during deployment?

---

### Proposed Studies

**Phase 2: Proof of Concept (Year 3-4, N=100)**

**Design**:

- Randomized, placebo-controlled
- Participants: Veterans with burn pit exposure + lung disease (FEV1 <80%)
- Intervention: AAT 60 mg/kg IV weekly vs. Placebo
- Duration: 24 weeks
- Follow-up: Lung function, symptoms, inflammatory biomarkers

**Endpoints**:

- Primary: Change in FEV1
- Secondary: 6-minute walk distance, quality of life, exacerbations, biomarkers

**Cost**: $2M

**VA Partnership**: Co-fund with VA Research (veterans benefit directly)

---

**Phase 3: Efficacy Trial (Year 5-7, N=300)**

**Design**:

- Multi-site (VA hospitals nationwide)
- Randomized, placebo-controlled
- Duration: 18-24 months
- Primary endpoint: FEV1 decline (slope)

**Cost**: $10-15M (VA + DOD co-funding)

**Expected Outcome**: 30-50% slowing of lung function decline

---

### Prevention Strategy (Aspirational)

**Pre-Deployment Prophylaxis**:

- AAT given before/during deployment to high-risk personnel
- Prevent burn pit lung disease before it starts
- Similar to malaria prophylaxis

**Feasibility**:

- Requires long-term safety data (Phase 1/2 studies)
- DOD would need to fund large trial (N=5,000-10,000)
- Timeline: 10+ years

**Foundation's Role**:

- Advocate with DOD for research funding
- Provide preliminary data from firefighter studies
- Connect researchers with military stakeholders

---

## Research Priority 3: Severe Asthma

### The Problem

**Asthma Prevalence**:

- 25 million Americans with asthma
- 3.6 million with severe/uncontrolled asthma
- Despite multiple medications, still have symptoms and exacerbations

**Neutrophilic Asthma**:

- Subtype driven by neutrophils (not eosinophils like typical asthma)
- Less responsive to steroids
- Associated with neutrophil elastase activity
- **AAT could be effective**

**Unmet Need**:

- Biologics (Dupixent, Xolair) help some, but not all
- 40-50% of severe asthma patients still uncontrolled
- Frequent ER visits, hospitalizations, steroid bursts

---

### Research Questions

**Primary Question**: Does AAT reduce exacerbations in severe neutrophilic asthma?

**Secondary Questions**:

- Does AAT allow steroid dose reduction (steroid-sparing effect)?
- Optimal delivery: IV vs. inhaled AAT?
- Which asthma phenotype benefits: Neutrophilic vs. eosinophilic vs. mixed?
- Biomarkers: Neutrophil elastase levels predict response?

---

### Proposed Studies

**Phase 2: Pilot Study (Year 3-4, N=60)**

**Design**:

- Randomized, placebo-controlled, add-on trial
- Participants: Severe asthma (≥2 exacerbations in past year), neutrophilic (sputum neutrophils >40%)
- Intervention: AAT 60 mg/kg IV weekly + standard therapy vs. Placebo + standard therapy
- Duration: 24 weeks

**Endpoints**:

- Primary: Exacerbation rate (asthma attacks requiring steroids or ER visit)
- Secondary: Lung function (FEV1), asthma control (ACQ score), quality of life (AQLQ), biomarkers (sputum neutrophil elastase)

**Cost**: $1.5M

**Expected Outcome**: 40-60% reduction in exacerbations

---

**Phase 2b: Inhaled AAT (Year 4-5, N=80)**

**Design**:

- Compare inhaled AAT (nebulized) vs. IV AAT vs. Placebo
- Rationale: Inhaled delivery = direct to lungs, more convenient, potentially more effective
- Duration: 24 weeks

**Cost**: $2M (includes inhaled AAT formulation development)

**Expected Outcome**: Inhaled AAT non-inferior to IV (or superior)

---

**Phase 3: Pivotal Trial (Year 6-8, N=600)**

**Design**:

- Multi-site, randomized, placebo-controlled
- Participants: Severe asthma (uncontrolled on high-dose ICS + LABA)
- Intervention: AAT (IV or inhaled, based on Phase 2 results) vs. Placebo
- Duration: 52 weeks
- Primary endpoint: Annual exacerbation rate
- Secondary: Steroid dose reduction, lung function, quality of life

**Cost**: $20-25M (pharma partner would fund)

**Expected Outcome**: FDA approval for AAT in severe asthma (2033-2035)

---

### Market Opportunity

**Target Population**: 3.6 million severe asthma patients in US

**Pricing**: $15,000-$20,000/year (add-on to existing therapy)

- Lower than biologics ($30-40K/year for Dupixent, Xolair)
- More affordable due to mass production (if repurposing succeeds)

**Market Size**: 3.6M × $15K = **$54B/year (US alone)**

**Even 10% penetration** = $5.4B/year

**Mark's Patent Royalty (10-15%)**: $500M-$800M/year

---

## Additional Applications

### COVID-19 and Viral ARDS

**Rationale**:

- COVID-19 → severe inflammation → elastase release → lung damage
- AAT could reduce progression to ARDS, improve survival

**Evidence**:

- Case reports of AAT reducing mortality in COVID-19
- Small trial in Italy showed benefit (N=30)

**Opportunity**:

- If another pandemic occurs, AAT could be stockpiled and deployed
- Foundation should maintain relationship with NIH, CDC (preparedness)

---

### Cystic Fibrosis

**Rationale**:

- CF lungs have high neutrophil elastase activity
- AAT could reduce airway damage, slow disease progression

**Evidence**:

- Small trials showed AAT reduces elastase activity, but mixed results on lung function

**Status**: More research needed (not high priority for foundation)

---

### Other Inflammatory Diseases

**Potential Applications** (exploratory):

- Rheumatoid arthritis (AAT has anti-inflammatory effects)
- Type 1 diabetes (AAT may preserve beta cells)
- Graft-versus-host disease (post-transplant)
- Inflammatory bowel disease

**Foundation's Role**: Monitor research, but focus on lung applications (core mission)

---

## Clinical Trial Strategy

### Sequencing & Prioritization

**Years 1-2**: Pilot studies (firefighters N=50, military N=50)
**Years 3-4**: Phase 2 studies (firefighters N=150, military N=100, asthma N=60)
**Years 5-7**: Phase 3 studies (firefighters N=1,000, military N=300, asthma N=600)
**Years 8-10**: FDA submissions and approvals

**Prioritization**:

1. **Firefighters** (first): Mark's personal connection, smaller market (easier to prove), rapid recruitment
2. **Asthma** (second): Largest market, clear FDA pathway, existing endpoints
3. **Military** (third): VA partnership takes time, but huge veteran benefit

---

### Trial Design Principles

**1. Pragmatic Design**:

- Real-world participants (not overly restrictive inclusion criteria)
- Feasible interventions (weekly infusions, not daily)
- Clinically meaningful endpoints (exacerbations, lung function, quality of life)

**2. Biomarker-Driven**:

- Measure neutrophil elastase activity, inflammatory markers
- Stratify by baseline levels (find who benefits most)
- Develop predictive models (personalized treatment)

**3. Patient-Centered**:

- Endpoints that matter to patients (symptoms, quality of life, career longevity)
- Patient representatives on steering committees
- Regular communication with participants

**4. Adaptive Design** (when appropriate):

- Adjust dose, duration based on interim results
- Drop futile arms early
- Accelerate promising arms

---

### Data Sharing & Collaboration

**Open Science Approach**:

- Publish results regardless of outcome (positive or negative)
- Share de-identified data with researchers (within 1 year of publication)
- Collaborate with other AATD/respiratory research groups

**Biorepository**:

- Collect and store blood, sputum, DNA samples
- Enable future research (biomarkers, genetics, mechanisms)
- Centralized repository (accessible to researchers with IRB approval)

---

- Becomes one of largest rare disease foundations (like MJFF, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation)

---

## Regulatory Pathway

### FDA Approval Process

**Indication 1: Firefighters** (Prevention of Smoke Inhalation Injury)

**Regulatory Strategy**:

- New indication for existing drug (AAT already approved for AATD)
- 505(b)(2) or sNDA (supplemental New Drug Application)
- Rely on existing AAT safety data (30+ years of use)
- Only need efficacy data for new indication

**Requirements**:

- Two Phase 3 trials (or one large trial + Phase 2 data)
- Primary endpoint: Lung function decline (FEV1 slope) or exacerbations
- 2-3 years follow-up

**Timeline**: 7-10 years (start to approval)

---

**Indication 2: Severe Asthma** (Add-on Therapy)

**Regulatory Strategy**: Similar to firefighters (505(b)(2) or sNDA)

**Requirements**:

- Phase 2 dose-finding + Phase 3 efficacy trial
- Primary endpoint: Exacerbation rate (standard asthma endpoint)
- 52-week duration

**Timeline**: 6-9 years

**Precedent**: Biologics for asthma (Dupixent, Xolair) approved with similar trials

---

**Indication 3: Military** (Burn Pit Lung Disease Treatment)

**Regulatory Strategy**: Similar to above

**Challenge**: No specific "burn pit lung disease" diagnosis code

- FDA may approve for "COPD in veterans with toxic exposure" (broader)

**Timeline**: 8-10 years

---

### Accelerated Approval Pathways

**Breakthrough Therapy Designation**:

- If Phase 2 shows dramatic effect (e.g., 60% reduction in exacerbations)
- Benefits: Intensive FDA guidance, faster review

**Fast Track Designation**:

- For unmet medical need (severe asthma, firefighter lung disease qualify)
- Benefits: Rolling review, more frequent FDA meetings

**Priority Review**:

- 6-month FDA review (vs. 10 months standard)
- If granted, speeds approval

**Foundation Should Pursue All Designations** (work with pharma partner to apply)

---
