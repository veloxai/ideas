## Current Research Landscape

### What We Know

**AATD Basics (Well-Established)**:

- Genetic cause (SERPINA1 gene mutations)
- Inheritance pattern (autosomal codominant)
- Primary effects (emphysema, cirrhosis)
- Natural history and progression

**Current Treatments**:

- Augmentation therapy (slows but doesn't cure)
- Standard COPD management
- Liver/lung transplantation

**Diagnostic Challenges**:

- Average 7-8 year delay
- Misdiagnosis common (asthma, COPD, bronchitis)
- Low awareness among physicians
- Testing underutilized

---

### What We Don't Know (Research Gaps)

**1. Early Detection**:

- How to identify AATD patients earlier?
- Better biomarkers or screening methods?
- Point-of-care testing (AAT "glucometer")?

**2. Disease Mechanisms**:

- Why do some ZZ patients get sick and others don't?
- Genetic modifiers (other genes that affect risk)?
- Role of environmental factors (smoking, exposures)?
- Liver disease mechanisms (why only 30-40% affected)?

**3. Treatment Optimization**:

- Does augmentation therapy prevent disease (vs. just slow)?
- Optimal timing to start therapy?
- Better delivery methods (inhaled, subcutaneous)?
- Combination therapies?

**4. Cure**:

- Gene therapy feasibility and safety?
- Gene editing (CRISPR) potential?
- Stem cell approaches?

**5. Repurposing AAT**:

- Can AAT protein protect firefighters, military?
- Efficacy in asthma, COVID-19, other inflammatory diseases?
- Optimal dosing and delivery?
