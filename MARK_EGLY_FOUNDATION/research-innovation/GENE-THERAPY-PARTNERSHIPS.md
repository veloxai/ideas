## Gene Therapy Overview

### The Promise: One-Time Cure for AATD

**Current Treatment Reality**:

- Augmentation therapy: Weekly IV infusions for life ($100K-$200K/year—never cured, only managed)
- Lung transplant: Last resort (5-year survival 50-60%—not curative, immunosuppression forever)
- Liver transplant: For liver disease (cures AATD—but major surgery, donor shortage, lifelong drugs)

**Gene Therapy Vision**:

- One-time treatment (single infusion or injection)
- Permanent cure (corrected genes produce normal AAT—for life)
- No more infusions (patient independence—free from weekly therapy)
- Prevents progression (start early—protect lungs before damage occurs)

**What Is Gene Therapy?**

- **Gene Addition**: Insert healthy M gene into liver cells (cells produce normal AAT—supplements deficient production)
- **Gene Editing**: Fix Z mutation → M mutation (CRISPR, base editors—correct defect at DNA level)
- **Gene Silencing + Replacement**: Turn off Z gene (stop producing toxic protein) + add M gene (restore normal AAT)

---

### Why Gene Therapy for AATD Makes Sense

**AATD is "Ideal" Gene Therapy Target**:

- ✅ **Single gene defect** (SERPINA1 gene—one target to fix)
- ✅ **Well-understood biology** (50+ years research—know exactly what's broken, how to fix)
- ✅ **Liver target** (AAT produced in liver—accessible organ, proven target for gene therapy)
- ✅ **Protein secreted** (once liver cells corrected, AAT circulates to lungs—no need to edit lung cells directly)
- ✅ **Small correction needed** (10-15% of normal production may be therapeutic—don't need 100% efficiency)
- ✅ **Existing biomarker** (plasma AAT level—easy to measure success)

**Precedent**:

- Hemophilia gene therapy (approved 2022—similar biology, liver-targeted AAV therapy, one-time cure)
- Sickle cell gene therapy (approved 2023—CRISPR editing, curative)
- $2M-$3M price tag (one-time cost vs. $100K-$200K/year lifetime—cost-effective over 10-20 years)

---

## Current Landscape

### Gene Therapy Approaches in Development

**1. AAV Gene Addition** (Adeno-Associated Virus—Insert M Gene)

**Companies/Programs**:

- **Applied Genetic Technologies (AGTC)** / **Alcon** (now Asclepix Therapeutics—after merger)
  - Program: rAAV-AAT (AAV8 vector, liver-targeted, delivers M gene)
  - Status: Phase 1/2 clinical trial (2022-2024—dose escalation, safety, efficacy)
  - Results: Plasma AAT increased 30-70 mg/dL (dose-dependent—some patients reached protective levels >50 mg/dL)
  - Duration: Unclear (gene expression may fade over 5-10 years—repeat dosing needed?)

- **Moderna Therapeutics**
  - Program: mRNA-AAT (lipid nanoparticle delivery, liver uptake, cells produce AAT from mRNA)
  - Status: Preclinical (animal studies—moving toward Phase 1)
  - Advantage: Repeat dosing possible (mRNA temporary—not permanent gene change, but can redose monthly/quarterly if needed)
  - Challenge: Durability (mRNA degrades—need frequent dosing, may not be "cure")

---

**2. CRISPR Gene Editing** (Fix Z → M Mutation)

**Companies/Programs**:

- **Beam Therapeutics**
  - Program: BEAM-302 (base editor—changes single DNA letter, Z → M)
  - Status: Preclinical (IND-enabling studies—preparing for Phase 1/2 in 2025-2026)
  - Advantage: Permanent correction (edits DNA—no more Z protein produced, M protein replaces it)
  - Challenge: Off-target editing (CRISPR may cut wrong spots—safety monitoring critical)

- **Intellia Therapeutics** / **Regeneron**
  - Program: In vivo CRISPR (LNP delivery, liver-targeted, CRISPR-Cas9 editing)
  - Status: Preclinical research (AATD not primary focus—working on ATTR amyloidosis, but technology applicable)

---

**3. Gene Silencing + Replacement** (Stop Z, Add M)

**Approach**:

- Use RNAi or antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to silence Z gene (stop making toxic protein)
- Plus AAV or mRNA to add M gene (restore normal AAT production)
- Advantage: Treats both lung AND liver disease (silencing removes liver toxicity, replacement protects lungs)

**Status**: Academic research (not yet in clinical trials—proof-of-concept in mice)

---

### Clinical Trial Status (2025)

**Active Trials**:

- AGTC/Asclepix rAAV-AAT: Phase 1/2 (enrollment complete, data analysis—results expected 2025-2026)
- Beam Therapeutics BEAM-302: IND filing 2025 (Phase 1/2 start 2026)

**Near-Term Trials** (Next 2-3 Years):

- Moderna mRNA-AAT: Phase 1 expected 2026-2027
- Additional programs (Intellia, other biotech—interest in AATD growing)

**Timeline to Approval**:

- Optimistic: 2030-2032 (if Phase 1/2 successful, accelerated approval—like hemophilia gene therapy)
- Realistic: 2032-2035 (Phase 3 trials needed, long-term safety data—FDA cautious with gene therapy)
- Pessimistic: 2035+ (if durability issues, need repeat dosing—may not qualify as "cure")

---

## Foundation's Role

### Why Foundation Involvement Matters

**Challenge**: Gene therapy companies focus on science, not patients

- Companies: Discover therapy, run trials, get FDA approval (business model: sell to pharma or commercialize)
- Gap: Patient enrollment, education, long-term monitoring, access/affordability (companies less equipped for this)

**Foundation Fills Gaps**:

- ✅ **Patient Recruitment**: Foundation's registry (10,000 patients by Year 5—trial-ready population)
- ✅ **Education**: Prepare community (what is gene therapy? risks/benefits? how to participate?)
- ✅ **Trial Support**: Navigate process (screening, consent, travel, follow-up—reduce patient burden)
- ✅ **Advocacy**: Push for access (insurance coverage, pricing negotiations—ensure patients can afford it)
- ✅ **Long-Term Monitoring**: Post-approval surveillance (5, 10, 20 years—track durability, safety)

**Value to Companies**:

- Faster enrollment (registry accelerates patient identification—trials finish sooner)
- Higher retention (Foundation support reduces dropout—complete data sets)
- Real-world evidence (Foundation registry tracks outcomes—complement clinical trial data)
- Market access (Foundation advocates for reimbursement—ensure commercial success)

---

## Partnership Strategy

### Tier 1: Clinical Trial Partnerships (Near-Term—2025-2030)

**Target Companies**: AGTC/Asclepix, Beam Therapeutics, Moderna (active programs—trials underway or imminent)

**Foundation Offers**:

1. **Patient Recruitment**:
   - Foundation registry (identify trial-eligible patients—email, call, educate)
   - Target: 50-100 referrals per trial (accelerate enrollment by 6-12 months)

2. **Trial Site Support**:
   - Co-locate trial visits with Foundation events (annual conference, support groups—reduce travel burden)
   - Patient navigators (help with logistics—appointment scheduling, insurance authorization, travel arrangements)

3. **Education & Awareness**:
   - Webinars (introduce trial to community—explain eligibility, risks/benefits, enrollment process)
   - Materials (FAQs, videos, testimonials—demystify gene therapy, build trust)

4. **Data Contribution**:
   - Registry data (natural history—compare trial participants to untreated patients, contextualize outcomes)
   - Biospecimens (blood, DNA, lung function—pre-trial baseline data)

**Foundation Receives**:

- Trial updates (regular briefings—share results with community)
- Publication co-authorship (Foundation recognized as collaborator—scientific credibility)
- Patient access (Foundation patients prioritized for trials—community benefit)

**Budget**: $500K-$1M per trial partnership (staff time, patient support, education materials)

---

### Tier 2: Research Collaboration (Mid-Term—2025-2032)

**Target**: All gene therapy companies + academic researchers (broader than just active trials)

**Foundation Sponsors Research**:

1. **Durability Studies** ($500K-$1M):
   - Question: How long does AAV gene therapy last? (5 years? 10? 20?)
   - Approach: Long-term follow-up (measure AAT levels annually in trial participants—track gene expression over time)
   - Value: Informs re-dosing strategy (if expression fades, when to retreat? Foundation helps design long-term monitoring)

2. **Combination Therapy Research** ($500K-$2M):
   - Question: Can gene therapy + protein clearance be synergistic? (e.g., AAV-AAT + carbamazepine to clear existing ZZ polymers)
   - Approach: Animal studies → pilot human trial (Foundation funds, company provides gene therapy)
   - Value: Treat both lung AND liver disease (gene therapy alone may not clear liver polymers—combination could be superior)

3. **Pediatric Feasibility Studies** ($1M-$2M):
   - Question: Can we treat children before lung damage occurs? (gene therapy at age 10-15—prevent emphysema entirely?)
   - Approach: Pediatric PK/safety study (enroll 10-20 adolescent AATD patients—test safety, dosing in younger population)
   - Value: Prevention paradigm (treat before disease—not just slow progression, but prevent onset)

**Foundation Receives**:

- IP rights (co-own discoveries—royalty share if commercialized)
- Scientific advisory board seat (input on trial design, patient selection—ensure patient-centric approach)

**Budget**: $2M-$5M over 5 years

---

### Tier 3: Access & Affordability Advocacy (Post-Approval—2030+)

**Once Gene Therapy Approved**:

**Challenge**: $2M-$3M price tag (insurance may not cover—patients can't afford, therapy fails despite FDA approval)

**Foundation Advocates**:

1. **Insurance Coverage**:
   - Meet with payers (Aetna, UnitedHealthcare, Medicare—present cost-effectiveness data)
   - Argument: $2M one-time vs. $100K/year × 30 years = $3M lifetime (gene therapy cost-neutral or savings)
   - Outcome: Coverage policies (insurers agree to cover gene therapy—patients can access)

2. **Pricing Negotiations**:
   - Work with companies (propose outcomes-based contracts—pay only if therapy works)
   - Example: Pay $500K upfront, then $1.5M if AAT levels sustained 5 years (reduce upfront risk for payers)

3. **Patient Assistance**:
   - Foundation fund (financial assistance for uninsured/underinsured—$500K-$2M/year)
   - Co-pay support (cover patient out-of-pocket—$5K-$50K per patient, ensure no one priced out)

4. **Policy Advocacy**:
   - Lobby CMS (Medicare/Medicaid coverage—set precedent for private insurers)
   - Congress (legislation to support high-cost curative therapies—loan programs, tax credits for gene therapy)

**Budget**: $5M-$10M over 5 years (post-approval phase)

---

## Clinical Trial Support

### Patient Navigator Program for Gene Therapy Trials

**Service**: Dedicated navigators help patients through trial process (screening → enrollment → treatment → follow-up)

**Components**:

**1. Pre-Screening Education** (Before Enrollment):

- Webinars (what is gene therapy? how does trial work? risks/benefits?)
- 1-on-1 calls (answer questions—"Am I eligible?" "What if it doesn't work?" "Will I still need augmentation?")
- Decision aids (comparison charts—gene therapy vs. augmentation, transplant—help patients decide if trial right for them)

**2. Enrollment Support**:

- Eligibility screening (coordinate with trial sites—check inclusion/exclusion criteria before patient travels)
- Insurance authorization (work with trial coordinator—ensure visits covered by trial sponsor, not patient)
- Travel assistance (book flights, hotels—Foundation reimburses up to $2,000 per patient for trial-related travel)

**3. During-Trial Support**:

- Check-ins (monthly calls—"How are you feeling?" "Any side effects?" "Need anything?")
- Peer support (connect with other trial participants—online forum, phone buddies)
- Logistics help (appointment reminders, lab results tracking—reduce patient burden)

**4. Post-Trial Follow-Up**:

- Long-term monitoring (annual surveys—track AAT levels, lung function, quality of life for years after trial)
- Registry enrollment (integrate trial participants into Foundation registry—build long-term dataset)

**Staffing**:

- 2 Patient Navigators (RN or social worker—experienced with clinical trials, genetics, AATD)
- Serve 50-100 trial participants (across multiple trials—AGTC, Beam, Moderna, others)

**Budget**: $300K/year (staff, travel reimbursements, materials)

---

### Biospecimen & Data Contribution

**Foundation Collects Pre-Trial Baseline**:

- Blood samples (DNA, plasma—baseline AAT levels, genotype, biomarkers)
- Lung function (spirometry, CT scan—baseline emphysema severity)
- Quality of life (SF-36, SGRQ—baseline symptoms, activity limitation)

**Value to Trials**:

- Historical control data (compare trial participants to registry patients—strengthen results even without randomized control)
- Subgroup analysis (predict who responds best—age, baseline AAT, lung function—personalize therapy)

**Foundation Receives**:

- Trial data (de-identified results—add to registry, improve understanding of disease)
- Early access (Foundation patients get priority enrollment—community benefit)

**Budget**: $200K/year (lab costs, data management)

---

## Patient Education & Preparation

### Challenge: Gene Therapy is New, Complex, Scary

**Patient Concerns**:

- "Will it work?" (gene therapy failed in past—1999 Jesse Gelsinger death, trust shaken)
- "Is it safe?" (permanent DNA change—what if something goes wrong?)
- "Will I still need augmentation?" (gene therapy may not fully restore AAT—unclear if replacement therapy obsolete)
- "Can I afford it?" ($2M-$3M—even with insurance, co-pays could be $100K+)
- "What if it wears off?" (durability unknown—might need re-treatment in 5-10 years)

**Foundation's Role**: Build trust, manage expectations, prepare community

---

### Education Program: "Gene Therapy 101"

**1. Webinar Series** (6 webinars over 1 year):

- **Session 1**: "What Is Gene Therapy?" (basics—how it works, types, history)
- **Session 2**: "Gene Therapy for AATD" (current trials, results so far, timeline to approval)
- **Session 3**: "Risks & Benefits" (safety concerns, realistic expectations—balance hope with caution)
- **Session 4**: "Clinical Trials 101" (how trials work, eligibility, enrollment process)
- **Session 5**: "Life After Gene Therapy" (post-treatment monitoring, will I still need augmentation?, long-term unknowns)
- **Session 6**: "Cost & Access" (pricing, insurance, financial assistance—how to prepare)

**Audience**: 500-1,000 patients per webinar (live + recorded—YouTube for later viewing)

**Faculty**: Gene therapy researchers (academic + industry—credible speakers), patient advocates (trial participants—real experiences)

**Budget**: $50K/year (speaker fees, production, promotion)

---

**2. Patient Stories** (Testimonials from Trial Participants):

- Video interviews (5-10 min—"Why I joined gene therapy trial," "What treatment was like," "How I feel now")
- Written stories (blog posts—750 words, patient perspective)
- Peer support (trial participants available for 1-on-1 calls—answer questions from patients considering trials)

**Impact**: Build trust (real patients, not corporate marketing—relatable, authentic)

**Budget**: $30K/year (video production, patient travel reimbursement for filming)

---

**3. FAQ Document + Decision Aid**:

- Comprehensive FAQ (50+ questions—addressing all concerns)
- Decision aid (comparison table—gene therapy vs. augmentation vs. wait-and-see)
- Distribute (website, patient mailings, support groups—ensure all patients have info)

**Budget**: $20K (content development, design, printing)

---

### Managing Expectations: Gene Therapy ≠ Magic Bullet

**Realistic Messaging**:

- ✅ "Gene therapy MAY cure AATD for some patients" (not guaranteed—response varies)
- ✅ "Early results promising" (30-70 mg/dL AAT increase—many patients reached protective levels)
- ✅ "Durability unknown" (may last 5-10 years, possibly lifetime—need long-term data)
- ✅ "Not for everyone" (eligibility criteria—age, liver function, disease severity—some patients excluded)
- ✅ "Augmentation may still be needed" (gene therapy might not fully restore AAT—combination therapy possible)

**Avoid Over-Hyping**:

- ❌ "Gene therapy will cure AATD" (too definitive—set up for disappointment)
- ❌ "One-time treatment, done forever" (durability unclear—may need re-dosing)
- ❌ "Everyone should wait for gene therapy" (trials take years—patients may progress while waiting, augmentation still gold standard for now)

---

## Regulatory Advocacy

### Foundation as Patient Voice to FDA

**FDA Engagement**:

1. **Patient-Focused Drug Development (PFDD) Meeting**:
   - Request FDA host PFDD for AATD (like CF, Duchenne—bring patient perspective into regulatory review)
   - Foundation organizes (recruit patients to testify—share disease burden, unmet needs, willingness to accept risk)
   - Outcome: FDA hears directly from patients (may influence approval decisions—faster review, conditional approval, broader label)

2. **Advisory Committee Testimony**:
   - When gene therapy comes to FDA (CBER—Center for Biologics Evaluation & Research, advisory committee review)
   - Foundation testifies (present patient perspective—demand for cure, acceptable risk, post-market surveillance plan)
   - Impact: Advisory committee recommendation (approve? additional studies?—patient voice matters)

3. **Accelerated Approval Advocacy**:
   - Push for surrogate endpoint approval (AAT level increase—faster than waiting for lung function decline over 2-3 years)
   - Argument: Life-threatening disease, no cure, unmet need (criteria for accelerated approval met)
   - Outcome: Approval 2-3 years faster (conditional approval based on AAT increase, with post-market lung function study)

**Budget**: $100K/year (FDA meeting travel, consultant fees for regulatory strategy)

---

### CMS Coverage Advocacy (Medicare/Medicaid)

**Post-Approval Challenge**: FDA approval ≠ coverage (CMS may refuse to pay $2M-$3M for gene therapy)

**Foundation Strategy**:

1. **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**:
   - Commission health economics study ($200K—academic researchers, model gene therapy vs. augmentation lifetime costs)
   - Result: Gene therapy cost-effective (ICER <$150K/QALY—threshold for "cost-effective" in US)
   - Submit to CMS (National Coverage Determination request—argue gene therapy should be covered)

2. **Patient Testimonials**:
   - Bring patients to CMS (testify at public comment periods—personal stories of augmentation burden, need for cure)

3. **Political Pressure**:
   - Work with Congress (patient advocacy day—meet with legislators, ask for support)
   - Media campaign (op-eds, news stories—"Medicare Denies Life-Saving Gene Therapy" headlines put pressure on CMS)

**Timeline**: 1-2 years post-FDA approval (CMS review process slow—Foundation accelerates)

**Budget**: $500K over 2 years

---

## Long-Term Vision

### 2030-2035: Gene Therapy Becomes Standard of Care

**Scenario**: Gene therapy approved, covered by insurance, widely available

**Patient Journey** (2035):

- **Age 25**: Diagnosed with AATD (genetic test confirms ZZ)
- **Age 26**: Start augmentation therapy (temporary—bridge to gene therapy)
- **Age 28**: Eligible for gene therapy (lung function still good—FEV1 >70%, no significant emphysema)
- **Age 28**: Receive gene therapy (single infusion, outpatient procedure)
- **Age 29**: Stop augmentation (AAT levels >80 mg/dL—protective, therapy no longer needed)
- **Age 30-70+**: Live normal life (no infusions, no restrictions—cured)

**Foundation's Role** (Post-Approval):

- Patient registry (track 5,000-10,000 gene therapy recipients—long-term safety, durability, outcomes)
- Re-treatment program (if gene expression fades—identify patients, facilitate second dose)
- Pediatric expansion (advocate for treating children age 10-15—prevent disease before onset)
- Global access (export model to Europe, Asia—help international AATD communities establish gene therapy access)

---

### 2035-2040: CRISPR Editing Becomes Preferred Approach

**Second-Generation Gene Therapy**:

- Permanent correction (CRISPR base editing—no viral vector, no fading gene expression)
- Treat liver disease too (edit ZZ → M in existing liver cells—clear toxic polymers, restore normal AAT)
- Lower cost (no ongoing manufacturing—simple editing system, scalable)

**Foundation Advocacy**:

- Fund CRISPR research (preclinical → early clinical trials—$5M-$10M over 5 years)
- Regulatory strategy (work with FDA on editing safety—off-target monitoring, long-term surveillance)
- Public education (address CRISPR concerns—"designer babies," ethics—separate therapeutic editing from germline, build trust)

---

### 2040+: AATD Becomes Preventable Disease

**Newborn Screening + Gene Therapy**:

- All babies screened for AATD at birth (add SERPINA1 to newborn genetic panel—identify ZZ babies)
- Treat at age 5-10 (before any lung damage—gene therapy administered pre-symptomatically)
- Result: Zero AATD patients develop emphysema (disease prevented, not just managed)

**Foundation's Legacy**: Eliminate AATD as cause of lung disease (join polio, smallpox—diseases relegated to history)
