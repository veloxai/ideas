## Innovation Overview

### Vision: "The AAT Glucometer"

**Imagine**: A handheld device that measures circulating AAT levels in 5 minutes (like glucose monitoring for diabetes)

**Device Goals**:

- ✅ **Point-of-Care**: Use in doctor's office (no lab send-out—results during appointment)
- ✅ **Rapid**: Results in 5-15 minutes (vs. 3-7 days for traditional lab test)
- ✅ **Easy**: Finger prick or saliva sample (no venipuncture, minimal training required)
- ✅ **Accurate**: FDA-cleared (comparable accuracy to gold-standard nephelometry)
- ✅ **Affordable**: $50-$100 per test (vs. $200+ for lab test—insurance reimbursable)
- ✅ **Accessible**: Available in all primary care offices, urgent care, ERs, eventually home testing

**Impact**: Reduce diagnostic delay from 7-8 years to days/weeks (test symptomatic patients immediately)

---

### Strategic Importance

**Why This Device is Game-Changer**:

1. **Eliminates Testing Barrier**: Currently, doctors must order lab test (patient goes to lab, results take days, follow-up appointment needed). With rapid test, doctor gets result during visit → immediate referral to specialist if abnormal
2. **Enables Screening**: Test all COPD patients at diagnosis (current recommendation, rarely followed—too cumbersome). Rapid test makes screening feasible
3. **Home Monitoring**: Eventually, patients with AATD could self-test (monitor AAT levels during augmentation therapy—like diabetics check glucose)
4. **Revenue Stream**: Foundation licenses technology to medical device company (royalties fund Foundation programs—sustainable income)
5. **Mark's Legacy**: Uses Mark's patent insights (AAT protein research → testing innovation)

## The Problem: Current Testing Limitations

### Current AAT Testing Process (Slow & Cumbersome)

**Step 1: Doctor Orders Test**:

- Patient presents with symptoms (shortness of breath, young-onset COPD)
- Doctor suspects AATD (or follows guidelines to screen all COPD patients)
- Orders serum AAT level test (blood draw)

**Step 2: Lab Processing**:

- Patient goes to lab (Quest, LabCorp—separate appointment, travel)
- Phlebotomist draws blood (venipuncture—some patients anxious about needles)
- Sample sent to lab (processed via nephelometry or immunoassay)
- Results take 3-7 days (sometimes longer)

**Step 3: Follow-Up**:

- Doctor reviews results (days later)
- If abnormal (low AAT), orders confirmatory genetic test (another lab visit, another wait)
- Patient returns for follow-up appointment (discuss results, next steps)

**Total Time**: 2-4 weeks (from suspicion to diagnosis)

---

### Why This Process Fails

**1. Patient Drop-Off** (30-40% Never Complete Testing):

- Doctor orders test → patient forgets, procrastinates, or can't get to lab
- Results come back → patient doesn't schedule follow-up (assumes no news = good news)
- Abnormal result → patient overwhelmed, doesn't follow through with genetic testing

**2. Doctor Inertia**:

- Ordering lab test is extra work (EMR documentation, lab requisition, scheduling follow-up)
- No immediate feedback (doctor forgets, patient lost to follow-up)
- Low awareness of AATD (many doctors don't order test because "I've never seen a case")

**3. Access Barriers**:

- Rural patients (nearest lab 50+ miles away—not feasible)
- Uninsured patients (lab test $200-$400 out-of-pocket—can't afford)
- Urgent care/ER settings (can't order send-out tests—patient discharged before results)

**Result**: 7-8 year average diagnostic delay (300,000 Americans undiagnosed)

## The Solution: Rapid AAT Testing Device

### How It Works (Patient Perspective)

**Scenario: Primary Care Office**:

1. **Patient visits doctor** (shortness of breath, cough, wheezing)
2. **Doctor suspects AATD** (young patient, non-smoker, family history—or routine COPD screening)
3. **Doctor performs rapid test** (finger prick, drop of blood on test strip, insert in device)
4. **Device analyzes sample** (immunoassay, biosensor—measures AAT concentration)
5. **Results in 5-15 minutes** (device displays AAT level: Normal >90 mg/dL, Abnormal <90 mg/dL)
6. **Immediate Action**: If abnormal → doctor orders genetic testing, refers to pulmonologist (same visit—no lost follow-up)

**Patient Impact**: "I came in with a cough, walked out knowing I might have AATD, already scheduled with specialist."

- Share with doctor (export PDF report)

---

## Technology Options

### Option 1: Lateral Flow Immunoassay (Simplest)

**How It Works**:

- Similar to pregnancy test or COVID rapid test
- Blood sample applied to test strip (capillary action pulls sample along strip)
- AAT binds to antibody (creates visible line—intensity correlates with concentration)
- Device reads line intensity (optical sensor), calculates AAT level

**Pros**:

- ✅ Simple, mature technology (many FDA-cleared lateral flow tests exist)
- ✅ Low cost per test ($10-$20—similar to glucose strips)
- ✅ No electricity required (can be fully manual—visual read)

**Cons**:

- ❌ Lower precision (CV 10-15%—acceptable for screening, but less accurate than lab)
- ❌ Limited dynamic range (hard to measure very low or very high AAT accurately)

**Best For**: Screening in resource-limited settings (developing countries, rural clinics)

---

### Option 2: Electrochemical Biosensor (Preferred—Like Glucose Meters)

**How It Works**:

- Blood sample applied to test strip (contains electrodes coated with AAT antibody)
- AAT binds to antibody (changes electrical current—proportional to AAT concentration)
- Device measures current, calculates AAT level

**Pros**:

- ✅ High accuracy (CV <5%—comparable to lab nephelometry)
- ✅ Fast (results in 5 minutes)
- ✅ Proven technology (glucose meters use same principle—regulatory path clear)
- ✅ Quantitative (precise number, not just "high/low")

**Cons**:

- ❌ Moderate cost ($30-$50 per test—higher than lateral flow, but still affordable)
- ❌ Requires device (can't do manual read—need handheld reader)

**Best For**: Point-of-care in US (doctor's offices, urgent care, ERs)

---

### Option 3: Microfluidic Lab-on-Chip (Most Advanced)

**How It Works**:

- Blood sample loaded into cartridge (microfluidic channels separate plasma, mix with reagents)
- AAT reacts with detection antibody (fluorescence or colorimetric signal)
- Optical sensor reads signal, calculates AAT level

**Pros**:

- ✅ Highest accuracy (matches gold-standard nephelometry—could replace lab testing entirely)
- ✅ Multi-analyte potential (could test AAT + other biomarkers in one cartridge)
- ✅ Fully automated (minimal user skill required)

**Cons**:

- ❌ High cost ($100-$200 per test—expensive, insurance reimbursement uncertain)
- ❌ Complex device (expensive reader—$5K-$10K, limits distribution)
- ❌ Longer development time (bleeding-edge tech, regulatory risk)

**Best For**: Hospital labs, AATD centers of excellence (not primary care)

---

### Recommendation: Start with Option 2 (Electrochemical Biosensor)

**Rationale**:

- Proven technology (glucose meters have cleared regulatory path)
- High accuracy (FDA will accept, doctors will trust)
- Affordable ($30-$50 per test—insurance will reimburse)
- Fast development (2-3 years to market vs. 5+ for lab-on-chip)

**Pivot Strategy**: If successful, develop Option 1 (lateral flow) for international markets, Option 3 (lab-on-chip) for premium/hospital use

---

## Development Pathway

- **Test Strip Development**: Manufacture test strips at scale (antibody coating, electrode printing, quality control)
- **Alpha Testing**: Test with 100 patients (clinic setting—doctors use device, compare to lab)
- **Beta Testing**: Test with 500 patients (10 clinics—real-world use, refine based on feedback)

**Deliverable**: Functional prototype device + test strips (ready for clinical validation)

**Budget**: $2M (engineering team, materials, clinical testing)

---

### Phase 3: Clinical Validation (Year 3-4—Months 37-48)

**Objective**: Prove device is accurate, reliable, safe (FDA submission-ready)

**Activities**:

- **Clinical Study**: Enroll 1,000 patients (20 sites—mix of primary care, pulmonology, AATD centers)
- **Comparator**: Device vs. nephelometry (gold standard—every patient gets both tests)
- **Endpoints**: Sensitivity (% of low AAT correctly identified), specificity (% of normal AAT correctly identified), correlation (device vs. lab values)
- **FDA Pre-Submission**: Meet with FDA (discuss study design, endpoints, regulatory pathway—CLIA waiver potential)

**Deliverable**: Clinical validation report (demonstrate 95%+ accuracy, ready for FDA submission)

**Budget**: $3M (clinical study, FDA consulting, CRO management)

---

### Phase 4: FDA Clearance (Year 4-5—Months 49-60)

**Objective**: Obtain FDA clearance (510(k) pathway—most likely)

**Activities**:

- **510(k) Submission**: Submit to FDA (device description, clinical data, manufacturing quality, labeling)
- **FDA Review**: 3-6 months (FDA asks questions, requests additional data—common)
- **Clearance**: FDA approves device for sale (Class II medical device—moderate risk)
- **CLIA Waiver** (Optional): Apply for waiver (allows use by non-lab personnel—critical for point-of-care)

**Deliverable**: FDA clearance letter (device can be marketed in US)

**Budget**: $500K (FDA submission, regulatory consulting, quality systems)

---

### Phase 5: Commercialization (Year 5+—Months 61+)

**Objective**: Manufacture, distribute, sell device (or license to partner)

**Activities**:

- **Manufacturing Scale-Up**: Contract manufacturer (produce 10K-100K devices/year)
- **Sales & Distribution**: Direct sales to clinics, hospitals, labs OR partner with diagnostic company (e.g., Abbott, Roche—they handle sales)
- **Reimbursement**: Obtain CPT code (insurance reimbursement—critical for adoption), negotiate pricing with payers
- **Post-Market Surveillance**: Track device performance (adverse events, accuracy in real-world use—FDA requirement)

**Deliverable**: Device on market (sold to clinics, insurance reimbursed, patients tested)

**Budget**: $5M+ (manufacturing, sales, marketing—or funded by licensing partner)

---

## Regulatory Strategy

### FDA Pathway: 510(k) Clearance (Most Likely)

**Why 510(k)**:

- Device is "substantially equivalent" to existing cleared device (e.g., glucose meter, other immunoassay devices)
- Class II device (moderate risk—not life-sustaining, but medical decision tool)
- Faster than PMA (510(k) takes 3-6 months, PMA takes 1-3 years)

**Predicate Devices** (Examples of Similar Cleared Devices):

- Abbott i-STAT (point-of-care blood analyzer—cleared for various immunoassays)
- Siemens DCA Vantage (point-of-care HbA1c analyzer—similar biosensor technology)
- Alere Cholestech LDX (lipid panel analyzer—finger prick sample, rapid results)

**FDA Requirements**:

- Clinical validation (1,000+ patients, demonstrate accuracy vs. lab)
- Analytical validation (precision, linearity, interference studies)
- Quality systems (ISO 13485—manufacturing quality management)
- Labeling (instructions for use, warnings, limitations)

---

### CLIA Waiver (Critical for Point-of-Care Use)

**What is CLIA Waiver**:

- Allows device to be used by non-lab personnel (doctors, nurses, medical assistants)
- Without waiver, only certified lab technicians can perform test (limits point-of-care use)

**Requirements for Waiver**:

- Simple to use (minimal training required)
- Low error risk (device has built-in quality control)
- Accurate (comparable to lab test)

**Strategy**: Apply for CLIA waiver simultaneously with 510(k) (or shortly after clearance)

---

### International Regulatory (Future)

**CE Mark** (European Union):

- Required to sell in EU (easier than FDA—self-certification or notified body review)
- Timeline: 6-12 months after FDA clearance

**Other Markets** (Canada, Australia, Asia):

- Often accept FDA clearance (or require minimal additional testing)
- Partner with local distributor (handle regulatory, sales)

---

## Market & Distribution

### Target Markets (Prioritized)

**1. Primary Care Offices** (Highest Impact):

- 200,000+ primary care physicians in US (first point of contact for most AATD patients)
- Test symptomatic patients immediately (cough, shortness of breath, family history)
- **Market Size**: 50,000 offices buy device (assume 25% adoption) × 10 tests/year = 500K tests/year

**2. Pulmonology Practices**:

- 15,000 pulmonologists in US (diagnose/treat COPD, AATD)
- Screen all new COPD patients (current guideline, rarely followed—device makes it easy)
- **Market Size**: 10,000 pulmonologists × 50 tests/year = 500K tests/year

**3. Urgent Care & ERs**:

- Patients present with acute respiratory symptoms (exacerbation, pneumonia)
- Test if suspect AATD (young, severe symptoms, non-smoker)
- **Market Size**: 10,000 urgent care/ERs × 20 tests/year = 200K tests/year

**4. AATD Centers of Excellence**:

- 50+ specialized AATD clinics (Cleveland Clinic, National Jewish, Mayo, etc.)
- Monitor patients on augmentation therapy (check AAT levels during treatment—quarterly or monthly)
- **Market Size**: 10,000 AATD patients on therapy × 4 tests/year = 40K tests/year

**5. Home Testing** (Year 5+ Vision):

- Patients self-test (like diabetics test glucose—daily or weekly)
- Monitor augmentation therapy effectiveness (are AAT levels staying normal?)
- **Market Size**: 10,000 patients × 52 tests/year = 520K tests/year (long-term potential)

**Total Addressable Market**: 1.76M tests/year (US only—grow internationally Year 5+)

---

### Distribution Strategy

**Option 1: Direct Sales** (Foundation Sells Device):

- **Pros**: Higher margin (keep all revenue), control brand, direct relationship with customers
- **Cons**: Requires sales team (expensive), slow market penetration, regulatory burden (Foundation becomes device manufacturer)

**Option 2: Licensing to Diagnostic Company** (Recommended):

- **Partner Options**: Abbott, Roche, Siemens, Beckman Coulter (established device companies with sales infrastructure)
- **Structure**: Foundation licenses technology (royalty on each test sold—e.g., $5-$10 per test)
- **Pros**: Partner handles manufacturing, sales, regulatory, reimbursement (Foundation focuses on mission, not device business)
- **Cons**: Lower revenue per test (but higher volume, less risk)

**Recommendation**: Develop through Phase 3 (clinical validation), then license to partner (Year 4-5)

**Rationale**: Foundation's mission is patient impact, not device sales. Partner has expertise, resources, distribution network → faster adoption, wider impact

---

## Business Model & Revenue

### Revenue Projections (If Foundation Licenses to Partner)

**Assumptions**:

- Market penetration: 10% Year 1, 25% Year 3, 50% Year 5 (of 1.76M test market)
- Royalty: $5 per test (conservative—glucose strips pay $2-$5, AAT test could command higher)

**Year 1** (Post-Clearance):

- 176,000 tests × $5 royalty = **$880K revenue**

**Year 3**:

- 440,000 tests × $5 = **$2.2M revenue**

**Year 5**:

- 880,000 tests × $5 = **$4.4M revenue**

**10-Year Projection**: $30M+ cumulative revenue (sustains Foundation operations indefinitely)

---

### Cost to Foundation (Development Investment)

**Phase 1 (Proof of Concept)**: $250K
**Phase 2 (Device Development)**: $2M
**Phase 3 (Clinical Validation)**: $3M
**Phase 4 (FDA Clearance)**: $500K

**Total Development Cost**: $5.75M (Years 1-5)

**ROI**: Break-even in Year 7 (after $5.75M recouped via royalties), then $2M-$4M/year profit (funds Foundation programs in perpetuity)

---

### Funding Strategy

**Phase 1**: Foundation funds (use initial donations—$250K)

**Phase 2-3**: Raise dedicated funding:

- NIH SBIR/STTR grant ($1.5M—Small Business Innovation Research for medical devices)
- Corporate partnership (diagnostic company co-funds development in exchange for licensing option)
- Major donor ($2M gift—"Your donation will develop breakthrough diagnostic device")

**Phase 4-5**: Licensing partner funds (once partner signed, they fund FDA submission, commercialization)
