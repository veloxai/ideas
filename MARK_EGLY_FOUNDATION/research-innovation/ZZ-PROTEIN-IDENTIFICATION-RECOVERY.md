## Research Overview

### The Big Idea: Rescue the Trapped Protein

**Current Paradigm**:

- ZZ patients produce AAT protein (liver makes it)
- BUT: Protein misfolds (Z mutation causes structural abnormality)
- Misfolded protein gets stuck in liver (can't be secreted into blood)
- Result: Low circulating AAT (lung unprotected) + liver damage (toxic protein accumulation)

**Current Treatment**:

- Augmentation therapy (infuse normal AAT from donor plasma—replaces missing protein in lungs)
- Does NOT address liver disease (trapped protein still accumulating)
- Does NOT use patient's own protein (expensive, lifelong infusions needed)

**Revolutionary Approach**:

- **Identify trapped ZZ protein** in liver cells (can we detect it? tag it? track it?)
- **Rescue misfolded protein** (unfold and refold correctly? chaperone proteins?)
- **Enable secretion** (allow patient's own ZZ protein to escape liver, circulate to lungs)
- **Clear liver accumulation** (remove toxic aggregates—reverse liver damage)

**Potential Impact**:

- ✅ **Cure liver disease** (remove toxic protein—stop fibrosis, cirrhosis)
- ✅ **Restore lung protection** (patient's own AAT circulates—no more infusions)
- ✅ **One-time treatment?** (fix protein folding permanently—vs. weekly infusions for life)

## The ZZ Protein Problem

### What is the Z Mutation?

**Genetics**:

- SERPINA1 gene (chromosome 14—encodes Alpha-1 Antitrypsin protein)
- Z mutation: Glu342Lys (glutamic acid → lysine at position 342)
- Single amino acid change causes protein to misfold

**Protein Folding Defect**:

- Normal AAT (M variant): Folds correctly in liver ER (endoplasmic reticulum), secreted into blood
- Z AAT: Misfolds (abnormal loop structure), forms polymers (chains of stuck-together AAT molecules)
- Polymers trapped in ER (can't pass quality control—cell refuses to secrete defective protein)

**Consequences**:

- **Plasma deficiency**: Only 10-15% of normal AAT reaches blood (rest trapped—ZZ patients have 10-20 mg/dL vs. 150+ mg/dL normal)
- **Liver toxicity**: Trapped polymers accumulate (inclusions visible on biopsy—PAS+ globules), cause inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis (10-15% of ZZ patients)
- **Lung disease**: Unprotected from neutrophil elastase (enzyme that destroys lung tissue—AAT normally inhibits it)

---

### Why ZZ Protein Matters

**Patient Impact**:

- 100,000 ZZ individuals in US (estimated—many undiagnosed)
- 50-70% develop lung disease (emphysema, COPD—typically age 30-50)
- 10-15% develop liver disease (childhood cirrhosis, adult liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma)
- Augmentation therapy helps lungs (replace missing AAT) but NOT liver (trapped protein still accumulating)

**Unmet Need**:

- No treatment for AATD liver disease (except liver transplant—only option for end-stage cirrhosis)
- Pediatric AATD (5-10% develop severe neonatal cholestasis—liver failure in infancy, liver transplant or death)
- Augmentation therapy expensive ($100K-$200K/year—lifelong burden)

**If We Could Rescue ZZ Protein**:

- Treat liver disease (clear toxic aggregates—prevent/reverse cirrhosis)
- Reduce/eliminate need for augmentation (patient's own AAT circulates)
- Cure vs. chronic management (one-time intervention vs. lifelong therapy)

---

## Current Treatment Limitations

### Augmentation Therapy: Replacement, Not Cure

**How It Works**:

- Purify normal AAT from donor plasma (pooled from thousands of donors)
- Infuse weekly (60 mg/kg IV—raises plasma AAT to protective levels)
- Slows lung disease progression (reduces emphysema rate by ~30-40%)

**Limitations**:

- ✅ Helps lungs (replaces missing AAT in circulation)
- ❌ Doesn't fix liver (trapped ZZ protein still accumulating—liver disease progresses)
- ❌ Expensive ($100K-$200K/year—insurance battles, financial burden)
- ❌ Lifelong (weekly infusions forever—patient burden, compliance challenges)
- ❌ Doesn't use patient's protein (relying on donor supply—limited, expensive to purify)

---

### Liver Transplant: Last Resort

**When Needed**: End-stage cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma (10-15% of ZZ patients)

**What It Does**:

- Remove diseased ZZ liver, replace with healthy donor liver (M genotype—makes normal AAT)
- Cures BOTH lung and liver disease (new liver produces normal AAT—no more deficiency, no more toxic accumulation)

**Limitations**:

- ❌ Major surgery (high risk, 1-5% mortality, 30% complication rate)
- ❌ Lifelong immunosuppression (anti-rejection drugs—infection risk, kidney damage, cancer risk)
- ❌ Donor shortage (20,000 need liver transplant/year in US, only 8,000 available—many die waiting)
- ❌ Only for end-stage disease (not preventive—liver must fail first)

---

### Gene Therapy: Promising but Incomplete

**Approaches in Development**:

- AAV gene therapy (insert normal M gene into liver—cells produce normal AAT)
- CRISPR gene editing (edit Z mutation → M mutation in liver cells)

**Status**: Clinical trials (Phase 1/2—safety, dose-finding)

**Limitations** (Even When Approved):

- ✅ Fixes lung disease (new cells produce normal AAT—circulates to lungs)
- ❌ Doesn't remove ZZ protein (old cells still have trapped protein—liver disease risk remains)
- ❌ Durability unclear (gene therapy may fade over years—need repeat dosing?)
- ❌ Expensive (predicted $1M-$2M one-time cost—insurance coverage uncertain)

---

## Research Hypothesis

### Core Hypothesis: ZZ Protein is Recoverable

**Question**: Can we rescue misfolded ZZ protein (unfold, refold correctly, enable secretion)?

**Supporting Evidence**:

1. **Chemical Chaperones Work** (In Lab):
   - 4-Phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) reduce ZZ polymer formation (in cell culture—not yet tested in humans)
   - Improve ER protein folding (help quality control system tolerate slightly misfolded proteins)

2. **Autophagy Enhancers Clear Polymers**:
   - Carbamazepine (anti-seizure drug) activates autophagy (cellular "garbage disposal"—clears protein aggregates)
   - Reduces ZZ polymer accumulation in mouse models (human trials not yet done)

3. **Some ZZ Protein IS Secreted**:
   - 10-15% of ZZ AAT reaches blood (rest trapped—but some escape)
   - Suggests protein not 100% defective (minor rescue → more escapes?)

4. **Temperature-Sensitive Rescue**:
   - Lower temperature (in lab—33°C vs. 37°C body temp) improves ZZ folding (more protein secreted)
   - Suggests folding is "on the edge" (small nudge could tip toward correct folding)

**Hypothesis**:

- Pharmacological intervention (small molecule drug, chaperone protein, gene therapy adjunct) can:
  - Improve ZZ folding (reduce polymer formation—more protein folds correctly)
  - Enhance secretion (allow more ZZ AAT to reach circulation—10% → 30-50%?)
  - Clear existing polymers (autophagy, degradation—reduce liver toxicity)

**If True**: ZZ patients could produce therapeutic levels of their own AAT (reduce/eliminate augmentation need) + prevent liver disease

## Scientific Approach

### Phase 1: ZZ Protein Detection & Tracking (Years 1-2)

**Objective**: Develop tools to visualize, quantify ZZ protein in liver cells

**Approaches**:

**1. Fluorescent Probes**:

- Design antibody or small molecule that binds ZZ polymers (not normal AAT—specific for misfolded form)
- Tag with fluorescent dye (green, red—visible under microscope)
- Test in cultured cells (can we see ZZ accumulation? track over time?)
- Validate in mouse models (ZZ transgenic mice—do we detect polymers in liver?)

**2. Mass Spectrometry**:

- Extract protein from liver tissue (biopsy or autopsy samples—ZZ patients)
- Identify ZZ-specific post-translational modifications (misfolded protein may have different glycosylation, ubiquitination)
- Quantify polymer vs. monomer (how much is trapped vs. correctly folded?)

**3. Live-Cell Imaging**:

- Transfect cells with ZZ-GFP fusion protein (ZZ AAT with green fluorescent protein attached)
- Watch protein fold, traffic through ER, get secreted (or trapped)
- Identify bottlenecks (where does folding fail? ER? Golgi? secretion pathway?)

**Deliverable**: ZZ detection assay (can measure ZZ polymer levels in liver, track changes with treatment)

**Budget**: $500K (reagents, mice, imaging equipment, personnel)

---

### Phase 2: Protein Rescue Screening (Years 2-3)

**Objective**: Identify drugs/compounds that improve ZZ folding, secretion, or clearance

**Approach**: High-throughput screening

**1. Cell-Based Assay**:

- Culture cells expressing ZZ AAT (HepG2 liver cell line or patient iPSCs—induced pluripotent stem cells)
- Expose to drug library (10,000-50,000 compounds—FDA-approved drugs, natural products, experimental molecules)
- Measure AAT secretion (ELISA—how much ZZ AAT released into culture medium?)
- Measure polymer accumulation (immunofluorescence—how much ZZ trapped in cells?)

**2. Hit Validation**:

- Top candidates (drugs that increase secretion >50% or reduce polymers >50%) tested in dose-response
- Mechanism studies (how does drug work? chaperone? autophagy? other pathway?)
- Cytotoxicity screening (ensure drug not toxic to liver cells)

**3. Animal Testing**:

- Test top 5-10 compounds in ZZ mouse models (PiZ transgenic mice—express human ZZ AAT)
- Dose orally (once daily, 4 weeks)
- Measure plasma AAT (does it increase?), liver polymers (do they decrease?), liver enzymes (AST, ALT—liver damage markers)

**Deliverable**: 3-5 lead compounds (candidates for human testing)

**Budget**: $2M (screening facility, compound library, mice, personnel)

---

### Phase 3: Mechanism Studies (Years 3-4)

**Objective**: Understand HOW lead compounds rescue ZZ protein (mechanism of action)

**Approaches**:

**1. Structural Biology**:

- X-ray crystallography or cryo-EM (electron microscopy) of ZZ AAT ± drug
- Does drug bind to ZZ protein? Where? Change conformation?

**2. Chaperone Interaction Studies**:

- Co-immunoprecipitation (pull down ZZ protein, see what other proteins bound)
- Does drug recruit chaperones (BiP, calnexin, Hsp70—proteins that help folding)?

**3. Autophagy Pathway Analysis**:

- Western blots for autophagy markers (LC3, p62—increase = more autophagy)
- Electron microscopy (see autophagosomes—organelles that degrade aggregated protein)

**4. Genetic Validation**:

- CRISPR knockout (delete candidate genes—e.g., autophagy genes, chaperone genes)
- Does drug still work? If not, confirms mechanism

**Deliverable**: Mechanism-of-action paper (publish in Nature, Cell, Science—establish scientific credibility)

**Budget**: $1M (structural biology, proteomics, molecular biology)

## Therapeutic Strategies

### Strategy 1: Pharmacological Chaperone (Small Molecule Drug)

**Concept**: Drug binds to ZZ protein, stabilizes correct fold, enables secretion

**Precedent**:

- Trikafta (cystic fibrosis—corrects misfolded CFTR protein)
- Migalastat (Fabry disease—stabilizes alpha-galactosidase enzyme)

**Development**:

- Identify chaperone drug (high-throughput screen—Phase 2 above)
- Optimize chemistry (medicinal chemistry—improve potency, reduce side effects)
- Test in animals (efficacy, safety)
- Human trials (Phase 1/2/3—standard drug development)

**Timeline**: 10-15 years (drug discovery → FDA approval)

**Cost**: $50M-$100M (typical small molecule drug development)

**Advantages**:

- ✅ Oral pill (patient takes daily—convenient vs. weekly infusions)
- ✅ Potentially curative (if raises AAT to protective levels—no more augmentation)
- ✅ Treats liver disease (reduces polymer accumulation—prevents cirrhosis)

**Challenges**:

- ❌ Long timeline (decade+ to market)
- ❌ May not fully rescue protein (might need combo with augmentation—partial rescue)

---

### Strategy 2: Autophagy Enhancer (Repurposed Drug)

**Concept**: Drug activates autophagy (cellular degradation pathway—clears ZZ polymers from liver)

**Candidates** (Already FDA-Approved):

- **Carbamazepine** (anti-seizure drug—activates autophagy, shown to reduce ZZ polymers in mice)
- **Rapamycin** (immunosuppressant—potent autophagy inducer)
- **Metformin** (diabetes drug—mild autophagy activation, very safe)

**Development**:

- Clinical trial (repurpose existing drug—faster than new drug development)
- Enroll ZZ patients with liver disease (20-50 patients—Phase 2)
- Treat with drug (e.g., carbamazepine 400 mg twice daily—standard dose)
- Measure liver polymers (liver biopsy before/after—see if polymers decrease), liver enzymes (ALT, AST—improve?), plasma AAT (increase?)

**Timeline**: 3-5 years (repurposed drug—skip preclinical, go straight to human trial)

**Cost**: $5M-$10M (clinical trial costs)

**Advantages**:

- ✅ Fast (drug already approved—just need new indication)
- ✅ Cheap (generic drugs—carbamazepine $20/month)
- ✅ Treats liver disease (primary benefit—clear toxic polymers)

**Challenges**:

- ❌ May not increase circulating AAT (clears polymers but doesn't rescue folding—liver improves, lungs not helped)
- ❌ Side effects (carbamazepine—dizziness, drowsiness, drug interactions)

---

### Strategy 3: Gene Therapy + Polymer Clearance (Combination)

**Concept**: Gene therapy produces new normal AAT (fixes lung disease) + autophagy drug clears old ZZ polymers (fixes liver disease)

**Approach**:

- **Gene Therapy**: AAV-AAT (insert M gene—liver cells produce normal AAT)
- **Plus Autophagy Drug**: Carbamazepine or rapamycin (clear ZZ polymers from cells still making ZZ protein)

**Rationale**:

- Gene therapy only corrects ~20-30% of liver cells (rest still make ZZ—polymers still accumulating)
- Combination clears old polymers (reverse existing liver damage) + prevents new accumulation

**Development**:

- Piggyback on existing gene therapy trials (companies: Applied Genetic Technologies, Moderna—AAV-AAT trials ongoing)
- Add autophagy drug arm (gene therapy alone vs. gene therapy + carbamazepine)

**Timeline**: 5-7 years (leverage existing gene therapy, add drug arm)

**Cost**: $10M-$20M (combination trial)

**Advantages**:

- ✅ Treats both lung AND liver (gene therapy = lungs, autophagy = liver)
- ✅ Potentially curative (one-time gene therapy + short-term autophagy drug → permanent fix)

**Challenges**:

- ❌ Complex (two therapies—harder to coordinate, regulatory approval)
- ❌ Expensive (gene therapy $1M-$2M—affordability issue)

---

### Strategy 4: ZZ-Specific AAT Replacement (Novel Biologics)

**Concept**: Engineer modified AAT that resists polymerization (still has Z mutation but doesn't aggregate)

**Approach**:

- Protein engineering (modify ZZ AAT—add stabilizing mutations, prevent polymer formation)
- Test in vitro (does modified ZZ fold better? secrete more?)
- Gene therapy delivery (insert modified ZZ gene—patient's liver makes improved ZZ protein)

**Precedent**:

- Factor VIII engineering (hemophilia—improved protein stability)
- Insulin analogs (diabetes—modified insulin with better pharmacokinetics)

**Timeline**: 10-15 years (protein engineering → gene therapy → clinical trials)

**Cost**: $50M-$100M

**Advantages**:

- ✅ Uses patient's own genetic sequence (modified ZZ—not foreign M protein)
- ✅ Potentially better (engineered ZZ might have improved properties—longer half-life, higher activity)

**Challenges**:

- ❌ High risk (protein engineering unpredictable—may not work)
- ❌ Regulatory complexity (FDA may require extensive safety testing—modified protein is novel)
