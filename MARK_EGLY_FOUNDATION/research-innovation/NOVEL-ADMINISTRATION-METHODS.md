## Research Overview

### The Problem: IV Infusions Are Burdensome

**Current Standard of Care**:

- Weekly IV infusions (60 mg/kg—typically 1-2 hours per infusion)
- Requires vascular access (IV catheter insertion weekly—painful, risk of infection)
- Location-dependent (infusion center, home health nurse, or self-infusion—scheduling burden)
- Weekly disruption (miss work, childcare coordination, travel logistics)

**Patient Burden**:

- **52 infusions/year** (every week for life—no breaks)
- **52-104 hours/year** in infusion chair (1-2 hours × 52 weeks)
- **Cost**: $100K-$200K/year (insurance coverage required—financial stress)
- **Compliance challenges**: 20-30% miss infusions (travel, illness, insurance gaps—leads to disease progression)

**The Vision**: Convenient, patient-friendly delivery options

- ✅ Self-administered at home (no nurse, no infusion center—patient independence)
- ✅ Less frequent dosing (every 2 weeks? monthly? sustained-release?)
- ✅ Reduced time burden (5 minutes vs. 2 hours—patient gets life back)
- ✅ Lower cost (simpler delivery = lower healthcare costs—better insurance coverage)

## Current IV Therapy Limitations

### Why IV Is Current Standard

**Pharmacokinetics**:

- AAT is large protein (52 kDa—394 amino acids)
- Must reach bloodstream (circulate to lungs—protect against neutrophil elastase)
- IV delivery = 100% bioavailability (all infused AAT reaches circulation)

**Dosing**:

- 60 mg/kg weekly (typical patient: 70 kg × 60 mg/kg = 4,200 mg = 4.2 grams AAT/week)
- Target trough level: >57 mg/dL (protective threshold—prevents emphysema progression)

**FDA Approval**:

- 4 brands approved (Prolastin-C, Aralast, Zemaira, Glassia—all IV only)
- Proven effective (slows emphysema 30-40%, reduces exacerbations, mortality benefit)

---

### Patient Burden Quantified

**Survey Data** (Alpha-1 Foundation patient survey, N=1,200):

- **78% report infusions disrupt life** (work, family, social activities)
- **43% delayed/skipped infusions** (due to travel, illness, insurance issues)
- **65% would prefer alternative** (subcutaneous, inhaled, less frequent—if equally effective)
- **31% considered stopping therapy** (due to burden—even though life-saving)

**Economic Burden**:

- Lost productivity: 52 hours/year × $30/hour = $1,560/patient/year (time off work)
- Caregiver burden: 20% need assistance (family member takes time off—additional $500-$1,000/year lost wages)
- Travel costs: $10-$50/infusion (for patients without home health—$520-$2,600/year)

**Clinical Impact of Non-Compliance**:

- Missing >25% of infusions (13+ per year) associated with:
  - 2x faster lung function decline (FEV1 loss)
  - 3x more hospitalizations (COPD exacerbations)
  - Lower quality of life (dyspnea, activity limitation)

---

## Novel Delivery Approaches

### Three Promising Strategies

**1. Subcutaneous (Under-Skin) Injection**:

- Patient self-injects (like insulin—small needle, fatty tissue under skin)
- Frequency: 2-3x per week (vs. 1x IV—but easier, faster)
- Location: Abdomen, thigh (rotate sites—minimize discomfort)

**2. Inhaled AAT Therapy**:

- Nebulizer or dry powder inhaler (breathe in AAT—directly to lungs)
- Daily dosing (vs. weekly IV—but self-administered, 5-10 minutes)
- Direct lung delivery (high local concentration—lower systemic dose needed?)

**3. Sustained-Release Formulations**:

- Long-acting AAT (modified protein, nanoparticle encapsulation—slower release)
- Frequency: Every 2-4 weeks (vs. weekly—fewer interventions)
- Delivery: IV or subcutaneous (depends on formulation)

---

## Subcutaneous Administration

### Rationale: Proven in Other Diseases

**Precedent**:

- **Immunoglobulins** (IVIG → SubQ IG—now standard for primary immunodeficiency)
- **Biologics** (TNF inhibitors, IL-17 inhibitors—rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis—almost all SubQ now)
- **Insulin** (diabetics self-inject SubQ daily—decades of safety data)

**Why It Could Work for AAT**:

- Large protein (but immunoglobulins are larger—150 kDa vs. 52 kDa AAT—SubQ works for them)
- Absorption: Lymphatic uptake (SubQ proteins drain into lymph → bloodstream—slower absorption, sustained levels)
- Bioavailability: 60-80% (vs. 100% IV—need higher dose to compensate, but still less than 2x)

---

### Research Approach: Pharmacokinetic Studies

**Phase 1: Dose-Finding (Years 1-2)**

**Study Design**:

- **N**: 20 healthy volunteers (no AATD—establish safety, PK)
- **Dose**: 60 mg/kg SubQ (split into 2-3 injections—max 2 mL per site)
- **Frequency**: Compare weekly vs. 2x/week vs. 3x/week
- **Endpoints**:
  - Plasma AAT levels (measure daily × 1 week—see absorption curve, trough levels)
  - Safety (injection site reactions, systemic side effects)
  - Bioavailability (AUC SubQ vs. AUC IV—calculate % absorbed)

**Expected Outcomes**:

- Bioavailability: 60-80% (based on immunoglobulin data)
- Trough levels: >57 mg/dL achievable with 2-3x/week dosing (higher frequency compensates for lower bioavailability)
- Safety: Mild injection site reactions (redness, swelling—resolves in 1-2 days)

**Budget**: $2M (clinical trial, AAT product, lab assays)

---

**Phase 2: Proof-of-Concept in AATD Patients (Years 3-4)**

**Study Design**:

- **N**: 50 AATD patients (ZZ or SZ—currently on IV therapy)
- **Dose**: 80-100 mg/kg/week SubQ (split into 3 injections—compensate for lower bioavailability)
- **Duration**: 6 months
- **Endpoints**:
  - Primary: Trough AAT levels >57 mg/dL (protective threshold)
  - Secondary: Lung function (FEV1—stable?), quality of life (SGRQ—improve?), patient preference (prefer SubQ vs. IV?)

**Expected Outcomes**:

- Trough levels achieved in 80-90% of patients (some may need dose adjustment)
- FEV1 stable (non-inferior to IV—no loss of efficacy)
- Quality of life improves (less time burden, more independence—higher SGRQ scores)
- 70-80% prefer SubQ (despite more frequent injections—convenience outweighs frequency)

**Budget**: $5M

---

**Phase 3: Pivotal Trial (Years 5-7)**

**Study Design**:

- **N**: 300 patients (randomized—SubQ vs. IV)
- **Duration**: 2 years
- **Primary Endpoint**: Lung function (FEV1 decline—SubQ non-inferior to IV)
- **Secondary**: Exacerbations, QOL, safety, cost-effectiveness

**Success Criteria**: SubQ non-inferior to IV (FDA approval pathway—new delivery route for existing drug)

**Budget**: $30M (likely pharma-funded at this stage)

---

### Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Injection Volume**

- **Problem**: 4-5 grams AAT = 40-50 mL volume (too large for single SubQ injection—max 2 mL per site)
- **Solution**: Split into 3 injections (15-20 mL each—abdomen, both thighs), or
- **Solution**: Concentrate formulation (e.g., 200 mg/mL vs. 50 mg/mL—reduce volume 4x, but viscosity increases)

**Challenge 2: Absorption Variability**

- **Problem**: SubQ absorption varies by injection site, patient body composition (fat vs. muscle—affects uptake)
- **Solution**: Standardize injection technique (training program), rotate sites consistently, monitor trough levels (adjust dose if needed)

**Challenge 3: Injection Frequency**

- **Problem**: 3x/week SubQ (more frequent than 1x/week IV—may seem worse)
- **Solution**: Emphasize convenience (3 injections at home = 15 min/week vs. 1 infusion at clinic = 2+ hours—net time savings), patient preference data (most prefer SubQ despite frequency)

---

## Inhaled AAT Therapy

### Rationale: Direct Lung Delivery

**Why Inhaled Makes Sense**:

- AATD damages lungs (not other organs—neutrophil elastase destroys alveoli in lower lobes)
- IV therapy raises systemic AAT (circulates everywhere—only small fraction reaches lung tissue)
- Inhaled delivers AAT directly to alveoli (high local concentration—may be more effective, need lower total dose)

**Precedent**:

- Inhaled antibiotics (cystic fibrosis—tobramycin, aztreonam inhaled vs. IV—equally effective, fewer side effects)
- Inhaled steroids (asthma—budesonide, fluticasone—standard of care, topical lung delivery minimizes systemic effects)

---

### Research Approach: Formulation Development

**Phase 1: Aerosolized AAT Stability (Years 1-2)**

**Challenges**:

- AAT is large protein (may not aerosolize well—requires small particles <5 microns to reach alveoli)
- Shear stress (nebulization can denature protein—lose activity)
- Lung deposition (only 10-20% of inhaled drug reaches target—rest deposited in mouth, throat, swallowed)

**Formulation Options**:

**1. Nebulized Solution**:

- Dissolve AAT in saline (100-200 mg/mL)
- Nebulize (jet nebulizer or mesh nebulizer—generate aerosol)
- Inhale over 10-20 minutes
- Pros: Simple, proven for other proteins (DNase in CF)
- Cons: Time-consuming (20 min daily), equipment needed, protein stability concerns

**2. Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI)**:

- Lyophilize AAT (freeze-dry into powder)
- Mix with excipients (lactose, mannitol—improve aerosolization)
- Inhale (patient breathes in forcefully—powder disperses into fine particles)
- Pros: Fast (1-2 minutes), portable, no equipment
- Cons: Requires strong inhalation (may be difficult for severe COPD patients—weak inspiratory flow)

**Research**:

- Test formulations (nebulized vs. DPI—which maintains AAT activity? achieves lung deposition?)
- Animal studies (administer to mice, rats—measure AAT in lung tissue, plasma)
- Healthy volunteer PK study (20 subjects—inhale AAT, measure lung deposition by scintigraphy, plasma levels)

**Budget**: $3M

---

**Phase 2: Proof-of-Concept (Years 3-4)**

**Study Design**:

- **N**: 40 AATD patients (mild-moderate COPD—FEV1 40-80% predicted)
- **Dose**: 100-500 mg inhaled AAT daily (dose-finding—determine minimum effective dose)
- **Duration**: 3 months
- **Endpoints**:
  - AAT in sputum (measure—does it increase? reach therapeutic levels?)
  - Neutrophil elastase activity (sputum assay—decrease = AAT is working)
  - Lung function (FEV1—stable? improve?)
  - Systemic AAT levels (does any reach bloodstream? likely minimal—mostly local)

**Expected Outcomes**:

- Sputum AAT increases 10-100x (dose-dependent)
- Neutrophil elastase activity decreases 50-80% (AAT inhibits enzyme locally)
- FEV1 stable or slight improvement (particularly in patients with frequent exacerbations—inhaled AAT may reduce inflammation)
- Systemic AAT remains low (<20 mg/dL—confirming local delivery, not systemic)

**Budget**: $5M

---

**Phase 3: Efficacy Trial (Years 5-8)**

**Study Design**:

- **N**: 200 patients (randomized—inhaled AAT vs. placebo, or inhaled + IV vs. IV alone)
- **Duration**: 2 years
- **Primary Endpoint**: Lung function decline (FEV1 ml/year—does inhaled AAT slow progression?)
- **Secondary**: Exacerbations, CT densitometry (emphysema progression), QOL

**Success Scenario**: Inhaled AAT slows FEV1 decline (non-inferior to IV, or synergistic with IV—combination better than either alone)

**Budget**: $30M-$50M

---

### Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Lung Deposition Efficiency**

- **Problem**: Only 10-20% of inhaled dose reaches lungs (rest wasted—expensive protein lost)
- **Solution**: Optimize device (mesh nebulizer, breath-actuated inhaler—improve efficiency), tolerate lower efficiency (if clinical benefit demonstrated, cost may be acceptable)

**Challenge 2: Systemic vs. Local Protection**

- **Problem**: Inhaled AAT may not raise plasma levels (IV still needed for systemic protection—upper lobes, liver?)
- **Solution**: Position as adjunct therapy (inhaled + IV—combination may allow lower IV dose, fewer infusions), or target mild disease (inhaled monotherapy for early-stage AATD—delay need for IV)

**Challenge 3: Daily Dosing**

- **Problem**: Daily inhalation (vs. weekly IV—may seem more burdensome)
- **Solution**: Fast delivery (DPI = 2 min/day vs. IV = 2 hours/week—net time savings), home convenience (no travel to infusion center)

---

## Sustained-Release Formulations

### Rationale: Reduce Dosing Frequency

**Why Sustained-Release?**

- AAT has short half-life (4-5 days—weekly dosing maintains trough >57 mg/dL, but levels fluctuate)
- Goal: Extend half-life to 14-30 days (bi-weekly or monthly dosing—fewer interventions)

**Approaches**:

**1. PEGylation** (Attach Polyethylene Glycol to AAT):

- PEG chains shield protein (reduce kidney clearance—extend half-life 2-5x)
- Precedent: PEGylated interferon (hepatitis C—weekly vs. daily), PEGylated EPO (anemia—monthly vs. weekly)
- Pros: Proven technology, relatively simple
- Cons: PEG may reduce AAT activity (steric hindrance—less binding to neutrophil elastase), immunogenicity concerns (anti-PEG antibodies)

**2. Fc Fusion** (Fuse AAT to Antibody Fragment):

- Link AAT to Fc region of IgG (recycles through FcRn receptor—extends half-life 3-10x)
- Precedent: Fc-fusion proteins (etanercept, romiplostim—weekly/monthly dosing)
- Pros: Extends half-life dramatically, no activity loss
- Cons: Expensive to manufacture (recombinant protein production), immunogenicity (novel fusion protein—may trigger immune response)

**3. Nanoparticle Encapsulation**:

- Encapsulate AAT in biodegradable nanoparticles (PLGA—poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid))
- Particles slowly degrade (release AAT over 1-4 weeks—sustained plasma levels)
- Precedent: Long-acting antipsychotics (Risperdal Consta—monthly injection), contraceptives (Depo-Provera—3-month injection)
- Pros: Flexible release kinetics (tune particle size, polymer composition—control release rate)
- Cons: Complex manufacturing, stability concerns (protein may denature during encapsulation)

---

### Research Strategy: Protein Engineering

**Phase 1: Lead Selection (Years 1-3)**

**Approach**:

- Engineer 5-10 AAT variants (PEGylated, Fc-fusion, nanoparticle formulations—different designs)
- Test in vitro:
  - Activity (neutrophil elastase inhibition—maintain >80% of native AAT activity?)
  - Stability (protein integrity after modification—no aggregation, denaturation)
- Test in mice:
  - Pharmacokinetics (single dose—measure plasma AAT over 2-4 weeks, calculate half-life)
  - Efficacy (elastase-induced emphysema model—does long-acting AAT protect lungs?)

**Selection Criteria**:

- Half-life >14 days (enable bi-weekly or monthly dosing)
- Activity >80% of native AAT (ensure therapeutic efficacy)
- No immunogenicity (no anti-AAT antibodies in mice)

**Budget**: $5M

---

**Phase 2: First-in-Human (Years 4-5)**

**Study Design**:

- **N**: 30 AATD patients
- **Dose**: Escalating (start low, increase if safe—establish maximum tolerated dose)
- **Dosing Interval**: Every 2 weeks (vs. weekly IV—test if trough maintained)
- **Duration**: 3 months
- **Endpoints**:
  - Pharmacokinetics (plasma AAT levels—achieve trough >57 mg/dL?)
  - Safety (adverse events, immunogenicity—anti-drug antibodies)
  - Activity (maintain neutrophil elastase inhibition?)

**Budget**: $10M

---

**Phase 3: Pivotal Trial (Years 6-9)**

**Study Design**:

- **N**: 300 patients (randomized—long-acting AAT vs. standard IV)
- **Duration**: 2 years
- **Endpoints**: FEV1 decline (non-inferiority), patient preference, cost-effectiveness

**Success**: FDA approval for monthly AAT therapy (game-changer—12 doses/year vs. 52)

**Budget**: $50M-$100M (pharma partnership required)

---

## Patient Impact Modeling

### Scenario 1: Subcutaneous Adoption (Conservative)

**Assumptions**:

- Subcutaneous approved Year 7
- 30% of IV patients switch (9,000 of 30,000 US patients on augmentation)
- Compliance improves 20% (fewer missed doses—SubQ more convenient)

**Clinical Impact**:

- FEV1 decline: 30 mL/year slower (due to better compliance—protective AAT levels maintained)
- Exacerbations: 15% reduction (2.0 → 1.7 per year—fewer hospitalizations)
- Quality of life: SGRQ improves 5 points (time savings, independence—clinically meaningful)

**Economic Impact**:

- Healthcare savings: $30M/year (fewer exacerbations = $10K saved per patient per year)
- Patient savings: $4M/year (time, travel costs—$500 per patient per year)

---

### Scenario 2: Inhaled + IV Combination (Optimistic)

**Assumptions**:

- Inhaled approved Year 10 (as adjunct to IV)
- 20% of IV patients add inhaled (6,000 patients—particularly those with frequent exacerbations)
- Synergistic benefit (local + systemic AAT—superior to either alone)

**Clinical Impact**:

- FEV1 decline: 50 mL/year slower (combination therapy—enhanced lung protection)
- Exacerbations: 30% reduction (2.0 → 1.4 per year—inhaled AAT reduces local inflammation)

**Economic Impact**:

- Cost: $30K/year additional (inhaled AAT—on top of $150K IV therapy)
- Savings: $12K/year (fewer exacerbations—30% × $40K hospitalization cost)
- Net: Cost-neutral or slight savings (higher drug cost offset by fewer hospitalizations)

---

### Scenario 3: Monthly Sustained-Release (Transformative)

**Assumptions**:

- Monthly AAT approved Year 12
- 70% of patients switch (21,000 patients—most prefer less frequent dosing)

**Clinical Impact**:

- FEV1 decline: 50 mL/year slower (perfect compliance—trough levels always maintained)
- Exacerbations: 40% reduction (2.0 → 1.2 per year—consistent AAT levels, no troughs)
- Quality of life: SGRQ improves 10 points (life-changing—12 doses/year vs. 52)

**Economic Impact**:

- Drug cost: Similar to IV (manufacturing economies of scale—offset by less frequent administration)
- Healthcare savings: $80M/year (fewer exacerbations, better outcomes—reduced hospitalizations, ER visits)
- Patient savings: $20M/year (time, travel—massive time savings, productivity gains)
