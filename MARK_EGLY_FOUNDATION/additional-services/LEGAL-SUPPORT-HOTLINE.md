## Why Legal Support Matters

### Legal Barriers AATD Patients Face

**Statistics**:

- **68%** of AATD patients experience insurance denials (augmentation therapy, testing, specialist visits)
- **25%** face employment discrimination (fired, not hired, demoted due to AATD)
- **40%** of disability claims denied initially (Social Security, long-term disability)
- **< 5%** of patients can afford attorney ($300-$500/hour—$5K-$20K for insurance appeal, $10K-$50K for employment case)

**Common Legal Problems**:

1. **Insurance Denials** (most common—see Insurance Appeals Service doc)
2. **Employment Discrimination** (fired, not hired, denied promotion due to AATD)
3. **Disability Claims** (SSDI, SSI, long-term disability denials)
4. **ADA Violations** (employer refuses reasonable accommodations—flexible schedule for infusions, work-from-home, etc.)
5. **HIPAA Violations** (employer obtains medical records without consent, shares with colleagues)
6. **FMLA Denials** (employer denies Family Medical Leave for AATD-related absences)
7. **Life Insurance Discrimination** (denied coverage, charged exorbitant premiums)
8. **Guardianship/Custody** (AATD used against parent in custody dispute—"too sick to care for child")
9. **Estate Planning** (wills, trusts, healthcare directives—for patients with life-limiting disease)

**Why Patients Don't Get Legal Help**:

- ❌ **Cost**: Can't afford attorney ($300-$500/hour)
- ❌ **Don't Know Rights**: Unaware that discrimination is illegal, appeals are possible
- ❌ **Too Sick**: Lack energy to fight legal battles
- ❌ **Fear of Retaliation**: Afraid employer will fire them if they complain

**Foundation's Role**: Level the playing field (free legal help—ensure patients can enforce their rights)

---

## Legal Issues Covered

### Issue #1: Insurance Denials & Appeals

**Common Scenarios**:

- Augmentation therapy denied ("experimental," "not medically necessary")
- Genetic testing denied ("screening test," "not covered")
- Out-of-network specialist denied (no in-network AATD expert)
- Lung transplant evaluation denied ("premature")
- Liver biopsy denied ("not medically necessary")

**Legal Strategy**:

- **Internal Appeals**: ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) governs employer-sponsored insurance → specific appeal rights
- **External Appeals**: State insurance regulations (vary by state—some states have independent review process)
- **Bad Faith Claims**: If insurer acts in bad faith (e.g., denies medically necessary treatment to save money) → sue for bad faith
- **Department of Insurance Complaints**: File complaint with state insurance commissioner

**Attorney's Role**:

- Review denial letter (identify legal issues)
- Determine applicable law (ERISA vs. state insurance law—different rules)
- Advise on appeal strategy
- Draft appeal letter (legal arguments + medical evidence)
- Represent patient in external appeal hearing (if needed)

**Success Rate**: 50-70% (for appeals—higher with attorney representation)

**Note**: Most insurance appeals handled by Insurance Appeals Service (see separate doc)—Legal Hotline for complex cases (ERISA litigation, bad faith claims, class actions)

---

### Issue #2: Employment Discrimination

**Common Scenarios**:

- **Not Hired**: Job offer rescinded after employer learns about AATD (illegal—ADA violation)
- **Fired**: Terminated due to AATD (frequent sick days, need for infusions, on oxygen)
- **Denied Promotion**: Passed over due to perception that AATD patient can't handle job
- **Harassment**: Co-workers make comments about AATD ("Why are you always sick?" "Are you going to die?")
- **Forced Disclosure**: Employer requires disclosure of AATD diagnosis (violates ADA—can only ask if employee can perform essential job functions)

**Legal Framework**:

- **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)**: Prohibits employment discrimination based on disability (AATD qualifies if substantially limits major life activities—breathing, working)
- **Covers**: Employers with 15+ employees
- **Protections**:
  - Can't discriminate in hiring, firing, promotion, compensation
  - Must provide reasonable accommodations (unless undue hardship)
  - Can't ask about medical conditions (only: "Can you perform essential job functions?")
  - Medical records must be kept confidential (separate from personnel file)

**Legal Strategy**:

- **Internal Complaint**: File complaint with HR (document discrimination)
- **EEOC Complaint**: File with Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (federal) or state civil rights agency (required before lawsuit)
- **Lawsuit**: If EEOC doesn't resolve, file lawsuit (ADA discrimination, wrongful termination, retaliation)

**Damages** (if win):

- Back pay (wages lost due to termination)
- Front pay (future wages—if reinstatement not feasible)
- Compensatory damages (emotional distress)
- Punitive damages (if employer acted with malice)
- Attorney's fees (employer pays—if employee wins)

**Success Rate**: Varies (50-60% of EEOC charges result in no finding—but those that proceed to lawsuit have 30-40% success rate)

**Attorney's Role**:

- Assess case (is this ADA violation?)
- File EEOC complaint (required first step)
- Negotiate settlement (most cases settle—employer pays severance, back pay)
- Litigate (if no settlement—file lawsuit, go to trial)

---

### Issue #3: Disability Claims (SSDI, SSI, LTD)

**Common Scenarios**:

- **SSDI Denial**: Social Security Disability Insurance (for workers with sufficient work credits) denied → "Your AATD is not severe enough" or "You can still work"
- **SSI Denial**: Supplemental Security Income (for low-income disabled individuals) denied
- **Long-Term Disability Denial**: Private LTD insurance (through employer) denies AATD claim → "Not totally disabled," "Can perform sedentary work"

**Why AATD Disability Claims Are Denied**:

- ❌ **Invisible Disability**: AATD patients may look healthy (lung damage not visible externally) → adjudicators don't believe patient is disabled
- ❌ **Lack of Medical Evidence**: Need comprehensive documentation (spirometry, CT scans, oxygen saturation, 6-minute walk test, physician statements)
- ❌ **"Can Perform Sedentary Work"**: Even if can't do physical labor, SSA/LTD insurer may claim patient can do desk job

**Legal Strategy**:

- **SSDI/SSI**: 4-step appeals process (reconsideration → ALJ hearing → Appeals Council → federal court)
  - **Critical**: ALJ hearing (Administrative Law Judge—in-person hearing, patient testifies, medical expert testifies)
  - **Success Rate**: 50-60% (if reach ALJ hearing—much lower if only paper review)
- **LTD**: Follow policy's appeal process → if denied, sue under ERISA (in federal court)
  - **ERISA Standard**: "Abuse of discretion" (court defers to insurer—hard to win) OR "de novo" (fresh review—easier)

**Attorney's Role**:

- Review medical records (sufficient evidence?)
- Obtain additional evidence (pulmonary function tests, functional capacity evaluation, treating physician statement)
- Prepare patient for ALJ hearing (testimony, demeanor, what to say)
- Cross-examine medical expert (challenge insurer's doctor)
- Appeal denial (to Appeals Council, federal court if needed)

**Success Rate**:

- SSDI/SSI: 30% (initial application), 15% (reconsideration), 50% (ALJ hearing), 1-2% (Appeals Council/federal court)
- LTD: 30-40% (appeals), 50-60% (litigation)

**Timeline**: 1-3 years (SSDI/SSI from initial application to ALJ decision), 6 months-2 years (LTD appeal + litigation)

---

### Issue #4: ADA Reasonable Accommodations

**Common Scenarios**:

- **Flexible Schedule**: Need time off for weekly infusions (4 hours/week) → employer refuses
- **Work-From-Home**: On oxygen, difficult to commute → employer requires in-office
- **Modified Duties**: Can't lift heavy objects (lung capacity limited) → employer refuses to reassign tasks
- **Break Time**: Need breaks to use inhaler, rest → employer denies

**Legal Framework**:

- **ADA**: Employer must provide reasonable accommodations (unless undue hardship)
- **Reasonable Accommodations** (examples):
  - Flexible schedule (come in late for weekly infusion)
  - Telecommuting (work from home some/all days)
  - Modified duties (reassign physical tasks)
  - Longer/more frequent breaks (use inhaler, oxygen)
  - Leave of absence (for lung transplant, recovery)

**Legal Strategy**:

- **Request Accommodation**: Submit written request (email, letter—document)
- **Interactive Process**: ADA requires employer to engage in "interactive process" (discuss accommodations, find solution)
- **Denial**: If employer denies (must prove "undue hardship"—significant difficulty or expense)
- **EEOC Complaint**: If employer refuses accommodation (file EEOC charge—retaliation claim if fired)

**Attorney's Role**:

- Draft accommodation request (ADA-compliant language)
- Negotiate with employer (propose alternatives if first request denied)
- File EEOC complaint (if employer refuses)
- Litigate (if needed—ADA failure to accommodate claim)

---

### Issue #5: Other Legal Issues

**HIPAA Violations**:

- Employer obtains medical records without authorization (illegal)
- Employer shares AATD diagnosis with co-workers (violates confidentiality)
- **Legal Strategy**: File complaint with HHS Office for Civil Rights, sue for damages

**FMLA Denials**:

- Employer denies Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave for AATD-related absences (illegal if employee eligible—worked 12+ months, 1,250+ hours, employer has 50+ employees)
- **Legal Strategy**: File Department of Labor complaint, sue for FMLA interference

**Life Insurance Discrimination**:

- Denied coverage solely based on AATD diagnosis (may violate state insurance discrimination laws)
- **Legal Strategy**: File complaint with state insurance commissioner, consult attorney specializing in insurance law

**Custody Disputes**:

- Ex-spouse uses AATD diagnosis to argue parent is "unfit" (too sick to care for child)
- **Legal Strategy**: Obtain physician letter (AATD patient can parent effectively), family law attorney representation

**Estate Planning**:

- Patients with life-limiting disease need wills, healthcare directives, powers of attorney
- **Legal Strategy**: Pro bono estate planning attorney (draft documents)
