## Why Clinical Trials Matter

### For Patients: Access to Cutting-Edge Treatments

**Benefits of Participating in Clinical Trials**:

- ✅ **Early Access**: New treatments years before FDA approval (gene therapy, novel AAT formulations, anti-inflammatory drugs)
- ✅ **Expert Care**: Close monitoring by top specialists (free tests, exams, medications)
- ✅ **No Cost**: Investigational drug + trial-related care are free (insurance not billed)
- ✅ **Compensation**: Many trials pay for time/travel ($50-$500 per visit)
- ✅ **Altruism**: Help future AATD patients (advance science)
- ✅ **Hope**: For patients with advanced disease (trials may be last chance)

**Common Misconceptions** (Foundation Educates Patients):

- ❌ **"I'll get a placebo"**: Many trials have open-label extensions (everyone gets drug eventually)
- ❌ **"It's too risky"**: Trials have rigorous safety monitoring (IRB, data safety monitoring boards)
- ❌ **"I'll be a guinea pig"**: Informed consent protects patient rights; patients can withdraw anytime
- ❌ **"Trials are only for desperate patients"**: Trials enroll patients at all disease stages (early-stage trials prevent progression)

---

### For Research: Accelerate AATD Cure

**Patient Recruitment is Biggest Barrier**:

- **80% of clinical trials fail to meet enrollment goals** (delays, increased costs, trial cancellation)
- **Average trial enrollment rate**: 10-20% of eligible patients (most patients never hear about trials)
- **AATD-specific challenge**: Small patient population (100K-200K in US) → even harder to recruit

**Foundation's Impact**:

- ✅ **Awareness**: Promote trials to AATD community (email, social media, events)
- ✅ **Pre-Screening**: Reduce researcher burden (Foundation screens patients before referral)
- ✅ **Trust**: Foundation endorsement increases patient willingness (trusted intermediary)
- ✅ **Speed**: Faster enrollment → faster results → faster FDA approval → cure sooner

### Types of AATD Trials

**1. Gene Therapy Trials** 🔬 (Most Promising):

- **Goal**: Fix genetic defect (replace mutant SERPINA1 gene with functional gene)
- **Approach**: One-time infusion (AAV vector delivers corrected gene to liver)
- **Status**: Phase 1/2 trials ongoing (Vertex, Verve, Intellia, Takeda)
- **Impact**: POTENTIAL CURE (permanent fix—no more weekly infusions)

**2. Augmentation Therapy Trials**:

- **New Formulations**: Once-monthly IV (instead of weekly), subcutaneous (instead of IV), inhaled AAT
- **Examples**: Kamada (once-monthly IV), Grifols (subcutaneous), Takeda (inhaled)
- **Impact**: Improve convenience, reduce infusion burden

**3. Anti-Inflammatory Trials**:

- **Goal**: Reduce lung inflammation (slow emphysema progression)
- **Drugs**: PI3K inhibitors, chemokine receptor antagonists, anti-IL-8 antibodies
- **Impact**: Complement augmentation therapy (target inflammation, not just protein replacement)

**4. Liver Disease Trials**:

- **Goal**: Reduce ZZ protein accumulation in liver (prevent cirrhosis)
- **Drugs**: RNAi (silence mutant gene), small molecules (enhance ZZ protein degradation)
- **Examples**: Arrowhead (RNAi), Dicerna (RNAi)
- **Impact**: Prevent liver disease (currently no FDA-approved treatment for AATD liver disease)

**5. Observational Studies** (Non-Interventional):

- **Goal**: Track disease progression, quality of life, treatment outcomes
- **Examples**: AATD Registry studies, natural history studies
- **Impact**: Understand disease → inform future trial design

## Matching Process

### Step-by-Step Matching

**Step 1: Patient Inquiry**:

- Patient searches database (finds trial of interest)
- OR Patient calls Foundation (1-800-AATD-TRIAL)—Trial Navigator helps search

**Step 2: Pre-Screening Questionnaire**:

- Foundation administers questionnaire (10-15 min, phone or online)
- Questions:
  - Demographics (age, location)
  - AATD details (genotype, AAT level, diagnosis date)
  - Medical history (lung function, liver disease, comorbidities)
  - Current treatments (augmentation therapy, oxygen, medications)
  - Smoking status (current, former, never)
  - Willingness to travel (how far? overnight stays?)
- Foundation determines if patient meets basic eligibility (before referring to trial site)

**Step 3: Trial Site Referral**:

- If patient appears eligible, Foundation contacts trial site
- Provides patient's contact info + pre-screening summary (with patient's consent)
- Trial coordinator calls patient (within 3-5 business days)

**Step 4: Formal Screening**:

- Trial site conducts formal screening (detailed medical history, tests)
- May require in-person visit (screening visit—lung function, blood work, imaging)
- Determines final eligibility

**Step 5a: Enrolled** ✅:

- Patient signs informed consent
- Begins trial participation
- Foundation follows up (check in at 1 month, 6 months, end of trial)

**Step 5b: Not Eligible** ❌:

- Trial site explains why (doesn't meet criteria, too many participants enrolled, etc.)
- Foundation offers alternative trials (if available) or adds patient to registry (for future trials)
