## Why Career Counseling Matters

### Employment Challenges for AATD Patients

**Statistics**:

- **40%** of AATD patients are unemployed or underemployed (compared to 5-10% general population unemployment)
- **25%** have left workforce due to AATD (disability, unable to work)
- **35%** remain employed but struggle (frequent absences, performance issues, fear of disclosure)
- **50%** report employment discrimination (fired, not hired, passed over for promotion due to AATD)

**Why AATD Patients Struggle with Employment**:

**Physical Limitations**:

- ❌ **Reduced Stamina**: Lung disease → fatigue, shortness of breath (can't work 8-10 hour days, physical labor difficult)
- ❌ **Oxygen Dependence**: 15-20% of AATD patients require supplemental oxygen (limits mobility, job options)
- ❌ **Frequent Medical Appointments**: Weekly infusions (4 hours), doctor visits, pulmonary rehab (time off work)
- ❌ **Disease Progression**: Lung function declines over time (job that's manageable today may not be in 5 years)

**Employer Discrimination**:

- ❌ **Hiring**: Employers fear AATD patients will have poor attendance, high healthcare costs, won't perform well
- ❌ **Promotion**: Passed over due to perception of unreliability
- ❌ **Termination**: Fired for excessive absences (even if FMLA-protected)

**Patient Self-Limitation**:

- ❌ **Fear of Disclosure**: Don't disclose AATD to employer (fear discrimination) → don't request accommodations → struggle unnecessarily
- ❌ **Low Expectations**: Believe they can't work, contribute (internalized ableism)
- ❌ **Wrong Career**: Chose career before diagnosis (no longer compatible with AATD—e.g., firefighter, construction worker, teacher in dusty classroom)

---

### Consequences of Unemployment

**Financial**:

- ❌ **Loss of Income**: Can't afford medical care, housing, food
- ❌ **Loss of Insurance**: Lose employer-sponsored health insurance (must rely on COBRA, marketplace, Medicaid)
- ❌ **Medical Debt**: Can't pay medical bills (bankruptcy)

**Psychological**:

- ❌ **Depression**: Loss of purpose, identity (work = self-worth)
- ❌ **Isolation**: Social connections lost (colleagues, work friends)
- ❌ **Hopelessness**: "I'm useless," "I'll never work again"

**Medical**:

- ❌ **Non-Adherence**: Can't afford augmentation therapy without insurance (disease progression)
- ❌ **Stress**: Financial stress worsens health (inflammation, exacerbations)

**Foundation's Role**: Empower AATD patients to find meaningful, sustainable employment (compatible with disease, leverages strengths, provides income + insurance + purpose)

## Career Assessment

### Initial Consultation (60 Minutes, Free)

**What's Covered**:

1. **AATD Health Assessment**:
   - Lung function (FEV1—severe, moderate, mild impairment?)
   - Oxygen requirements (room air, PRN, continuous?)

   - Medical schedule (weekly infusions? frequent appointments?)

2. **Work History**:
   - Previous jobs (titles, responsibilities, why left?)
   - Skills (technical, soft skills—communication, leadership, problem-solving)
   - Strengths (what are you good at? what do you enjoy?)
   - Employment gaps (due to AATD—how to explain in interviews?)

3. **Career Goals**:
   - Ideal job (what do you want to do?)
   - Must-haves (salary, benefits, remote work, flexible schedule?)
   - Deal-breakers (physical labor? long commute? environmental triggers—dust, chemicals, smoke?)

4. **Barriers**:
   - What's preventing you from working? (health, discrimination, confidence, skills gap?)
   - What support do you need? (retraining, accommodations, job search help?)

**Deliverables**:

- Career Assessment Summary (written report—2-3 pages)
- Recommended careers (5-10 options compatible with patient's AATD + interests)

---

### Career Assessment Tools

**Vocational Interest Inventory**:

- Online questionnaire (20 min—based on Holland Code/RIASEC model)
- Identifies interests (realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, conventional)
- Matches interests to careers (e.g., "You scored high in Social + Investigative → consider healthcare, counseling, education")

**Skills Inventory**:

- Self-assessment (what skills do you have? technical, communication, leadership, creative, analytical?)
- Transferable skills (skills from previous jobs that apply to new careers)

**Physical Demands Analysis**:

- Rate physical requirements of target careers (lifting, standing, walking, fine motor skills, environmental exposures)
- Match patient's physical capabilities to job demands (avoid careers that exceed capabilities)

## AATD-Friendly Careers

### What Makes a Career "AATD-Friendly"?

**Criteria**:

- ✅ **Indoor, Clean Air**: Avoid dust, fumes, chemicals, smoke, allergens (trigger lung disease)
- ✅ **Sedentary or Light Physical Activity**: Avoid heavy lifting, prolonged standing, strenuous exertion
- ✅ **Flexible Schedule**: Accommodate weekly infusions, medical appointments, fatigue
- ✅ **Remote Work Option**: Work from home (reduce commute, control environment, use oxygen discreetly)
- ✅ **Cognitive Work**: Leverage brain, not brawn (AATD affects lungs, not mind—patients can excel in intellectual work)
- ✅ **Growth Potential**: Career with advancement opportunities (not dead-end)
- ✅ **Good Benefits**: Health insurance, paid leave, disability insurance (critical for AATD patients)

---

## Job Search Support

### Resume & Cover Letter Services

**Resume Review**:

- Professional career counselor reviews resume (30-60 min phone/video call)
- Feedback:
  - **Content**: Are skills, accomplishments clearly stated? Quantifiable results?
  - **Format**: Clean, professional, ATS-friendly (Applicant Tracking System—keyword optimization)?
  - **Employment Gaps**: How to address gaps due to AATD (be honest but brief—"medical leave," "health management")
  - **Accommodations**: Should you mention AATD on resume? (Usually NO—disclose after job offer, if at all)
- Edited resume (with track changes, suggestions)

**Cover Letter Template**:

- Sample cover letters for AATD patients (how to present strengths, address concerns without disclosing diagnosis prematurely)

**LinkedIn Profile Optimization**:

- Optimize LinkedIn for job search (professional photo, headline, summary, skills, recommendations)
- How to network on LinkedIn (connect with recruiters, join groups, engage with content)

---

### Interview Coaching

**Mock Interviews** (60 min, video call):

- Career counselor role-plays interviewer (asks common questions)
- Patient practices answers (record session—review together)
- Feedback (body language, tone, content, confidence)

**Common Interview Questions for AATD Patients**:

1. **"Tell me about yourself"**: How to structure answer (past, present, future—focus on professional strengths, not AATD)
2. **"Why did you leave your last job?"** (if left due to AATD): "I left to manage a health condition, which is now stable. I'm ready to return to work."
3. **"Can you work full-time?"**: If yes, say yes. If no, negotiate (part-time, flexible schedule—but wait until after offer)
4. **"Are you able to perform the essential functions of this job?"**: YES (with or without reasonable accommodations—don't elaborate unless asked)
5. **"Do you have any disabilities?"**: ILLEGAL question (but sometimes asked)—response: "I'm able to perform all essential job functions" (pivot to qualifications)

**Disclosure Strategy**:

- **When to disclose AATD**: After job offer (before starting) OR after starting (when requesting accommodations) OR never (if no accommodations needed)
- **How to disclose**: Brief, matter-of-fact ("I have a chronic lung condition that requires weekly medical treatment. I'll need flexible scheduling for appointments.")
- **What NOT to say**: Don't over-explain, apologize, or emphasize limitations (focus on what you CAN do, not what you can't)

---

## Workplace Navigation

### Requesting Reasonable Accommodations

**What Are Reasonable Accommodations?**:

- Modifications to job or work environment (enable employee with disability to perform job)
- **ADA**: Employers must provide (unless "undue hardship"—significant difficulty or expense)

**Common Accommodations for AATD Patients**:

1. **Flexible Schedule**: Start late/leave early for weekly infusions (4 hours/week)
2. **Work-from-Home**: 2-3 days/week (or full-time—reduce commute, control air quality, use oxygen privately)
3. **Modified Duties**: Eliminate heavy lifting, prolonged standing (reassign tasks)
4. **Breaks**: More frequent breaks (use inhaler, rest, oxygen)
5. **Parking**: Accessible parking spot (closer to building—reduce walking)
6. **Private Space**: Private office or cubicle (use oxygen, nebulizer without stigma)
7. **Leave**: Extended leave for transplant, exacerbations (FMLA + additional unpaid leave)

**How to Request Accommodations** (Step-by-Step):

**Step 1: Determine What You Need**:

- Identify barriers (what's preventing you from performing job?)
- Identify solutions (what accommodations would help?)

**Step 2: Submit Written Request**:

- Email or letter to supervisor + HR (document request)
- Template: "I have a medical condition that affects my ability to [task]. I am requesting a reasonable accommodation under the ADA: [specific accommodation]. Please let me know next steps."

**Step 3: Provide Medical Documentation** (If Requested):

- Employer may request documentation from doctor (confirming need for accommodation)
- Doctor's letter (brief—diagnosis, functional limitations, recommended accommodations)

**Step 4: Interactive Process**:

- ADA requires employer to engage in "interactive process" (discuss accommodations, find workable solution)
- Be flexible (employer may propose alternative accommodation—consider if meets your needs)

**Step 5: Approval & Implementation**:

- Employer approves accommodation (put in writing—email, letter)
- Accommodation implemented (monitor—is it working? need adjustments?)

**What If Employer Denies**?:

- Employer must prove "undue hardship" (significant difficulty or expense—high bar)
- If denied, contact Foundation's Legal Hotline (may have legal recourse—EEOC complaint, lawsuit)

---

### Navigating Workplace Disclosure

**To Disclose or Not to Disclose?**:

**Pros of Disclosing AATD**:

- ✅ Can request accommodations (without disclosure, can't invoke ADA protections)
- ✅ Reduces stress (don't have to hide illness, explain absences)
- ✅ May build trust (honesty with employer)

**Cons of Disclosing AATD**:

- ❌ Risk of discrimination (conscious or unconscious bias)
- ❌ May be passed over for promotions (perception of unreliability)
- ❌ Privacy loss (co-workers may find out, gossip)

**Foundation Recommendation**:

- **Disclose IF**: You need accommodations OR absences are noticeable (better to explain than leave employer guessing)
- **Don't Disclose IF**: AATD is well-controlled, no accommodations needed, no performance issues (why risk discrimination?)

**How to Disclose** (If Needed):

- **Who**: Supervisor + HR only (don't tell co-workers unless you choose to)
- **When**: After establishing yourself as competent employee (prove you can do job before disclosing) OR when requesting accommodation
- **What to Say**: Brief, factual, focus on solutions ("I have a genetic lung condition that requires weekly treatment. I'm requesting a flexible schedule to attend appointments. My performance won't be affected.")

## Career Transitions

### When to Change Careers (Due to AATD)

**Signs It's Time**:

- ❌ **Physical Demands Exceed Capability**: Job requires physical activity you can no longer perform (even with accommodations)
- ❌ **Environmental Triggers**: Workplace has poor air quality (dust, fumes, chemicals—employer can't/won't eliminate)
- ❌ **Employer Unwilling to Accommodate**: Requests denied, discriminatory treatment
- ❌ **Stress Worsening Health**: Job stress exacerbating AATD (consider lower-stress career)
- ❌ **Career No Longer Viable Long-Term**: Disease progression means current career unsustainable (e.g., firefighter with FEV1 40%—time to retrain)

---

### Career Transition Support

**Step 1: Grieve & Accept**:

- Leaving career (especially if you loved it) = grief (loss of identity, purpose)
- Counseling (acknowledge loss, process emotions, reframe as opportunity for new chapter)

**Step 2: Assess Transferable Skills**:

- What skills from old career apply to new career? (leadership, problem-solving, communication, technical skills)
- Example: Firefighter → Fire Inspector (uses knowledge, less physical), EMT → Medical Coder (uses medical knowledge, desk job)

**Step 3: Retraining/Education**:

- Identify skills gap (what do you need to learn for new career?)
- Training options:
  - **Community College**: Associate degree, certificate programs ($5K-$15K, 1-2 years)
  - **Online Courses**: Coursera, Udemy, LinkedIn Learning ($50-$500, self-paced)
  - **Bootcamps**: Intensive training (coding bootcamp, digital marketing—$5K-$20K, 3-6 months)
  - **On-the-Job Training**: Entry-level job with training (e.g., apprenticeship)
- **Funding**: State Vocational Rehabilitation (may pay for retraining), Pell Grants (if low income), Foundation scholarships (future)

**Step 4: Job Search** (See Job Search Support Above):

- Update resume (highlight transferable skills, explain career change in cover letter)
- Target entry-level jobs in new field (accept lower pay initially—invest in long-term career)

**Step 5: Adjust Expectations**:

- Career change = starting over (lower salary, junior role—temporary)
- Focus on trajectory (where will you be in 5 years? long-term viability more important than immediate pay)

---

- Free government program (every state has VR agency—helps people with disabilities get/keep jobs)
