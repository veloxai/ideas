## Why Financial Assistance Matters

### Financial Burden of AATD

**Statistics**:

- **Average annual AATD healthcare costs**: $50K-$150K (augmentation therapy, oxygen, medications, doctor visits, procedures)
- **Out-of-pocket costs**: $5K-$15K/year (after insurance—copays, deductibles, coinsurance)
- **Lost income**: $20K-$40K/year (due to disability, reduced work hours, missed work for medical appointments)
- **Total financial burden**: $25K-$55K/year (out-of-pocket costs + lost income)

**Financial Hardship Prevalence**:

- **40%** of AATD patients report financial hardship (difficulty paying medical bills)
- **25%** skip or delay medical care (due to cost)
- **20%** have medical debt (collections, bankruptcy)
- **60%** worry about affording future care (even if currently managing)

---

### Consequences of Financial Hardship

**Medical Consequences**:

- ❌ **Delayed Diagnosis**: Can't afford genetic testing ($200-$500 out-of-pocket if insurance denies)
- ❌ **Non-Adherence**: Skip augmentation therapy infusions (copays $50-$500 per infusion × 52 weeks = $2,600-$26K/year)
- ❌ **Disease Progression**: Skipping treatment → faster lung decline → hospitalization, transplant, death
- ❌ **Emergency Care**: Delay preventive care (can't afford specialist) → end up in ER (more expensive)

**Financial Consequences**:

- ❌ **Medical Debt**: Bills go to collections (credit score damage)
- ❌ **Bankruptcy**: 60% of bankruptcies in US are due to medical debt
- ❌ **Housing Insecurity**: Can't pay rent/mortgage (medical bills take priority)
- ❌ **Food Insecurity**: Choose between groceries and medications

**Psychological Consequences**:

- ❌ **Stress**: Constant worry about money (worsens health)
- ❌ **Depression**: Hopelessness ("I can't afford to stay alive")
- ❌ **Family Strain**: Relationships suffer (financial stress)

### Patient Stories (Why Emergency Fund Matters)

**Story 1: Single Mother, Denied Augmentation Therapy**:

- 38-year-old female, ZZ genotype, FEV1 55%, single mother (2 kids)
- Insurance initially denied augmentation therapy (prior authorization)
- Appeal in progress (takes 3-6 months)
- During appeal, must pay out-of-pocket ($4,000/infusion × 4 infusions = $16K)
- Can't afford → skips infusions → lung function drops to 48%
- **Foundation Grant**: $2,000 (covers copays for 4 infusions during appeal)
- **Outcome**: Stayed on treatment, appeal eventually approved, lung function stabilized at 50%

**Story 2: Transplant Patient, Needs Temporary Housing**:

- 55-year-old male, ZZ genotype, end-stage lung disease, on transplant list
- Must relocate to Miami (near Jackson Memorial Hospital—transplant center) for 6-12 weeks (pre-transplant monitoring)
- Lives in rural Georgia (5 hours away)
- Can't afford extended-stay hotel ($100/night × 60 days = $6,000)
- **Foundation Grant**: $3,000 (covers 1 month hotel—other housing options found for remaining time)
- **Outcome**: Patient able to stay near hospital, received lung transplant, alive today

**Story 3: Young Adult, Can't Afford Oxygen**:

- 28-year-old male, ZZ genotype, FEV1 40%, on oxygen 24/7
- Lost job (couldn't work due to disease) → lost insurance
- Can't afford oxygen rental ($300/month) or portable concentrator ($2,500 purchase)
- Tried to ration oxygen (only use at night) → hospitalized for hypoxemia
- **Foundation Grant**: $2,500 (purchased used portable oxygen concentrator)
- **Outcome**: Patient able to use oxygen 24/7, avoided future hospitalizations, eventually qualified for Medicaid (insurance restored)
