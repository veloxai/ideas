## Why This Service Matters

### Insurance Denials = #1 Barrier to AATD Care

**Statistics**:

- **68%** of AATD patients experience insurance denials (augmentation therapy, genetic testing, specialist visits)
- **Average delay**: 6-12 months from denial to approved appeal (if patient persists)
- **Appeals success rate**: 50-70% (if patient appeals—but only 20% actually appeal due to complexity)
- **Cost of denial**: Disease progression, hospitalization, lost work, emotional distress

**Common Denials**:

1. **Augmentation Therapy** (weekly IV infusions of AAT protein—$100K-$200K/year)
   - Denial reason: "Experimental," "not medically necessary," "no clinical evidence"
   - Reality: FDA-approved since 1987, endorsed by ATS/ERS clinical guidelines
2. **Genetic Testing** (confirm AATD diagnosis—$200-$500)
   - Denial reason: "Not covered," "screening test"
   - Reality: Diagnostic test (not screening), essential for treatment decisions
3. **Specialist Visits** (pulmonologist, hepatologist)
   - Denial reason: "Out-of-network," "requires prior authorization"
4. **Lung Transplant Evaluation** ($10K-$20K)
   - Denial reason: "Premature," "not medically necessary"
5. **Liver Biopsy** (for AATD liver disease)
   - Denial reason: "Not medically necessary"

**Why Patients Don't Appeal**:

- ❌ **Don't know they can** (assume denial is final)
- ❌ **Too complex** (appeals process is confusing, bureaucratic)
- ❌ **Too sick** (patients lack energy to fight insurance companies)
- ❌ **No resources** (can't afford attorney, don't know where to find help)

**Foundation's Role**: Level the playing field (give patients tools, expertise, support to win appeals)

---

## Common Insurance Denials

### Denial Type 1: Augmentation Therapy (Most Common)

**What It Is**:

- Weekly IV infusions of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin protein (replace deficient protein)
- Cost: $100K-$200K/year (lifetime therapy)
- FDA-approved products: Prolastin (Grifols), Zemaira (CSL Behring), Glassia (Takeda), Aralast (Baxter)

**Denial Reasons**:

1. **"Experimental/investigational"**
   - Counter: FDA-approved since 1987, 35+ years of use
2. **"Not medically necessary"**
   - Counter: ATS/ERS guidelines recommend for patients with FEV1 < 65% + documented lung disease
3. **"No clinical evidence of efficacy"**
   - Counter: Multiple studies show slowed lung disease progression (RAPID, RAPID-OLE trials)
4. **"Patient doesn't meet criteria"**
   - Counter: Patient has documented AATD (genotype ZZ, SZ, etc.) + lung disease + FEV1 < 65%

**Appeals Strategy**:

- Provide clinical guidelines (ATS/ERS 2003, updated 2016)
- Submit lung function tests (spirometry showing FEV1 < 65%)
- Include CT scan (showing emphysema)
- Expert letter from pulmonologist (medical necessity)
- Peer-reviewed research (RAPID trial data)

---

### Denial Type 2: Genetic Testing

**What It Is**:

- Blood test to confirm AATD genotype (ZZ, SZ, MZ, etc.)
- Cost: $200-$500
- Essential for diagnosis + treatment decisions

**Denial Reasons**:

1. **"Screening test" (not diagnostic)**
   - Counter: Ordered due to symptoms (low AAT level, COPD, liver disease)—diagnostic, not screening
2. **"Not covered benefit"**
   - Counter: Genetic testing is covered for diagnostic purposes (not screening)

**Appeals Strategy**:

- Provide documentation of symptoms (low AAT level < 100 mg/dL, COPD, family history)
- Letter from physician (ordered for diagnostic purposes, not screening)
- CPT codes (use correct codes: 81332 for full sequencing, 81479 for targeted mutation analysis)

---

### Denial Type 3: Out-of-Network Specialist

**What It Is**:

- Patient needs AATD specialist (few experts nationwide)
- Nearest in-network pulmonologist has no AATD expertise

**Denial Reasons**:

1. **"Out-of-network provider" (patient must use in-network)**
   - Counter: No in-network provider with AATD expertise (gap exception)

**Appeals Strategy**:

- Document lack of in-network AATD experts (search plan directory, call in-network providers)
- Request "gap exception" (out-of-network provider at in-network rates)
- Letter from specialist (confirming specialized expertise required)

---

### Denial Type 4: Prior Authorization Denials

**What It Is**:

- Insurance requires prior authorization (PA) before approving treatment
- PA often denied initially (even for FDA-approved therapies)

**Denial Reasons**:

1. **"Incomplete documentation"**
   - Counter: Resubmit with all required documentation
2. **"Does not meet medical necessity criteria"**
   - Counter: Provide clinical guidelines, research, expert opinion

**Appeals Strategy**:

- Understand plan's specific PA criteria (request in writing)
- Submit comprehensive packet (all required documentation upfront)
- Peer-to-peer review (physician-to-physician discussion with plan medical director)

[Address]

RE: Appeal of Denial for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Augmentation Therapy
Member Name: [Patient Name]
Member ID: [ID Number]
Claim Number: [Claim #]
Date of Denial: [Date]

Dear Appeals Reviewer:

I am writing to appeal your denial of coverage for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation
therapy for [Patient Name]. This therapy is medically necessary, FDA-approved, and recommended
by clinical guidelines. I respectfully request that you overturn this denial.

PATIENT BACKGROUND:
[Patient Name] is a [age]-year-old [gender] diagnosed with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency
(AATD), genotype [ZZ/SZ/etc.]. [He/She] has documented lung disease (emphysema) with
FEV1 [percentage]% predicted. [Brief medical history—symptoms, diagnosis, current condition].

REASON FOR DENIAL:
Your denial letter states that augmentation therapy is "[denied as experimental/not medically
necessary/etc.]." This is incorrect, and I provide the following evidence:

1. FDA APPROVAL:
AAT augmentation therapy has been FDA-approved since 1987. Currently approved products include:
   - Prolastin (Grifols) - approved 1987
   - Zemaira (CSL Behring) - approved 2003
   - Glassia (Takeda) - approved 2010
   - Aralast (Baxter) - approved 2002

This therapy is NOT experimental. It has been used safely and effectively for 35+ years.

2. CLINICAL GUIDELINES:
The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) jointly published
clinical guidelines recommending augmentation therapy for AATD patients who meet specific
criteria (attached). [Patient Name] meets these criteria:
   ✓ Confirmed AATD diagnosis (AAT level < 11 µM, genotype ZZ)
   ✓ Evidence of lung disease (emphysema on CT scan)
   ✓ FEV1 between 35-65% predicted
   ✓ Non-smoker (or former smoker, quit [date])

3. MEDICAL NECESSITY:
Without augmentation therapy, [Patient Name]'s lung disease will progress rapidly. Studies
show that augmentation therapy slows lung function decline by approximately 50% (RAPID trial,
NEJM 2015—attached). This therapy is the ONLY treatment that addresses the underlying cause
of AATD lung disease.

[Patient Name]'s pulmonologist, Dr. [Name], has confirmed that augmentation therapy is
medically necessary (letter attached).

4. INSURANCE POLICY COVERAGE:
Your policy states that [quote relevant policy language showing coverage for FDA-approved
therapies]. AAT augmentation therapy meets this definition.

CONCLUSION:
I respectfully request that you overturn this denial and approve coverage for AAT augmentation
therapy. This therapy is FDA-approved, clinically proven, recommended by medical guidelines,
and essential to prevent irreversible lung damage.

I am available to provide additional information or to participate in a peer-to-peer review.
Please contact me at [phone] or [email].

Thank you for your prompt attention to this urgent matter.

Sincerely,

[Patient Name or Physician Name]
[Contact Information]

- ATS/ERS Clinical Guidelines (2003, 2016)
- RAPID Trial Publication (NEJM 2015)
- FDA Approval Letters (Prolastin, Zemaira, Glassia, Aralast)

### Template 2: Genetic Testing Appeal Letter

```
[Date]

[Insurance Company Name]
Appeals Department
[Address]

RE: Appeal of Denial for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Genetic Testing
Member Name: [Patient Name]
Member ID: [ID Number]
Claim Number: [Claim #]
Date of Denial: [Date]

Dear Appeals Reviewer:

I am writing to appeal your denial of coverage for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) genetic testing.
This test was ordered for DIAGNOSTIC purposes (not screening) and is medically necessary.

REASON FOR TEST:
[Patient Name] has symptoms and clinical findings suggestive of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency:
   - Low AAT serum level ([value] mg/dL, normal range 100-200 mg/dL)
   - [COPD/emphysema/liver disease]
   - [Family history of AATD/early-onset emphysema/liver disease]

The genetic test (CPT code 81332) was ordered to CONFIRM THE DIAGNOSIS, not for screening.
This is a diagnostic test, just like ordering an MRI to confirm a herniated disk or a biopsy
to confirm cancer.

MEDICAL NECESSITY:
Without genetic testing, we cannot:
   1. Confirm AATD diagnosis (need genotype, not just low AAT level)
   2. Determine treatment eligibility (augmentation therapy requires confirmed genotype)
   3. Counsel patient on prognosis (different genotypes = different disease severity)
   4. Screen family members (first-degree relatives should be tested)

INSURANCE POLICY COVERAGE:
Your policy states that genetic testing is covered when medically necessary for diagnosis.
This test meets that criterion.

CONCLUSION:
I respectfully request that you overturn this denial and approve coverage for AAT genetic
testing. This is a diagnostic test (not screening) and is essential for appropriate medical
management.

Sincerely,

[Patient Name or Physician Name]
[Contact Information]
