## Why Travel Assistance Matters

### Geographic Barriers to AATD Care

**Statistics**:

- **~50 AATD specialists** nationwide (pulmonologists with deep AATD expertise)
- **~15 AATD Centers of Excellence** (National Jewish Health, Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
- **Average distance to AATD specialist**: 200+ miles (for rural patients)
- **50% of AATD patients** live > 100 miles from specialist

**Consequences**:

- ❌ **Delayed Diagnosis**: Local doctors miss AATD (not familiar) → patient must travel to specialist for diagnosis
- ❌ **Suboptimal Treatment**: Patients don't see specialists → not started on augmentation therapy, not monitored properly
- ❌ **No Access to Clinical Trials**: Trials concentrated at research centers (Boston, Denver, SF) → patients can't participate (too far)
- ❌ **Transplant Barriers**: Lung/liver transplant centers require 6-12 weeks on-site (pre/post-transplant monitoring) → patients can't afford extended stay

---

### Financial Barriers

**Cost of Medical Travel** (Example: Rural Montana → Denver for specialist):

- **Round-trip flight**: $400-$800 (Montana → Denver)
- **Hotel**: $150/night × 2 nights = $300
- **Meals**: $50/day × 3 days = $150
- **Rental car**: $50/day × 3 days = $150
- **Parking**: $30/day × 3 days = $90
- **Total**: $1,090-$1,490 (per trip)
- **Frequency**: Quarterly visits (4x/year) = $4,360-$5,960/year

**For Transplant** (Patient must relocate to Miami for 12 weeks):

- **Airfare**: $400 (one-way—family driving patient)
- **Hotel**: $100/night × 84 nights = $8,400
- **Meals**: $50/day × 84 days = $4,200
- **Parking**: $20/day × 84 days = $1,680
- **Caregiver lost wages**: $15/hour × 40 hours/week × 12 weeks = $7,200
- **Total**: $21,880 (3 months)

**Many AATD Patients Can't Afford This** → skip specialist visits, don't get transplant, die unnecessarily

---

### Patient Stories

**Story 1: Skipped Specialist Visits → Disease Progression**:

- 52-year-old male, ZZ genotype, FEV1 55%, rural Wyoming (300 miles to Denver specialist)
- Can't afford quarterly trips ($1,500 each) → only sees specialist annually
- Between visits, lung function drops (FEV1 55% → 42%)
- Hospitalized for exacerbation (could have been prevented with better monitoring)
- **Foundation Grant**: $3,000/year (cover quarterly trips) → patient now sees specialist every 3 months → lung function stabilized

**Story 2: Clinical Trial Travel**:

- 38-year-old female, ZZ genotype, FEV1 65%, eligible for gene therapy trial (Boston)
- Lives in rural Florida (1,200 miles from Boston)
- Trial requires 15 visits over 2 years (flights + hotels = $30K total)
- Can't afford → almost declined trial participation (would miss chance at cure)
- **Foundation Grant**: $10K ($2,500/year × 4 years—max per patient) + additional fundraising → patient enrolled in trial → receiving potentially curative therapy

**Story 3: Transplant Relocation**:

- 55-year-old male, end-stage AATD, on lung transplant list
- Must relocate to Miami (Jackson Memorial—transplant center) for 12 weeks (pre-transplant monitoring)
- Lives in rural Georgia (family of 4—wife + 2 kids)
- Can't afford $22K for 3-month stay → considering declining transplant (death sentence)
- **Foundation Housing**: Free accommodation at Foundation-sponsored transplant house (12 weeks) + $2,500 travel grant (gas, food) → patient able to get transplant → alive today

### Free Lodging (Transplant Housing)

**Target Locations** (Year 1—2 Facilities):

**1. Miami, FL** (Jackson Memorial—lung transplant):

- **Property**: Rent or purchase 3-bedroom house (near hospital—within 5 miles)
- **Capacity**: 3 patient families (12-15 people total—patients + caregivers)
- **Amenities**: Kitchen, laundry, shared living areas, private bedrooms (per family)
- **Cost**: $3K/month rent (or $500K purchase) + $1K/month utilities/maintenance = $48K/year operating cost

**2. Cleveland, OH** (Cleveland Clinic—lung/liver transplant):

- Same model as Miami

**Who Qualifies**:

**Expansion** (Year 5): 10 facilities (every major transplant center)

---

## Transportation Coordination

### Airport Shuttle Service

**Problem**: Patients arrive at airport (need ride to hotel/hospital—Uber expensive, $30-$50)

**Solution**: Foundation contracts with shuttle service (group shuttle—patients share ride)

**Cost**: $10/person (one-way airport → hotel/hospital)—Foundation covers

**Availability**: Denver, Cleveland, Rochester, Boston, Miami (Year 1)

---

### Medical Transport (For Patients Who Can't Fly)

**Scenarios**:

- Patient on continuous oxygen (can't fly—airlines restrict oxygen concentrators)
- Patient too ill to fly (severe lung disease, post-surgery)
- Patient needs wheelchair-accessible transport

**Options**:

**1. Ground Ambulance** (Non-Emergency Medical Transport):

- Wheelchair-accessible van (patient reclines, oxygen available)
- Cost: $2-$5/mile (e.g., 300 miles = $600-$1,500)
- Foundation covers (if financial need)

**2. Medical Air Ambulance** (Extreme Cases):

- Air ambulance with medical team (nurse, respiratory therapist, oxygen)
- Cost: $20K-$50K (very expensive—reserved for emergencies)
- Foundation may contribute (but typically insurance covers—or patient's out-of-pocket max)

---

### Oxygen Coordination

**Problem**: Patients on supplemental oxygen (need oxygen at destination—can't bring own concentrator on plane)

**Solution**: Foundation coordinates oxygen delivery (to hotel or patient's home at destination)

**Process**:

1. Patient notifies Foundation (2 weeks before travel)
2. Foundation contacts local DME supplier (at destination)
3. DME delivers portable oxygen concentrator (to hotel or patient's destination address)
4. Patient uses oxygen during stay (rental $50-$100/week)
5. Patient returns concentrator (before leaving—DME picks up)
6. Foundation covers cost (if not covered by patient's insurance)

---

## Travel Companions

### Caregiver Travel Grants

**Who Needs Travel Companions**:

- Elderly patients (need help navigating airport, medical appointments)
- Severely ill patients (on oxygen, wheelchair-bound, post-surgery)
- Pediatric patients (parents must accompany)
- Transplant patients (require 24/7 caregiver support)

**Caregiver Travel Grant**:

- Foundation covers 1 caregiver's travel expenses (flight, hotel, meals)
- Same limits as patient ($2,500/year)
- Must demonstrate necessity (doctor's letter—patient requires caregiver)

---

## Transplant Relocation Support

### Extended Stay Support (6-12 Weeks)

**Why Transplant Patients Need Extended Stay**:

- **Pre-Transplant Monitoring** (4-8 weeks): Must live near hospital (on transplant list—can receive call at any time, must arrive within hours)
- **Post-Transplant Recovery** (4-8 weeks): Must stay near hospital (frequent follow-ups, monitor for rejection, complications)
- **Total**: 8-16 weeks on-site

**Foundation Support**:

**1. Free Lodging** (Foundation Transplant House):

- Patient + 2 caregivers (12 weeks, no cost)
- Near transplant center (< 5 miles)

**2. Travel Grant** ($2,500):

- Gas (drive to transplant city)
- Meals (per diem $50/day × 84 days = $4,200—Foundation covers $2,500, patient covers rest or applies for additional assistance)

**3. Grocery Stipend** ($500/month × 3 months = $1,500):

- Reimburse grocery expenses (receipts required)
- Supplement for families (save money vs. eating out)

**4. Utility Assistance**:

- Help pay home utility bills (while patient is away—so home doesn't go into foreclosure, utilities aren't shut off)

**5. Caregiver Support**:

- Respite care (volunteers give caregiver a break—4 hours/week, so caregiver can run errands, rest)
- Support group (for caregivers—weekly meetings at transplant house)

**Total Support** (Per Transplant Patient): ~$10K-$15K (free lodging $7K + travel grant $2,500 + grocery $1,500 + utilities $500)
