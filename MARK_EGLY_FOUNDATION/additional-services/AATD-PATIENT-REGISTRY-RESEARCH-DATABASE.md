## Why a Patient Registry Matters

### Current Research Limitations

**Problem**: AATD is rare (1 in 2,500) → small patient populations → hard to study

**Consequences**:

- ❌ **Clinical trials take years to enroll** (need 100+ patients, but AATD Centers see only 50-100 patients total—recruiting nationwide takes 2-5 years)
- ❌ **Natural history unknown** (don't know how fast disease progresses, which patients decline fastest, why some patients stable for decades while others need transplant in 5 years)
- ❌ **Treatment gaps** (don't know optimal age to start augmentation, whether SZ patients benefit, if inhaled AAT works)
- ❌ **Disparities hidden** (don't track outcomes by race, geography, income—can't address inequities)

---

### How Registries Accelerate Research

**Examples from Other Diseases**:

**Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry** (established 1966):

- Tracks 30,000+ CF patients (90% of US CF population)
- Data collected annually (lung function, treatments, complications)
- **Impact**:
  - Identified best treatments (Trikafta approval—registry data showed efficacy)
  - Improved survival (median survival age: 10 years in 1960s → 47 years today—registry data guided treatment improvements)
  - 100+ publications/year using registry data

**Michael J. Fox Foundation Parkinson's Registry**:

- Tracks 50,000+ Parkinson's patients
- Enabled 200+ clinical trials (fast recruitment—contact patients by email, enroll in weeks vs. years)
- Identified biomarkers (predict disease progression)

**AATD Can Do the Same**—but we need the registry first.

---

### Current AATD Registries (Inadequate)

**Alpha-1 Foundation Research Registry**:

- Established 1997
- ~3,000 patients enrolled
- **Limitations**:
  - Only 15% of US AATD patients enrolled (low penetration)
  - Data collected once (at enrollment—no longitudinal follow-up)
  - Limited data elements (~30—need 100+ for comprehensive research)
  - No EHR integration (patients manually enter data—inaccurate, incomplete)

**Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) AATD Registry**:

- ~2,500 patients
- Similar limitations (one-time enrollment, limited follow-up)

**Mark Egly Foundation Registry Will Be Superior**:

- ✅ **Larger**: Goal 25,000 patients (10x current registries)
- ✅ **Longitudinal**: Annual updates (track disease progression over time)
- ✅ **Comprehensive**: 100+ data elements (genetics, lung, liver, treatments, outcomes, quality of life)
- ✅ **EHR-Integrated**: Auto-populate from medical records (accurate, complete, real-time)

### Patient Stories

**Story 1: Clinical Trial Recruitment**:

- **Before Registry**: Gene therapy trial needs 50 ZZ patients (FEV1 40-60%, age 30-50). Took 3 years to recruit (researchers contacted AATD centers, centers screened patients 1-by-1—slow, expensive).
- **With Registry**: Search registry database (filter: ZZ, FEV1 40-60%, age 30-50) → identify 200 eligible patients → email patients → 50 enrolled in 3 months (20x faster)

**Story 2: Natural History Study**:

- **Before Registry**: Researcher wants to study lung function decline in SZ patients (do SZ patients need augmentation therapy?). No data available (most studies only include ZZ—SZ patients excluded). Can't answer question.
- **With Registry**: Query registry (filter: SZ, lung function data) → analyze 500 SZ patients → find that 20% of SZ patients with FEV1 < 50% decline as fast as ZZ → **New Discovery**: Some SZ patients may benefit from augmentation therapy (change clinical practice)

**Story 3: Health Equity**:

- **Before Registry**: No data on racial disparities in AATD (most research on white patients—minorities underrepresented).
- **With Registry**: Analyze 10,000 patients by race → **Discovery**: Black AATD patients diagnosed 5 years later than white patients (doctors less likely to test), have worse outcomes (FEV1 10% lower at diagnosis). Foundation launches targeted screening program (Black communities) → earlier diagnosis → better outcomes.

## Data Collection

### Enrollment Process

**Step 1: Patient Consents**:

- Go to MarkEglyFoundation.org/Registry OR call 1-800-AATD-REG
- Read consent form (explains what registry is, how data used, privacy protections)
- E-sign consent (HIPAA authorization—allow registry to access medical records)

**Step 2: Baseline Survey** (30-45 min—complete at enrollment):

- **Demographics**: Age, sex, race/ethnicity, zip code, education, income
- **AATD Diagnosis**: Genotype (ZZ, SZ, MZ, rare), AAT level, age at diagnosis, family history
- **Lung Disease**: FEV1, DLCO, CT scan results (emphysema, bronchiectasis), symptoms (dyspnea scale), exacerbations (# per year), hospitalizations

**Step 3: Medical Records Release**:

- Patient authorizes registry to request medical records (from pulmonologist, hepatologist, PCP)
- Registry staff reviews records (extract data—lung function tests, lab results, imaging, hospitalizations)
- Data entered into registry database (de-identified—patient assigned ID number)

**Step 4: Annual Follow-Up**:

- Every 12 months, patient receives email/phone call (update information)
- Short survey (15 min—any changes? New treatments? Hospitalizations? Lung function tests?)
- Medical records updated (registry requests new records from doctors)

**Ongoing**:

- Patients can update anytime (report new diagnosis, treatment change, hospitalization)
- Registry sends reminders (email, text—"Time for your annual update!")

---

## Registry Uses

### 1. Natural History Studies

**Goal**: Understand how AATD progresses over time

**Questions Registry Can Answer**:

- How fast does lung function decline in ZZ vs. SZ vs. MZ patients?
- What predicts rapid decline (genetics, smoking, environmental factors)?
- At what FEV1 do patients typically develop respiratory failure (need transplant)?
- Does augmentation therapy slow decline (real-world data—not just clinical trials)?

**Example Study**:

- Analyze 5,000 ZZ patients (10 years of data)
- **Findings**: Average FEV1 decline = 50 mL/year (without augmentation), 30 mL/year (with augmentation) → **Conclusion**: Augmentation therapy slows decline by 40%
- **Impact**: Stronger evidence for augmentation therapy → more insurance approvals

---

### 2. Treatment Effectiveness (Real-World Evidence)

**Goal**: Show what works in real-world patients (not just clinical trial participants)

**Questions**:

- Does augmentation therapy improve survival (long-term, 20+ years)?
- Do inhalers improve symptoms (quality of life)?
- Does pulmonary rehab reduce hospitalizations?
- Which oxygen therapy regimen is best (continuous vs. PRN)?

**Example Study**:

- Compare 1,000 patients on augmentation therapy vs. 1,000 not on therapy (matched by FEV1, age, smoking)
- **Findings**: Augmentation patients live 5 years longer, have 50% fewer hospitalizations
- **Impact**: Publish in NEJM → FDA approves label expansion (augmentation for SZ patients)

---

### 3. Biomarker Discovery

**Goal**: Identify blood tests, imaging markers that predict disease progression

**Questions**:

- Can we predict which patients will decline rapidly (before FEV1 drops)?
- Are there biomarkers for exacerbations (predict who will get hospitalized)?
- Can imaging (CT densitometry) replace FEV1 (more sensitive, earlier detection of progression)?

**Example Study**:

- Measure 50 blood biomarkers in 500 patients (at baseline, then track 5 years)
- **Findings**: High CRP + low albumin = 3x risk of rapid decline
- **Impact**: Doctors can identify high-risk patients earlier → start augmentation therapy sooner

---

### 4. Health Equity Research

**Goal**: Identify and address disparities in AATD care

**Questions**:

- Are minority patients diagnosed later than white patients?
- Do rural patients have worse outcomes (less access to specialists)?
- Do low-income patients receive augmentation therapy (or skip due to cost)?

**Example Study**:

- Analyze 10,000 patients by race, income, geography
- **Findings**: Black patients diagnosed 5 years later, have 15% lower FEV1 at diagnosis (vs. white patients)
- **Impact**: Foundation launches targeted screening program (Black churches, community clinics) → earlier diagnosis

---

### 5. Quality Improvement

**Goal**: Improve AATD care delivery

**Questions**:

- What % of AATD patients receive augmentation therapy (vs. should receive)?
- What % see pulmonologist annually (vs. PCP only)?
- What % get family testing (cascade testing)?

**Example Study**:

- Analyze 5,000 ZZ patients (FEV1 < 65%—augmentation indicated)
- **Findings**: Only 60% receive augmentation therapy (40% not receiving indicated treatment)
- **Impact**: Foundation launches education campaign (doctors + patients) → increase treatment rate to 80%

---

## Clinical Trial Recruitment

### Fast Recruitment Pipeline

**Problem**: Clinical trials take years to enroll (slow, expensive, delays new treatments)

**Solution**: Registry = pre-screened patient pool (researchers can contact eligible patients instantly)

---

### How It Works

**Step 1: Trial Posts Eligibility Criteria**:

- Researcher contacts Foundation (want to recruit for gene therapy trial)
- Criteria: ZZ genotype, FEV1 40-60%, age 30-50, no liver disease, non-smoker

**Step 2: Registry Searches Database**:

- Query registry (filter by criteria)
- Identify 200 eligible patients (from 10,000 in registry)

**Step 3: Contact Patients**:

- Send email to 200 patients (trial invitation—brief description, eligibility, how to enroll)
- Interested patients click link → screened by trial site (confirm eligibility)
- 50 patients enrolled (3 months—vs. 3 years traditional recruitment)

**Step 4: Track Outcomes**:

- Registry follows trial participants (collect outcomes—did trial help?)
- Long-term follow-up (after trial ends—track survival, lung function 5-10 years post-treatment)

---

### Benefits for Trials

**Faster Recruitment**: 3 months vs. 3 years (10x faster)

**Cost Savings**: Traditional recruitment costs $5K-$10K per patient (advertising, screening, travel reimbursement). Registry recruitment: $500 per patient (just email, screening)—90% cost reduction

**Better Enrollment**: Higher % of contacted patients enroll (registry patients pre-consented, motivated to participate in research)

**Diverse Enrollment**: Registry tracks race, geography → can recruit minorities, rural patients (improve trial diversity—FDA priority)

---

### Year 1 Goal: 5 Trials Recruit from Registry

**Target Trials**:

- Gene therapy (AAV, CRISPR)
- Inhaled AAT (easier than IV)
- Anti-fibrotic drugs (for liver disease)
- Biomarker studies (predict decline)
- Quality of life interventions (pulmonary rehab, mental health)

---
