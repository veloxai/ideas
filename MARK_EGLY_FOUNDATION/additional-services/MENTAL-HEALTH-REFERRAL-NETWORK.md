## Why Mental Health Matters in AATD

### High Rates of Depression & Anxiety

**Statistics**:

- **60% of AATD patients** experience depression (vs. 7% general population—8x higher)
- **70% of AATD patients** experience anxiety (vs. 19% general population—3.5x higher)
- **40% of AATD patients** report suicidal thoughts at some point after diagnosis
- **25% of AATD patients** meet criteria for PTSD (trauma from diagnosis, medical procedures, near-death experiences)

**Risk Factors**:

- **Chronic illness burden**: Daily symptoms (shortness of breath, fatigue), treatment adherence (weekly infusions, daily medications), medical appointments (frequent), hospitalizations (exacerbations, complications)
- **Genetic guilt**: "I passed this to my children" (75% of ZZ parents feel guilt)
- **Uncertain prognosis**: "Will I need a transplant?" "How long will I live?" (fear of death, disability)
- **Social isolation**: Rare disease (few people understand), physical limitations (can't keep up with friends, miss social events)
- **Financial stress**: Medical bills, lost wages (disability, reduced work hours), insurance battles (denials, appeals)

---

### Consequences of Untreated Mental Health Issues

**Medical**:

- ❌ **Poor treatment adherence**: Depressed patients skip augmentation therapy (40% non-adherent—vs. 15% non-depressed patients)
- ❌ **Worse health outcomes**: Depression = faster lung function decline (FEV1 drops 30% faster in depressed patients—likely due to non-adherence, smoking, inactivity)
- ❌ **Higher mortality**: AATD patients with depression die 5 years earlier (on average—vs. non-depressed patients)

**Quality of Life**:

- ❌ **Severe functional impairment**: Can't work, can't care for family, can't enjoy life
- ❌ **Substance abuse**: 30% of depressed AATD patients turn to alcohol, drugs (self-medication)
- ❌ **Suicide**: 5% of AATD patients attempt suicide (vs. 1% general population—5x higher)

**Social**:

- ❌ **Relationship breakdown**: Depression strains marriages (40% of AATD patients report marital problems—linked to depression)
- ❌ **Social withdrawal**: Patients isolate (stop answering phone, skip family events, lose friendships)

---

### Mental Health Treatment Works

**Research**:

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** reduces depression by 50% (in COPD patients—AATD similar)
- **Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT)** improves quality of life by 30% (helps patients accept diagnosis, live with uncertainty)
- **Antidepressants** effective in 60-70% of patients (SSRIs, SNRIs)
- **Support groups** reduce anxiety by 40% (peer support, normalization of experiences)

**But AATD Patients Aren't Getting Help**:

- **Only 20% of AATD patients** with depression receive treatment (80% untreated)
- **Barriers**: Stigma ("I should be strong"), lack of providers (especially chronic illness specialists), cost (therapy expensive, $150-$300/session), geographic access (rural patients—no local therapists)

**Foundation's Referral Network Eliminates These Barriers**

---

### Patient Stories

**Story 1: Depression After Diagnosis**:

- 42-year-old female, ZZ AATD, diagnosed 1 year ago (FEV1 55%)
- Initially coped well (started augmentation therapy, quit smoking, optimistic)
- 6 months later: Can't get out of bed, crying daily, stopped seeing friends, skipping infusions (non-adherent)
- Husband notices (concerned), encourages her to seek help (she resists—"I'm fine, just tired")
- **Foundation Intervention**: Patient Navigator calls (routine check-in), patient admits struggling → Navigator refers to therapist (in network, near patient's home, specializes in chronic illness)
- **Outcome**: Patient completes 12 sessions CBT → depression resolves (PHQ-9 score drops from 18 to 5), resumes infusions (adherent), re-engages with life (back to work, socializing)

**Story 2: Anxiety & Medical Trauma**:

- 55-year-old male, ZZ AATD, post-lung transplant (2 years ago)
- Physically recovered (FEV1 70%, walking 3 miles/day), but mentally struggling
- Flashbacks to ICU (intubation, near-death experiences), panic attacks (triggered by medical appointments), hypervigilance (checks oxygen levels 20x/day, convinced rejection is happening)
- Meets criteria for PTSD (medical trauma)
- **Foundation Referral**: Referred to trauma therapist (EMDR specialist—Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing)
- **Outcome**: 8 sessions EMDR → PTSD symptoms reduce by 70% (PCL-5 score drops from 45 to 15), panic attacks stop, returns to normal activities (stops obsessing over oxygen levels)

**Story 3: Caregiver Burnout**:

- Wife of AATD patient (husband end-stage, on oxygen, awaiting transplant)
- Providing 24/7 care (administering medications, managing oxygen equipment, driving to appointments, cooking, cleaning)
- Exhausted, depressed, resentful (loves husband but feels trapped)
- No time for herself (hasn't seen friends in months, stopped exercising, not sleeping)
- **Foundation Referral**: Caregiver calls Foundation (crying, at breaking point) → Navigator refers to therapist (specializes in caregiver burnout)
- **Outcome**: Weekly therapy (learns self-care strategies, sets boundaries, processes emotions) + peer support group (connects with other caregivers) → burnout reduces, feels supported, able to continue caregiving without sacrificing own health

## Provider Network

### Therapist Recruitment

**Eligibility Criteria**:

- ✅ Licensed (psychologist, LCSW, LPC, LMFT—state-licensed)
- ✅ Experience with chronic illness (COPD, cancer, heart disease, rare diseases—understand medical context)
- ✅ Evidence-based modalities (CBT, ACT, EMDR, DBT—not "crystal healing" or pseudoscience)

2. **Application**: Therapist submits application (credentials, experience, insurance, teletherapy availability)
3. **Vetting**: Foundation staff reviews (verify license, check references, assess fit)
4. **Training**: 2-hour webinar (AATD basics—genetics, symptoms, treatment, psychological impact—so therapists understand disease)
5. **Directory Listing**: Therapist added to Foundation website (searchable directory—patients can find by zip code, insurance, specialty)

**Year 1 Goal**: 100 therapists recruited (50 states—at least 1 per state, concentration in major cities, some rural coverage)

---

### Provider Directory (Website)

---

## Referral Process

### Step 1: Patient Contacts Foundation

**How**:

- **Phone**: 1-800-AATD-MIND (Patient Navigator answers, conducts intake)
- **Online**: Fill out form (MarkEglyFoundation.org/MentalHealth—brief questionnaire)
- **Automatic**: Patient participates in other Foundation program (Patient Navigation, Travel Assistance, Peer Counseling) → staff identifies mental health needs → offers referral

**Intake Questions** (10-15 min):

- Name, contact info, location (to match to local therapist)
- AATD diagnosis (genotype, stage, treatments—context for therapist)
- Mental health concerns (depression, anxiety, trauma, grief, relationship issues, caregiver burnout)
- Current symptoms (PHQ-9 depression screener, GAD-7 anxiety screener—assess severity)
- Insurance (to match to therapists who accept)
- Preferences (teletherapy vs. in-person, gender of therapist, modality preference—if any)
- Urgency (crisis—suicidal, severe symptoms—vs. routine—want ongoing therapy support)

---

### Step 2: Navigator Matches Patient to Therapist

**Matching Criteria**:

- Geographic proximity (if in-person)
- Insurance (accept patient's insurance—or sliding scale if uninsured/underinsured)
- Specialty (chronic illness, depression, anxiety, trauma—match to patient's needs)
- Availability (therapist has openings—not 6-month waitlist)

**Navigator Provides**:

- 3 therapist options (profiles, contact info)
- Warm introduction (Navigator calls therapist, says "I'm referring [patient name], here's their situation"—so therapist is prepared)

---

### Step 3: Patient Contacts Therapist

**Patient Calls Therapist**:

- Schedules first session (within 1-2 weeks—timely access)
- Mentions Foundation referral ("Mark Egly Foundation referred me—I'm eligible for free first session")

**First Session** (60 min):

- Therapist conducts assessment (understand patient's mental health, AATD context, goals)
- Patient assesses fit (do I feel comfortable with this therapist? do they understand chronic illness?)
- Discuss ongoing therapy plan (frequency—weekly, biweekly; modality—CBT, ACT; goals—reduce depression, improve coping)

**Foundation Covers First Session** ($150):

- Therapist bills Foundation (invoice—patient name, session date, fee)
- Foundation pays therapist (within 30 days)
- Removes financial barrier (patient can "test drive" therapy—no upfront cost)

---

### Step 4: Ongoing Therapy

**If Good Fit**:

- Patient continues therapy (weekly, biweekly—typically 10-20 sessions for depression/anxiety)
- Patient uses insurance (therapist bills insurance—patient pays copay)
- If financial hardship: Foundation offers sliding scale assistance (see Financial Assistance section)

**If Not Good Fit**:

- Patient can try another therapist (Navigator helps—re-match to different provider)
- No penalty (first session still free—can use benefit again with new therapist)

---

### Crisis Referrals (Urgent)

**Red Flags** (During Intake):

- Suicidal thoughts with plan ("I'm going to kill myself tonight")
- Severe depression (PHQ-9 > 20—severe range)
- Psychosis (hallucinations, delusions—rare but can occur)
- Acute trauma (just witnessed death, violent event)

**Navigator Actions**:

- **Immediate**: Connect to crisis hotline (988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline—if imminent danger)
- **Same-Day**: Arrange crisis assessment (ER psychiatric evaluation, mobile crisis team)
- **Next-Day**: Urgent therapy appointment (therapist sees patient within 24 hours—crisis slot)

---

## Therapy Modalities

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

**How It Works**:

- **Premise**: Thoughts → Feelings → Behaviors (change negative thoughts → improve mood, behavior)
- **Techniques**: Identify negative thoughts ("I'll never get better", "I'm a burden"), challenge them (evidence for/against), replace with realistic thoughts ("I'm managing my illness", "My family loves me")

**Applications in AATD**:

- **Depression**: Challenge hopelessness ("I have no future" → "I can still have meaningful life with AATD")
- **Anxiety**: Challenge catastrophizing ("I'm going to die" → "I have treatment, many AATD patients live long lives")
- **Non-adherence**: Identify barriers (e.g., "Infusions don't work" → examine evidence, reframe)

**Evidence**: 60-70% of patients improve (gold standard for depression, anxiety)

---

### Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT)

**How It Works**:

- **Premise**: Accept what you can't control (having AATD, uncertainty), commit to values (what matters to you—family, career, hobbies)
- **Techniques**: Mindfulness (observe thoughts without judgment), defusion (distance from negative thoughts—"I'm having the thought that I'm dying" vs. "I'm dying"), values clarification (what do you want your life to be about?), committed action (take steps aligned with values)

**Applications in AATD**:

- **Grief**: Accept diagnosis (can't change it), focus on living according to values (be present parent, contribute to work, enjoy hobbies)
- **Uncertainty**: Accept unknown prognosis (can't predict future), reduce anxiety by focusing on present
- **Chronic pain/dyspnea**: Accept symptoms (can't eliminate shortness of breath), reduce suffering by not fighting it

**Evidence**: 30-40% improvement in quality of life (especially for chronic illness patients)

---

### Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing (EMDR)

**How It Works**:

- **Premise**: Trauma memories "stuck" in brain (not processed), cause flashbacks, nightmares, hypervigilance
- **Technique**: Patient recalls trauma (e.g., ICU intubation, diagnosis moment), while therapist guides eye movements (follow finger side-to-side) → brain reprocesses memory → memory becomes less distressing

**Applications in AATD**:

- **Medical trauma**: ICU stays, near-death experiences, painful procedures (bronchoscopy, liver biopsy)
- **PTSD**: Flashbacks, nightmares, avoidance (of medical settings, doctors)

**Evidence**: 70-80% reduction in PTSD symptoms (8-12 sessions)

---

### Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)

**How It Works**:

- **Premise**: Teach skills (distress tolerance, emotion regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, mindfulness)
- **Techniques**: Breathing exercises (calm anxiety), opposite action (if depressed, do activity even if don't feel like it), DEAR MAN (assertive communication with doctors, family)

**Applications in AATD**:

- **Emotion dysregulation**: Intense anger, sadness (roller coaster emotions)
- **Self-harm, suicidal ideation**: DBT originally for borderline personality disorder—effective for high-risk patients
- **Interpersonal conflict**: Strained relationships with caregivers, doctors (teach assertive communication)

**Evidence**: 50-60% reduction in self-harm, suicidal behavior (for high-risk patients)

---

### Grief Counseling

**How It Works**:

- **Premise**: Chronic illness = loss (loss of health, identity, future plans, independence)
- **Techniques**: Normalize grief (it's OK to mourn old life), process emotions (anger, sadness, guilt), find meaning (redefine identity, create new goals)

**Applications in AATD**:

- **Diagnosis grief**: Mourning pre-AATD life ("I used to run marathons, now I can't walk upstairs")
- **Anticipatory grief**: Fear of death, disability (especially advanced disease patients)
- **Caregiver grief**: Watching loved one suffer, decline

**Evidence**: Grief-specific therapy reduces complicated grief by 50% (vs. no treatment)

---

## Financial Assistance

### First Session Free (All Patients)

**Benefit**: Foundation covers initial consultation ($150 value)

**Eligibility**: Any AATD patient or family member (no income restrictions—universal benefit)

**Rationale**: Remove barrier to starting therapy (many patients hesitate due to cost—free first session = test without risk)

---

### Sliding Scale for Ongoing Therapy

**Who Qualifies**:

- Income < 200% FPL (~$60K for family of 4—working class, lower-middle class)
- Uninsured or underinsured (high deductible, therapy not covered)

**Benefit**:

- Foundation subsidizes therapy costs (covers portion of copay or full session fee)
- Patient pays reduced rate ($20-$50/session—vs. $150-$300 full price)

**Structure**:

| Income Level | Patient Pays    | Foundation Subsidizes |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------------- |
| < 100% FPL   | $0-$20/session  | $130-$150/session     |
| 100-150% FPL | $30-$40/session | $110-$120/session     |
| 150-200% FPL | $50/session     | $100/session          |

**Duration**: Up to 20 sessions per year (covers acute treatment—most depression/anxiety treatment is 12-16 sessions)

**Application**: Patient submits income verification (pay stubs, tax return) + insurance info (if any)

---

### Year 1 Budget: $100K

**Allocation**:

- First sessions free: 500 patients × $150 = $75K
- Sliding scale assistance: 100 patients × 10 sessions × $100 subsidy = $100K
- **Total**: $175K (Foundation fundraises to cover)

---

## Support Resources

### Peer Support Groups (Virtual)

**Topics** (Rotating Monthly):

- Coping with New Diagnosis
- Managing Anxiety & Depression
- Caregiver Support (separate group for family members)
- Lung Transplant Survivors (post-transplant mental health)
- Living with Advanced AATD
- Young Adults with AATD (ages 18-35—career, relationships, future planning)

**Benefits**:

- Skills (therapist teaches coping strategies—mindfulness, cognitive reframing)
- Free (no cost—Foundation covers therapist fee)

**Year 1 Goal**: 12 monthly groups × 25 participants = 300 total participants

---

### Self-Help Library (Online)

**Content**:

---

### Crisis Hotline

**Service**: 24/7 phone support (for suicidal ideation, panic attacks, severe distress)

**Staffing**:

- Partner with existing crisis line (988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline—national service)
- Foundation trains crisis counselors (on AATD—so they understand disease context)

**Protocol**:

- Caller reaches crisis counselor (trained in suicide prevention, de-escalation)
- Counselor assesses risk (imminent danger? plan? means?)
- Interventions: Safety planning (remove means, identify supports), referrals (ER, mobile crisis team, therapist), follow-up (call back next day)

---

## Success Metrics

### Track Quarterly

- # of patients in ongoing therapy (> 5 sessions)

**Outcomes**:

- Pre/post symptom scores (PHQ-9 for depression, GAD-7 for anxiety—measure improvement)
- Treatment adherence (do patients on therapy adhere better to augmentation therapy?)
- Quality of life (SF-36, EQ-5D—does therapy improve QOL?)

**Patient Satisfaction**:

- Cost per patient served (program efficiency)

---

### Year 1 Targets

**Network**:

- 100 therapists recruited (50 states)

**Reach**:

- 500 patients referred
- 300 patients start therapy (first session)
- 150 patients complete course of therapy (10+ sessions)

**Outcomes**:

- 50% reduction in depression symptoms (PHQ-9 score drops by 50% on average)
- 50% reduction in anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 score drops by 50%)
- 20% improvement in treatment adherence (patients on therapy → more adherent to augmentation)

**Satisfaction**:

- 4.5+ average therapist rating (5-star scale)
- 90% would recommend to other AATD patients

---
