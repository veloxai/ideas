## Programs Overview

### Why Specialized Programs Matter

**AATD Affects Diverse Populations**:

- **Children** (5-10% of AATD patients diagnosed in childhood—mostly liver disease, some lung symptoms)
- **Liver Disease Patients** (10-15% of ZZ patients develop severe liver disease—cirrhosis, transplant)
- **Veterans** (15-20% of AATD patients are military veterans—unique exposures, VA benefits)

**These Groups Have Unique Needs** (not addressed by standard AATD programs):

- ❌ **Pediatric patients**: Need school accommodations, pediatric specialists, family support, transition to adult care
- ❌ **Liver patients**: No augmentation therapy for liver (only transplant), different monitoring, hepatologists (not pulmonologists)
- ❌ **Veterans**: Eligible for VA benefits (but complex to navigate), military exposures (burn pits, toxic chemicals—worsen AATD), unique culture

**Mark Egly Foundation Specialized Programs Fill These Gaps**

---

### Three Programs Launched

**1. Pediatric AATD Program**:

- Support families of children with AATD (birth to age 21)
- Services: Pediatric specialist referrals, school advocacy, family counseling, teen support groups, transition planning (to adult care)

**2. Liver Disease Program**:

- Support AATD patients with liver involvement (any age—pediatric or adult)
- Services: Hepatologist network, liver screening protocols, transplant navigation, clinical trial matching (liver-specific trials)

**3. Veterans AATD Program**:

- Support military veterans with AATD (any branch—Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard)
- Services: VA benefits navigation, service-connected disability claims, military exposure screening, veteran peer support

---

### Goals (Year 1—All Three Programs)

**Reach**:

- 200 pediatric families supported
- 300 liver disease patients supported
- 500 veterans supported

**Outcomes**:

- 90% of pediatric patients have IEP/504 plan (school accommodations)
- 100% of liver disease patients connected to hepatologist
- 80% of veterans enrolled in VA healthcare (or applied for benefits)

---

## Pediatric AATD Program

### Target Population

**Who We Serve**:

- Children ages 0-21 with AATD (any genotype—ZZ, SZ, MZ, rare variants)
- Parents, siblings, caregivers

**Presentations in Children**:

- **Neonatal liver disease** (10% of ZZ infants—cholestasis, jaundice, elevated liver enzymes)
- **Chronic liver disease** (5% of ZZ children—progress to cirrhosis by age 10-20)
- **Lung symptoms** (rare in childhood—but some children have asthma, recurrent infections)
- **Asymptomatic** (most ZZ children are symptom-free—identified through family testing, newborn screening)

---

### Services Offered

#### 1. Pediatric Specialist Network

**Challenge**: Most AATD specialists treat adults (pediatric expertise rare)

**Solution**: Foundation recruits pediatric subspecialists:

- **Pediatric Hepatologists** (liver disease—manage cholestasis, monitor for cirrhosis)
- **Pediatric Pulmonologists** (lung symptoms—asthma, recurrent infections)
- **Pediatric Genetic Counselors** (family planning, genetic testing)

**Network** (Year 1—Target 20 Specialists):

- Children's hospitals (Boston Children's, Cincinnati Children's, CHOP, Lucile Packard Stanford, Texas Children's)
- Referrals: Foundation provides warm referrals (Navigator connects families to specialists)

---

#### 2. School Advocacy Program

**504 Plans & IEPs** (Individualized Education Program):

- Children with AATD may need accommodations (missed school for doctor visits, fatigue from liver disease, exercise limitations if lung symptoms)
- Foundation provides:
  - **Template 504 Plan** (pre-written accommodations—download, customize, submit to school)
  - **Advocacy Guide** (how to request 504/IEP, what to ask for, how to appeal denials)
  - **Consultation** (Foundation staff reviews draft, suggests edits, role-plays meeting with parents)

**Accommodations Examples**:

- Excused absences (for medical appointments—no penalty)
- Modified PE (if lung symptoms—lighter exercise, rest breaks)
- Medication administration (school nurse gives meds if needed—e.g., inhalers)
- Extra time (for assignments, tests—if fatigue from liver disease)
- Home-bound instruction (if hospitalized for transplant, extended illness)

---

#### 3. Family Support Services

**Parent Counseling**:

- Individual therapy (cope with guilt—"I passed AATD to my child", fear—"Will my child need transplant?")
- Couples counseling (AATD diagnosis strains marriages—40% report marital conflict)

**Sibling Support**:

- Sibling support groups (for healthy siblings—feel neglected, scared, confused)
- Education (help siblings understand AATD, why brother/sister is sick)

**Financial Assistance**:

- Emergency grants ($500-$2,500—help families cover medical bills, travel to specialists, lost wages during hospitalizations)

---

#### 4. Teen Support Program

**Challenge**: Teens with AATD face unique issues (identity, independence, dating, college planning)

**Services**:

- **Teen Support Groups** (ages 13-21—video calls, monthly, peer-led with therapist facilitator)
- **Topics**: Managing AATD in high school, dating ("Should I tell my girlfriend I have AATD?"), college planning (dorm accommodations, health insurance), career planning (AATD-friendly jobs)
- **Mentorship**: Match teens with young adults with AATD (ages 22-30—role models, "You can thrive with AATD")

---

#### 5. Transition to Adult Care

**Problem**: At age 18-21, patients "age out" of pediatric care (switch to adult doctors—often chaotic, patients get lost)

**Foundation Transition Program**:

- **Transition Checklist** (at age 16, start planning—find adult pulmonologist, transfer records, learn self-management skills)
- **Navigator Support** (help find adult AATD specialist, schedule first appointment, ensure continuity)
- **Self-Management Training** (teach teen to manage own care—schedule appointments, refill prescriptions, advocate with doctors)

---

### Pediatric Resources

**Educational Materials** (For Parents & Kids):

- "Explaining AATD to Your Child" (age-appropriate language—toddler, elementary, teen)
- "AATD for Teens" (booklet—what is AATD, how to manage, living fully)
- Coloring book ("Alpha the Friendly Protein"—teach kids about AATD in fun way)

**Summer Camp**:

- Weekend camp for kids with AATD (ages 8-17—meet other AATD kids, outdoor activities, medical education sessions)
- **Model**: Paul Newman's Hole in the Wall Gang Camp (for kids with serious illnesses)
- Year 3 goal (once program matures)

---

### Success Metrics (Pediatric Program—Year 1)

**Reach**:

- 200 pediatric families enrolled
- 50 families connected to pediatric specialists

**School Advocacy**:

- 90% of school-age children have 504 plan or IEP (accommodations in place)

**Family Support**:

- 100 parents receive counseling (individual or couples)
- 50 siblings participate in sibling support groups

**Transition**:

- 25 teens transition to adult care (with Navigator support—100% continuity, no lost follow-up)

---

## Liver Disease Program

### Target Population

**Who We Serve**:

- AATD patients with liver involvement (any age—pediatric or adult)
- **Neonatal cholestasis** (ZZ infants—10% have liver disease at birth)
- **Chronic liver disease** (5-10% of ZZ adults—cirrhosis, portal hypertension)
- **Liver transplant candidates** (end-stage liver disease—waiting for transplant)

**Liver Disease in AATD**:

- **Cause**: Z protein accumulates in liver (toxic—causes inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis)
- **No medical treatment**: Augmentation therapy doesn't help liver (only replaces protein in blood—doesn't remove protein from liver)
- **Only cure**: Liver transplant (for cirrhosis, liver failure)

---

### Services Offered

#### 1. Hepatologist Network

**Problem**: Many AATD patients see pulmonologists only (liver disease missed, not monitored)

**Solution**: Foundation recruits hepatologists (liver specialists) with AATD expertise

**Network** (Year 1—Target 30 Hepatologists):

- Transplant centers (UCSF, Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, UPMC, Baylor)
- Community hepatologists (some GI doctors have AATD experience)

**Referral Service**:

- Patient calls Foundation → Navigator assesses liver risk (AAT level, genotype, liver enzymes)
- If elevated liver enzymes or high-risk genotype (ZZ, SZ) → refer to hepatologist
- Navigator provides warm referral (calls hepatologist, explains case, schedules appointment)

---

#### 2. Liver Screening Protocols

**Guidelines**: All AATD patients should have liver screening (many don't—doctors focus on lungs, forget liver)

**Foundation Screening Recommendations**:

- **For ZZ, SZ patients** (all ages):
  - Annual liver enzyme panel (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, albumin, INR)
  - Ultrasound every 3-5 years (screen for cirrhosis, liver cancer)
  - FibroScan every 2-3 years (non-invasive—measures liver stiffness, detects fibrosis/cirrhosis)
- **For MZ, MS patients** (lower risk, but still monitor):
  - Liver enzymes every 2-3 years (if abnormal, escalate to annual)

**Foundation Provides**:

- **Screening Tracker** (in Medical Records Portal—reminders when tests due)
- **Doctor Letter** (patient brings to PCP—"Please order liver screening per Foundation guidelines")

---

#### 3. Liver Transplant Navigation

**Transplant Indications**:

- Cirrhosis with complications (ascites, variceal bleeding, encephalopathy)
- Liver failure (MELD score > 15)
- Hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer—5-10% of AATD cirrhosis patients)

**Foundation Transplant Support**:

- **Transplant Center Referrals**: Navigate to top centers (UCSF, Cleveland Clinic, Mayo—best outcomes for AATD liver transplants)
- **Evaluation Assistance**: Help complete workup (cardiology, nephrology, psych, dental clearance—complex process)
- **Waitlist Support**: Patient Navigator checks in monthly (emotional support, answer questions, coordinate care)
- **Travel Assistance**: Foundation travel grants (cover flights, lodging for evaluation, surgery, follow-up—see Medical Travel Assistance Program)
- **Post-Transplant**: Peer support groups (liver transplant survivors—share experiences, recovery tips)

---

#### 4. Clinical Trial Matching (Liver-Specific)

**Trials for AATD Liver Disease**:

- **Fazirsiran** (RNAi therapy—reduces Z protein production in liver—Phase 3 trial ongoing)
- **Gene therapy** (AAV vectors—correct Z mutation in liver cells)
- **Anti-fibrotic drugs** (slow progression to cirrhosis)

**Foundation Service**:

- Maintain trial database (liver-specific trials—ClinicalTrials.gov, pharma pipelines)
- Match patients to trials (based on eligibility—genotype, liver enzymes, fibrosis stage)
- Facilitate enrollment (connect patient to trial site, coordinate screening)

---

#### 5. Pediatric Liver Disease Support

**Special Focus on Kids**:

- **Neonatal cholestasis**: Support parents (infant has jaundice, elevated liver enzymes—scary, uncertain prognosis)
- **Dietary management**: Nutritionist consultation (high-calorie diet for growth, fat-soluble vitamin supplements—ADEK)
- **Growth monitoring**: Track growth charts (liver disease can cause failure to thrive)
- **Liver transplant in children**: Unique challenges (pediatric donors rare, lifelong immunosuppression, psychosocial impact)

---

### Liver Disease Resources

**Educational Materials**:

- "AATD & Your Liver" (booklet—how AATD affects liver, symptoms, screening, treatment)
- "Understanding Cirrhosis" (guide—what is cirrhosis, complications, management, transplant)
- "Liver Transplant: What to Expect" (timeline, process, recovery, life after transplant)

**Webinars** (Quarterly):

- "Liver Screening for AATD Patients" (when to screen, interpreting results)
- "Living with AATD Cirrhosis" (managing complications, quality of life)
- "Preparing for Liver Transplant" (evaluation, waitlist, surgery, recovery)

---

### Success Metrics (Liver Program—Year 1)

**Reach**:

- 300 liver disease patients enrolled

**Screening**:

- 90% of ZZ patients receive annual liver enzyme panel
- 50% of ZZ patients have FibroScan or ultrasound (within 3 years)

**Specialist Access**:

- 100% of patients with elevated liver enzymes connected to hepatologist (within 30 days of referral)

**Transplant**:

- 20 patients supported through liver transplant evaluation/surgery
- 100% of transplant patients receive travel assistance

**Trials**:

- 50 liver disease patients matched to clinical trials
- 10 patients enrolled in liver-specific trials

---

## Veterans AATD Program

### Target Population

**Who We Serve**:

- Military veterans with AATD (any branch, any era—WWII to present)
- Estimated 3,000-4,000 US veterans have AATD (15-20% of AATD population are veterans)

**Why Veterans Are Vulnerable**:

- **Military exposures** worsen AATD:
  - **Burn pits** (Iraq, Afghanistan—toxic smoke from burning trash, oil—lung damage)
  - **Depleted uranium** (Gulf War—inhaled dust—lung, liver toxicity)
  - **Agent Orange** (Vietnam—herbicide exposure—liver disease, cancer)
  - **Industrial toxins** (shipyards, mechanics, fuel handlers—volatile organic compounds, solvents)
- **Delayed diagnosis**: VA doctors may not be familiar with AATD (rare disease—not in routine differential)
- **Complex benefits**: VA healthcare, disability compensation, service-connected claims (confusing to navigate)

---

### Services Offered

#### 1. VA Benefits Navigation

**Foundation Navigator** (Veteran Services Specialist):

- Help veterans enroll in VA healthcare (eligibility, application, enrollment priority groups)
- Assist with disability claims (service-connected disability for AATD—if worsened by military exposures)
- Connect to VA benefits (vocational rehab, adaptive equipment, caregiver support)

**VA Healthcare Enrollment**:

- **Eligibility**: All veterans with AATD qualify (chronic illness = priority group)
- **Application**: Navigator helps complete forms (VA Form 10-10EZ—complex, Navigator guides through)
- **Benefits**: VA covers AATD care (augmentation therapy, oxygen, transplant—no copays for low-income veterans)

---

#### 2. Service-Connected Disability Claims

**What is Service-Connected Disability**?

- If AATD was caused or worsened by military service → veteran eligible for disability compensation (monthly payments + healthcare priority)

**How to Prove Service Connection** (Complex):

- **Direct service connection**: Exposure in military (e.g., burn pit smoke worsened AATD lung disease—need medical nexus letter)
- **Aggravation**: AATD pre-existed military service, but military worsened it (e.g., ZZ patient, FEV1 70% at enlistment, FEV1 40% at discharge—decline beyond natural progression)

**Foundation Support**:

- **Claims Assistance**: Navigator helps file VA claim (VA Form 21-526EZ—disability compensation claim)
- **Medical Nexus Letters**: Connect veteran to doctors (who write nexus letters—"It is at least as likely as not that veteran's AATD was aggravated by burn pit exposure")
- **Appeals**: If claim denied (common—60% of AATD claims initially denied), Navigator helps appeal (Board of Veterans Appeals, Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims)

---

#### 3. Military Exposure Screening

**Exposure Assessment** (For All Veterans):

- Navigator conducts interview (deployment history, job specialty, known exposures)
- Identify high-risk exposures:
  - **Burn pits** (Iraq, Afghanistan—2003-2021—all service members near burn pits exposed)
  - **Agent Orange** (Vietnam, Thailand, Korean DMZ—herbicide exposure)
  - **Gulf War exposures** (depleted uranium, oil well fires, pesticides)
  - **Shipboard exposures** (asbestos, fuel vapors, engine exhaust)

**Screening Protocols**:

- If high-risk exposure → recommend enhanced monitoring (annual CT scans, liver screening, lung function tests every 6 months)
- Document exposures (for VA claims—exposure history critical to proving service connection)

---

#### 4. VA-Specific AATD Centers

**Partnership with VA Medical Centers**:

- Foundation partners with VA hospitals (recruit AATD specialists within VA system)
- **Year 1 Target**: 5 VA AATD Centers (West LA VA, Miami VA, Boston VA, Minneapolis VA, Denver VA)
- Veterans can receive care at these centers (AATD expertise + VA benefits)

---

#### 5. Veteran Peer Support

**Veteran AATD Support Groups**:

- Monthly video calls (veterans only—share military experiences, VA benefits tips, AATD management)
- Led by veteran with AATD (peer leader—understands military culture and AATD)

**Buddy Program**:

- Newly diagnosed veteran matched with veteran AATD "buddy" (navigate VA system together, emotional support)

---
