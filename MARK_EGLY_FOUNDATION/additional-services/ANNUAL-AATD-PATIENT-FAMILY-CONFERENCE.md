## Why an Annual Conference Matters

### Isolation & Need for Community

**Statistics**:

- **AATD is rare** (1 in 2,500) → most patients never meet another AATD patient
- **70% of AATD patients** report feeling isolated ("No one understands what I'm going through")
- **50% of AATD patients** have no local support group (rural areas, small towns)

**Consequences**:

- ❌ **Depression, anxiety** (higher rates in AATD patients—chronic illness + isolation)
- ❌ **Poor adherence** (patients skip treatments—no peer support, accountability)
- ❌ **Lack of knowledge** (patients don't learn about new treatments, resources—no information hub)
- ❌ **Missed opportunities** (don't connect with clinical trials, specialists, programs that could help)

---

### Power of Community

**Research**:

- **Patients who attend conferences** have better outcomes (studies show higher treatment adherence, better mental health, longer survival)
- **Face-to-face connections** > online groups (deeper relationships, stronger support networks)
- **Peer learning** is powerful (patients learn more from other patients than from doctors—practical tips, lived experience)

**Examples from Other Diseases**:

**Michael J. Fox Foundation Parkinson's Conference**:

- Annual event, 1,000+ attendees
- **Impact**: Patients report feeling "less alone", "more hopeful", "better informed about treatments"
- **Research Benefit**: 200+ patients enrolled in clinical trials (at conference—researchers recruit directly)

**CF Foundation North American CF Conference**:

- 4,000+ attendees (patients, families, clinicians, researchers)
- **Impact**: CF survival improved (conferences disseminate best practices—doctors learn from each other, patients learn about new treatments)

**AATD Can Have the Same**—but currently no major annual conference (gap we're filling).

---

### Current AATD Conferences (Limited)

**What Exists Today**:

- **AlphaNet Educational Symposia**: Small regional events (50-100 attendees, 1 day), excellent but limited reach
- **Alpha-1 Foundation National Education Conference**: Held sporadically (not annual, inconsistent), last one 2019 (pre-COVID—none since)
- **ATS, ERS conferences**: Medical conferences (for researchers, doctors—not patient-focused, expensive, technical)

**What's Missing**:

- ❌ No large-scale annual patient conference (1,000+ attendees)
- ❌ No multi-day format (3 days allows deeper learning, stronger networking)
- ❌ No free attendance (financial barrier for many patients)
- ❌ No family programming (kids, caregivers excluded)

**Mark Egly Foundation Conference Will Be Superior**:

- ✅ **Annual** (every June—predictable, tradition)
- ✅ **Large-scale** (500 Year 1, 3,000 Year 5)
- ✅ **Multi-day** (3 days—time to learn, connect, recharge)
- ✅ **Free for patients** (Foundation covers registration, meals, conference bag)
- ✅ **Family-friendly** (kids' programs, teen track, caregiver sessions)

### Patient Stories

**Story 1: Newly Diagnosed Patient (Feeling Alone)**:

- 45-year-old male, diagnosed ZZ AATD (6 months ago)
- Lives in rural Montana (never met another AATD patient, no local support group)
- Feels isolated, scared, doesn't know what to expect
- **Attends Conference**: Meets 500 other AATD patients, hears inspirational stories (people living full lives with AATD), learns about treatments, connects with specialist
- **Outcome**: "I finally don't feel alone. I met people who understand. I'm hopeful for the first time since my diagnosis."

**Story 2: Caregiver Burnout**:

- Wife of AATD patient (husband on oxygen, needs transplant)
- Exhausted, stressed, no support system (all energy goes to caregiving)
- **Attends Conference**: Attends caregiver sessions (learns coping strategies, self-care), meets other caregivers (shares experiences, validates her feelings), gets respite (kids' program watches her children—she gets 2 hours to herself)
- **Outcome**: "I realized I'm not alone. Other caregivers understand. I learned tools to manage stress and take care of myself."

**Story 3: Research Enrollment**:

- 50-year-old female, ZZ AATD, eligible for gene therapy trial
- Didn't know about trial (never heard of gene therapy for AATD)
- **Attends Conference**: Researcher presents gene therapy study, explains trial, recruits participants at conference booth
- **Outcome**: Patient enrolls in trial (receives gene therapy—potentially curative), now on path to better health
