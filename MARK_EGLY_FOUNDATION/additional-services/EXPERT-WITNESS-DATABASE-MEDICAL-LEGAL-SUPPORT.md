## Why Expert Witnesses Matter

### Medical Complexity Requires Expert Testimony

**AATD is Rare & Misunderstood**:

- Judges, juries, opposing attorneys, insurance adjusters **don't understand AATD** (never heard of it, don't know genetics, prognosis, treatment)
- **Without expert testimony**, patient's case fails (e.g., disability judge doesn't believe AATD is disabling—denies claim)
- **With expert testimony**, judge/jury understands (expert explains disease, limitations, why patient can't work—case succeeds)

**Experts Establish**:

- **Standard of care** (what reasonable doctor should do—did defendant doctor meet standard? if not, malpractice)
- **Causation** (did doctor's negligence cause harm? or was outcome inevitable given AATD progression?)
- **Disability** (can patient work? what limitations? what accommodations needed?)
- **Prognosis** (life expectancy, future medical needs—for damages calculation)
- **Genetic implications** (inheritance, family testing, prenatal diagnosis—for custody, family law cases)

---

### Common Legal Scenarios for AATD Patients

**1. Delayed Diagnosis / Missed Diagnosis (Medical Malpractice)**:

- Doctor fails to test for AATD (patient has young-onset COPD, non-smoker—red flags ignored)
- Diagnosis delayed 5-10 years (patient suffers irreversible lung damage—could have been prevented with early augmentation therapy)
- **Expert witness role**: Establish standard of care (doctor should have tested for AATD), causation (delay caused additional lung damage), damages (quantify harm)

**2. Social Security Disability (SSDI, SSI)**:

- AATD patient can't work (severe lung disease, on oxygen, frequent exacerbations)
- Social Security denies claim ("Not disabled—can do sedentary work")
- **Expert witness role**: Testify patient cannot work (even sedentary jobs require 8-hour days, patient fatigues after 2 hours; exacerbations cause frequent absences; oxygen use limits employability)

**3. Long-Term Disability (LTD) Insurance**:

- Patient has private disability insurance (through employer)
- Insurance denies claim ("Not totally disabled—can do modified duties")
- **Expert witness role**: Explain AATD limitations (shortness of breath, fatigue, oxygen dependence), establish patient cannot perform job duties (even with accommodations)

**4. Veterans Disability Claims (VA)**:

- Veteran claims AATD worsened by military service (burn pits, toxic exposures)
- VA denies ("Not service-connected—AATD is genetic")
- **Expert witness role**: Establish nexus (military exposures aggravated AATD—accelerated lung function decline beyond natural progression)

**5. Employment Discrimination (ADA)**:

- Employer fires patient (after AATD diagnosis)
- Patient sues (disability discrimination—ADA violation)
- **Expert witness role**: Establish patient is "disabled" under ADA (AATD substantially limits major life activities), explain reasonable accommodations (modified schedule, work-from-home, oxygen use)

**6. Custody Disputes (Family Law)**:

- Parent with AATD (fights for custody, ex-spouse argues "You're too sick to care for kids")
- **Expert witness role**: Explain AATD doesn't prevent parenting (with proper treatment, many patients live normal lives), address specific limitations (if any), recommend accommodations (e.g., backup caregiver during exacerbations)

**7. Life Insurance / Health Insurance Denial**:

- Insurance denies coverage (or charges exorbitant premiums—based on AATD diagnosis)
- Patient appeals (genetic discrimination—GINA, ACA protections)
- **Expert witness role**: Explain AATD prognosis (many patients live normal lifespan—not all develop severe disease), challenge insurer's risk assessment

---

### Patient Stories

**Story 1: Delayed Diagnosis Malpractice Case**:

- 40-year-old female, diagnosed ZZ AATD at age 40 (FEV1 45%—already severe lung disease)
- Had symptoms since age 30 (shortness of breath, wheezing, recurrent "bronchitis")
- Saw PCP multiple times (age 30-40), doctor diagnosed "asthma" (prescribed inhalers, never tested for AATD)
- At age 40, sees pulmonologist (immediately orders AAT test—ZZ diagnosis)
- Patient sues PCP (malpractice—should have tested for AATD years earlier, delay caused irreversible lung damage)
- **Expert Witness** (Foundation-referred pulmonologist): Reviews records, writes report ("Standard of care: Test for AATD in young patient with COPD symptoms, non-smoker. Doctor breached standard. Delay from age 30-40 caused FEV1 decline from ~70% to 45%—significant harm. With early diagnosis + augmentation therapy, patient would likely have FEV1 ~60% today—10-15 year life expectancy difference.")
- **Outcome**: Case settles ($750K—malpractice insurer agrees doctor negligent, expert testimony made case strong)

**Story 2: Social Security Disability**:

- 55-year-old male, ZZ AATD, FEV1 30%, on continuous oxygen (4L/min), frequent exacerbations (3-4/year, hospitalized 1-2x/year)
- Applies for SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance—can't work, needs income)
- Social Security denies ("You can do sedentary work—sit at desk, answer phones")
- Patient appeals (with attorney—Foundation-referred disability lawyer)
- Hearing before ALJ (administrative law judge)
- **Expert Witness** (Foundation-referred pulmonologist): Testifies at hearing ("Patient's FEV1 30% = severe COPD. Oxygen-dependent = can't work outside home (oxygen tanks, portability). Frequent exacerbations = unpredictable absences (employer won't tolerate 30+ sick days/year). Even sedentary work requires 8-hour days, full attention—patient fatigues after 2-3 hours. Cannot sustain full-time employment.")
- **Outcome**: ALJ approves disability (expert testimony persuasive—judge understands AATD limitations, grants benefits)

**Story 3: Veterans Disability Claim**:

- 50-year-old male, Army veteran (Iraq War, 2005-2008, exposed to burn pits daily)
- Diagnosed ZZ AATD (after discharge), FEV1 50% at age 45 (rapid decline)
- Files VA claim (service-connected disability—burn pits worsened AATD)
- VA denies ("AATD is genetic—not caused by military service")
- Veteran appeals (with attorney—Foundation-referred VA disability lawyer)
- **Expert Witness** (Foundation-referred pulmonologist): Writes nexus letter ("Veteran has genetic predisposition (ZZ AATD), but burn pit exposure accelerated lung disease. Expected FEV1 decline for ZZ patient = 50-80 mL/year. Veteran's decline = 150 mL/year (double normal rate)—consistent with toxic inhalational injury. It is at least as likely as not that burn pit exposure aggravated veteran's AATD.")
- **Outcome**: VA approves claim (80% service-connected disability rating—$1,600/month compensation, free VA healthcare for life)

## Legal Scenarios Requiring Experts

### 1. Medical Malpractice

**Common Claims**:

- **Delayed diagnosis** (doctor didn't test for AATD despite red flags—young-onset COPD, family history, non-smoker)
- **Misdiagnosis** (doctor said "asthma" or "chronic bronchitis"—patient actually has AATD, treatment delayed)
- **Treatment errors** (doctor prescribed wrong medication, didn't refer to specialist, failed to monitor)
- **Surgical complications** (lung biopsy, liver biopsy, transplant—complications due to surgeon negligence)

**Expert Witness Role**:

- Establish **standard of care** (what reasonable doctor should do in this situation)
- Opine on **breach** (did defendant doctor deviate from standard? if so, how?)
- Establish **causation** (did breach cause harm? or was outcome inevitable?)
- Quantify **damages** (how much harm? life expectancy reduction, additional medical costs, pain & suffering)

**Expert Fees**: $400-$800/hour (record review, report writing, deposition, trial testimony)

---

### 2. Disability Claims

**Types**:

- **Social Security Disability** (SSDI, SSI—federal disability benefits)
- **Long-Term Disability Insurance** (LTD—private insurance through employer)
- **State Disability** (SDI—short-term disability, e.g., California State Disability Insurance)
- **Veterans Disability** (VA disability compensation—service-connected)

**Expert Witness Role**:

- Establish **disability** (patient cannot work—explain AATD limitations, functional capacity)
- Address **vocational capacity** (what jobs, if any, can patient do? sedentary work? part-time?)
- Establish **duration** (is disability permanent? or temporary?)
- For VA claims: Establish **service connection** (did military service cause/aggravate AATD?)

**Expert Fees**: $300-$600/hour (record review, report, hearing testimony)

---

### 3. Employment Discrimination

**Claims**:

- **ADA discrimination** (fired, not hired, denied promotion—because of AATD)
- **FMLA violations** (employer denied medical leave for augmentation therapy, exacerbations)
- **Failure to accommodate** (employer refused reasonable accommodations—work-from-home, modified schedule, oxygen use)
- **Hostile work environment** (coworkers harass patient—"You're always sick," "You're faking it")

**Expert Witness Role**:

- Establish **disability** (AATD substantially limits major life activities—breathing, working, exertion)
- Identify **reasonable accommodations** (what accommodations would enable patient to work? are they feasible?)
- Rebut employer's defense ("Patient can't do essential job functions" → expert: "With accommodations, patient can perform job")

**Expert Fees**: $300-$600/hour

---

### 4. Insurance Litigation

**Claims**:

- **Health insurance denial** (insurer denies augmentation therapy, lung transplant, genetic testing)
- **Life insurance denial** (denied coverage or exorbitant premiums—based on AATD diagnosis)
- **Disability insurance bad faith** (LTD insurer denies valid claim—patient sues for bad faith)

**Expert Witness Role**:

- Establish **medical necessity** (augmentation therapy is standard of care for ZZ patients with lung disease—not experimental)
- Challenge **insurer's medical review** (insurer's doctor says "not medically necessary"—expert rebuts, cites guidelines)
- Establish **prognosis** (for life insurance cases—many AATD patients live normal lifespan, insurer's risk assessment flawed)

**Expert Fees**: $400-$800/hour

---

### 5. Family Law (Custody, Divorce)

**Scenarios**:

- **Custody disputes** (ex-spouse argues parent with AATD too sick to care for children)
- **Child support** (parent claims AATD disability reduces income—affects child support calculation)
- **Parenting plans** (court needs expert to assess parenting capacity—with AATD limitations)

**Expert Witness Role**:

- Assess **parenting capacity** (can parent safely care for children? what limitations, if any?)
- Recommend **accommodations** (backup caregiver during exacerbations, co-parenting adjustments)
- Address **genetic risk** (if children have AATD—explain prognosis, treatment, impact on custody decisions)

**Expert Fees**: $300-$600/hour

---

### 6. Estate Planning / Probate

**Scenarios**:

- **Testamentary capacity** (did AATD patient have mental capacity to sign will? challenges if advanced liver disease caused hepatic encephalopathy)
- **Life expectancy** (for estate tax purposes, trust distributions—need medical expert to estimate life expectancy)

**Expert Witness Role**:

- Assess **mental capacity** (review medical records—was patient competent when signed will?)
- Estimate **life expectancy** (based on FEV1, liver disease, comorbidities—actuarial calculation)

**Expert Fees**: $300-$500/hour

---

### 7. Criminal Cases (Rare)

**Scenarios**:

- **DUI defense** (AATD patient arrested for DUI—expert testifies oxygen use, medications affected breathalyzer, field sobriety tests)
- **Mitigation in sentencing** (defendant has AATD—expert testifies prison would be death sentence due to inadequate medical care—ask for home confinement, probation)

**Expert Witness Role**:

- Explain **medical limitations** (AATD affects breathalyzer results, gait—not intoxication)
- Establish **need for medical care** (prison cannot provide augmentation therapy, specialized AATD care—defendant would deteriorate rapidly)

**Expert Fees**: $400-$800/hour

---

## Matching & Referral Process

### Step 1: Patient Contacts Foundation

**How to Request**:

- **Phone**: 1-800-AATD-LAW (Navigator answers)
- **Online**: Submit form (MarkEglyFoundation.org/ExpertWitness—10-15 min questionnaire)
- **Attorney Referral**: Attorney contacts Foundation (on behalf of client—"I represent AATD patient in disability case, need expert witness")

**Initial Screening** (Navigator Assesses):

- Case type (malpractice, disability, employment, insurance, family law, etc.)
- Legal question (what does expert need to opine on? diagnosis? causation? disability? accommodation?)
- Jurisdiction (what state? some experts only licensed in certain states)
- Timeline (when is trial? deposition? report deadline?)
- Budget (can patient/attorney afford expert fees? qualify for financial assistance?)

---

### Step 2: Case Review (Foundation + Attorney)

**Preliminary Assessment**:

- Navigator consults with Foundation's legal counsel (is case viable? what expert needed?)
- If patient doesn't have attorney: Foundation refers to attorney (from Attorney Referral Network—see Support Services)

**Medical Record Review**:

- Navigator obtains records (with patient authorization)
- Summarizes key facts (for expert—so expert can assess if they're appropriate for case)

---

### Step 3: Expert Matching

**Navigator Searches Database**:

- Filter by: Specialty (pulmonology, hepatology, etc.), case type (malpractice, disability, etc.), jurisdiction (state where expert licensed), availability (timeline fits expert's schedule)
- Identify 2-3 potential experts (provide options to patient/attorney)

**Expert Profiles Sent**:

- Navigator emails patient/attorney (expert profiles—credentials, experience, fees, contact info)
- Patient/attorney reviews (choose expert based on fit, cost, credibility)

---

### Step 4: Expert Engagement

**Patient/Attorney Contacts Expert Directly**:

- Call or email (using contact info provided by Foundation)
- Discuss case (expert assesses—am I qualified? do I have time? do I agree with patient's position?)
- **Expert decides**: Accept or decline (experts not obligated—screen cases for merit, conflicts, interest)

**If Expert Accepts**:

- Attorney sends retainer agreement (standard expert witness contract—scope, fees, timeline)
- Expert reviews records (preliminary—assess if case has merit)
- Expert provides opinion (written report, deposition, trial testimony—as needed)

**If Expert Declines**:

- Navigator provides next expert option (from original 2-3 matched experts)

---

### Step 5: Foundation Follow-Up

**Navigator Checks In**:

- After expert engaged (ensure process went smoothly)
- After case conclusion (outcome? was expert helpful? feedback for database)

**Database Updated**:

- Expert's profile updated (# of cases completed, testimonials from attorneys, availability)

---
