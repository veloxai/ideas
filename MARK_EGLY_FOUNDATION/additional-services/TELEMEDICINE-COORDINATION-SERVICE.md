## The Access Problem

### Shortage of AATD Specialists

**Statistics**:

- **100,000-200,000** Americans have AATD (estimated)
- **~50** pulmonologists with deep AATD expertise (0.0005 specialists per patient)
- **AATD Centers of Excellence**: ~15 nationally (National Jewish Health, Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, etc.)
- **Average distance to AATD expert**: 200+ miles (for rural patients)

**Consequences**:

- **Delayed Diagnosis**: Local doctors miss AATD (not familiar with disease)
- **Suboptimal Treatment**: Patients not started on augmentation therapy (local doctor unaware of guidelines)
- **Poor Outcomes**: Preventable disease progression, hospitalizations, death

---

### Geographic Disparities

**AATD Specialists Concentrated in Urban Areas**:

- **Northeast**: Boston, NYC, Philadelphia
- **Midwest**: Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis
- **West**: Denver, San Francisco, Los Angeles
- **South**: Limited (Atlanta, Houston, few others)

**Rural Patients Underserved**:

- **50+ million** Americans live in rural areas
- **~20%** of AATD patients are rural
- **Barriers**:
  - No local pulmonologist (or general pulmonologist with no AATD experience)
  - Long travel distances (4-6 hours one-way to specialist)
  - Travel costs (gas, hotel, time off work)
  - Physical limitations (severe lung disease—can't travel)

---

### Patient Stories (Why Telemedicine Matters)

**Story 1: Rural Wyoming Patient**:

- 52-year-old male, ZZ genotype, FEV1 45%
- Nearest AATD specialist: Denver (400 miles, 6-hour drive)
- On oxygen (can't travel long distances)
- **Solution**: Telemedicine visit with Denver specialist → prescribed augmentation therapy, coordinated with local infusion center
- **Outcome**: Patient started treatment without traveling, lung function stabilized

**Story 2: Single Mother, Florida**:

- 38-year-old female, ZZ genotype, FEV1 60%, two young children
- Can't take 2 days off work to travel to Miami specialist
- **Solution**: Telemedicine visit during lunch break (from home)
- **Outcome**: Received expert care without disrupting work/family

**Story 3: Newly Diagnosed, Need Second Opinion**:

- 45-year-old male, just diagnosed, local doctor recommends "wait and watch"
- Patient wants second opinion from AATD expert
- **Solution**: Telemedicine consult with National Jewish Health specialist → confirmed augmentation therapy indicated
- **Outcome**: Started treatment 6 months earlier (prevented lung damage)

## Telemedicine Solution

### How Telemedicine Coordination Works

**Step 1: Patient Enrolls** (Phone, Web, or Referral):

- Fills out intake form (demographics, diagnosis, insurance, chief concern)
- Consent forms (HIPAA, telemedicine consent, records release)

**Step 2: Specialist Matching** (2-3 Days):

- Foundation matches patient with appropriate specialist:
  - **Pulmonologist** (for lung disease—most common)
  - **Hepatologist** (for liver disease)
  - **Geneticist** (for family planning, genetic counseling)
  - **Transplant Specialist** (for lung/liver transplant evaluation)
- Verify specialist offers telemedicine + accepts patient's insurance (or willing to see uninsured patients pro bono)

**Step 3: Insurance Verification** (3-5 Days):

- Foundation verifies telemedicine coverage (some plans don't cover out-of-state telemedicine)
- Obtain prior authorization (if required)
- Negotiate cash-pay rate (if insurance doesn't cover—Foundation may cover cost)

**Step 4: Medical Records Transfer** (1 Week):

- Foundation coordinates records transfer:
  - Contact patient's local doctor → request records
  - Upload to specialist's EHR or secure portal
- Include: Spirometry, CT scans, lab work (AAT level, genotype), treatment history

**Step 5: Technology Setup** (Before Appointment):

- Foundation's Patient Navigator calls patient:
  - Test video platform (Zoom, Doxy.me, or specialist's EHR video)
  - Help download apps, create accounts, test camera/mic
  - Send appointment link, instructions
- Provide tech support (if patient not tech-savvy—walk through step-by-step)

**Step 6: Telemedicine Appointment**:

- Patient meets with specialist (video visit, 30-60 min)
- Specialist reviews records, discusses symptoms, recommends treatment
- Provides prescriptions (e-prescribed to patient's pharmacy), referrals, test orders

**Step 7: Post-Visit Coordination** (After Appointment):

- Foundation follows up with patient:
  - Received prescriptions? Any issues?
  - Specialist recommended tests (e.g., CT scan)—need help scheduling locally?
  - Specialist recommended augmentation therapy—need help finding infusion center?
- Coordinate with local PCP (share specialist's recommendations, ensure continuity of care)

**Step 8: Ongoing Support**:

- Periodic follow-up telemedicine visits (every 3-6 months)
- Remote monitoring (if patient has home monitoring devices—see below)

---

### Specialist Recruitment

**How to Recruit Specialists**:

**Step 1: Identify Target Specialists**:

- Pulmonologists who publish AATD research
- Physicians at AATD Centers of Excellence
- Doctors who serve on Alpha-1 Foundation Medical Advisory Board

**Step 2: Outreach**:

- Personal email from Foundation CEO or Medical Director
- Invitation to partner (offer Foundation's services—patient referrals, records coordination)
- Benefits for specialists:
  - **Patient referrals** (Foundation sends patients from across country)
  - **Research opportunities** (access to patient registry, clinical trial recruitment)
  - **Reduced administrative burden** (Foundation handles scheduling, records, insurance)

**Step 3: Onboarding**:

- Telemedicine setup (ensure specialist's EHR supports video visits)
- Training (Foundation's coordination process, patient portal)
- Credentialing (if needed—some states require out-of-state physicians to be licensed in patient's state)

**Step 4: Launch**:

- Add specialist to Foundation's directory (website, patient navigator referrals)
- Promote partnership (press release, social media)

---

### Interstate Licensure (Barrier)

**Challenge**: Most states require physicians to be licensed in the state where the PATIENT is located (not where doctor is located)

**Example**: Patient in Wyoming sees telemedicine specialist in Colorado → Specialist must have Wyoming medical license

**Solution 1: Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC)**:

- 40 states participate (streamlined process for physicians to get licensed in multiple states)
- Foundation can support specialists (cover IMLC application fees—$700-$1,000)

**Solution 2: Emergency/Temporary Waivers**:

- Some states waived out-of-state licensure requirements during COVID-19
- Advocate for permanent telemedicine reciprocity (state policy advocacy)

**Solution 3: In-State Specialists**:

- Recruit at least 1 AATD-knowledgeable pulmonologist per state (even if not world-class expert—better than nothing)

---

## Technology Support

### Patient Tech Assistance

**Common Patient Tech Challenges**:

- ❌ "I don't have a smartphone/computer"
- ❌ "I don't know how to use Zoom"
- ❌ "My internet is too slow for video"
- ❌ "I can't figure out how to log into the patient portal"

**Foundation Solutions**:

**1. Device Loan Program**:

- Lend tablets (iPads or Android tablets) to patients without devices
- Pre-loaded with video visit apps (Zoom, Doxy.me, etc.)
- Include instructions, tech support hotline

**2. Tech Support Hotline**:

- 1-800-AATD-TECH (phone support—walk patients through setup)

**3. Step-by-Step Guides**:

- Video tutorials (how to join Zoom call, test camera/mic)
- Printed instructions (mailed to patients who prefer paper)
- Available in multiple languages (Spanish, etc.)

**4. In-Person Assistance** (for local patients):

- Volunteers help patients attend telemedicine visit from Foundation office, library, community center
- Volunteer sets up tech, ensures patient can see/hear specialist

**5. Low-Bandwidth Solutions**:

- Phone-only visits (if patient's internet too slow for video)
- Reduce video quality (lower resolution uses less bandwidth)

---

### Video Platforms

**Options**:

**1. Specialist's EHR Video** (Epic MyChart, Cerner, etc.):

- **Pros**: HIPAA-compliant, integrated with medical records, billing
- **Cons**: Patient must create account, navigate unfamiliar portal

**2. Zoom for Healthcare**:

- **Pros**: HIPAA-compliant (if Business Associate Agreement in place), user-friendly, widely used
- **Cons**: Requires specialist to have Zoom Healthcare account

**3. Doxy.me**:

- **Pros**: HIPAA-compliant, no download required (browser-based), simple
- **Cons**: Less robust features than Zoom

**Foundation's Role**: Work with specialists to standardize platform (reduce patient confusion)

---

## Insurance Navigation

### Telemedicine Coverage Challenges

**Barrier 1: Out-of-State Telemedicine**:

- Some insurance plans only cover in-state providers
- **Solution**: Verify coverage before scheduling, negotiate exceptions (or Foundation covers cost)

**Barrier 2: Prior Authorization**:

- Some plans require PA for telemedicine specialist visits (especially out-of-network)
- **Solution**: Foundation assists with PA (submit documentation, appeal denials)

**Barrier 3: Parity Laws**:

- Not all states require insurance to cover telemedicine at same rate as in-person
- **Solution**: Advocacy (push for telemedicine parity laws in all states)

---

### Uninsured/Underinsured Patients

**Challenge**: Patient can't afford specialist visit (cash-pay rate: $300-$600 per visit)

**Foundation Solutions**:

**1. Pro Bono Specialist Network**:

- Some specialists willing to see uninsured patients for free (charity care)
- Foundation coordinates (screen patients, match with pro bono specialists)

**2. Discounted Cash-Pay Rates**:

- Negotiate with specialists (discounted rate for Foundation-referred patients—e.g., $150 instead of $400)

**3. Patient Assistance Fund**:

- Foundation covers cost of telemedicine visit for low-income patients
- Means-tested (based on income, household size)
- Budget: $50K/year (Year 1—covers ~200 visits at $250 average)

---

## Remote Monitoring

### Home Monitoring Devices (Loan Program)

**Why Remote Monitoring Matters**:

- Track disease progression (lung function, oxygen levels) between telemedicine visits
- Early detection of exacerbations (catch problems before hospitalization)
- Empower patients (self-monitoring → better disease management)

---

### Devices Provided (Loan Program)

**1. Pulse Oximeter** ($30-$50):

- Measures oxygen saturation (SpO2—should be > 95% normally)
- Alerts if SpO2 drops (may need supplemental oxygen)
- **Use**: Daily monitoring (patients on oxygen, patients with low FEV1)

**2. Portable Spirometer** ($200-$500):

- Measures lung function (FEV1, FVC—same metrics as office spirometry)
- Track disease progression (monthly or quarterly home spirometry)
- **Use**: Patients on augmentation therapy (monitor treatment efficacy)

**3. Blood Pressure Monitor** ($30-$50):

- Monitor for pulmonary hypertension (common comorbidity in AATD lung disease)
- **Use**: Patients with suspected PH

**4. Weight Scale** ($20-$50):

- Track weight (fluid retention = possible heart failure, common in advanced lung disease)
- **Use**: Patients with severe disease, patients on transplant list

---

### Device Loan Process

**Step 1: Patient Qualifies**:

- Telemedicine patient (no local access to specialist)
- Needs home monitoring (specialist recommends)
- Can't afford to purchase device

**Step 2: Foundation Ships Device**:

- Mailed to patient's home (with instructions, return label)
- Video tutorial (how to use device)
- Tech support hotline (troubleshooting)

**Step 3: Patient Uses Device**:

- Frequency depends on device (daily pulse ox, monthly spirometry)
- Log results (paper or app)
- Share with specialist (at telemedicine visits or if concerning readings)

**Step 4: Return Device** (When No Longer Needed):

- Patient mails back to Foundation (prepaid label)
- Device refurbished, loaned to next patient

**Cost** (Year 1):

- 100 devices (50 pulse oximeters, 40 spirometers, 10 BP monitors)
- Total: ~$20K (purchase) + $5K/year (shipping, refurbishment)
