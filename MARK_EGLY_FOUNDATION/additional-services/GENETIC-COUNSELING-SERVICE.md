## Why Genetic Counseling Matters

### AATD is Genetic—Families Need to Know

**Inheritance Pattern**:

- **Autosomal Codominant**: Inherit one SERPINA1 gene from each parent (2 copies total)
- **Most Common Genotypes**:
  - **MM**: Normal (2 normal genes—most common)
  - **MZ**: Carrier (1 normal, 1 Z mutation—AAT level 50-60% of normal, usually asymptomatic)
  - **ZZ**: AATD (2 Z mutations—AAT level 10-20% of normal, high risk of lung/liver disease)
  - **SZ**: AATD (1 S mutation, 1 Z mutation—AAT level 30-40% of normal, moderate risk)
  - **SS**: Carrier (2 S mutations—AAT level 60-70% of normal, usually asymptomatic)

**Key Points**:

- If you have AATD (ZZ), your children will be at least carriers (MZ)
- If you're a carrier (MZ) and partner is carrier (MZ), 25% chance each child has AATD (ZZ)
- If you have AATD (ZZ) and partner is carrier (MZ), 50% chance each child has AATD (ZZ)

### Why AATD Patients Need Genetic Counseling

**Reason #1: Understand Their Own Results**:

- **Confusion**: "I'm ZZ—what does that mean?" "Will I definitely get lung disease?"
- **Prognosis**: Different genotypes → different disease risk (ZZ > SZ > MZ > MM)
- **Treatment Decisions**: ZZ → eligible for augmentation therapy; MZ → not eligible (usually)

**Reason #2: Family Screening**:

- **First-degree relatives** (parents, siblings, children) have 50% chance of carrying at least one Z allele
- **Early Detection**: Finding AATD early (before symptoms) → prevention strategies (avoid smoking, occupational hazards)
- **Statistics**: For every 1 AATD patient identified, 4-5 family members test positive (ZZ, SZ, or MZ)
- **Barrier**: Most patients don't tell family members (don't understand genetics, fear causing worry, family estrangement)

**Reason #3: Family Planning**:

- **Reproductive Decisions**: Should I have children? Risk of passing AATD?
- **Guilt**: "I gave my child this disease" (parents of children with AATD)
- **Options**: Natural conception, adoption, PGD (select AATD-free embryos), sperm/egg donor

**Reason #4: Psychosocial Support**:

- **Guilt**: "I passed this to my children"
- **Anxiety**: "Will my kids get sick?"
- **Family Dynamics**: Blame ("Your side of the family caused this"), secrets ("Don't tell grandma—she'll worry")
- **Genetic counselors trained in psychosocial support** (not just genetics education—also emotional processing)

### Patient Stories (Why Genetic Counseling Matters)

**Story 1: Cascade Testing Saves Lives**:

- 45-year-old male diagnosed with AATD (ZZ), FEV1 40%, on augmentation therapy
- Genetic counselor creates family pedigree (3 siblings, 4 adult children)
- All 7 family members tested → 2 siblings have AATD (ZZ), 1 child has AATD (ZZ)
- **Brother (52)**: ZZ, FEV1 70%, asymptomatic → started augmentation therapy early (before symptoms) → prevented lung disease
- **Daughter (23)**: ZZ, FEV1 95%, asymptomatic → counseled to avoid smoking, environmental hazards → will preserve lung function
- **Outcome**: Cascade testing identified 3 previously undiagnosed AATD patients (early intervention → better outcomes)

**Story 2: Family Planning Decision**:

- 28-year-old female, ZZ genotype, FEV1 85%, wants children
- Partner: MZ genotype (carrier)
- **Risk**: 50% chance each child has AATD (ZZ), 50% chance carrier (MZ)
- Genetic counseling:
  - Options: (1) Natural conception (accept 50% risk), (2) PGD (IVF + genetic testing—select MZ embryos, avoid ZZ), (3) Egg donor (partner's MZ gene eliminated), (4) Adoption
  - Discuss pros/cons (cost, ethics, emotional impact)
  - Patient chooses PGD → 2 healthy children (MZ carriers, not ZZ)
- **Outcome**: Patient able to have biological children without AATD (reduced guilt, anxiety)

**Story 3: Pediatric AATD**:

- Parents of 5-year-old with AATD (ZZ)—diagnosed after recurrent lung infections
- Parents devastated, guilty ("We gave her this disease")
- Genetic counseling:
  - Explain inheritance (both parents are carriers—MZ—neither knew)
  - Reassure: Not their fault (genetic lottery)
  - Discuss prognosis (children with ZZ → variable outcomes—some never develop symptoms, some develop liver disease)
  - Management plan (avoid smoking exposure, monitor liver function, pulmonologist follow-up)
- **Outcome**: Parents less guilty, more empowered (understand disease, know how to protect child)

## Genetic Counseling Sessions

### Session Structure (60 Minutes)

**Pre-Session**:

- Patient completes intake form (family history, medical history, testing results, questions)
- Genetic counselor reviews (prepares materials, researches questions)

**Session Agenda**:

**1. Introduction** (5 min):

- Counselor explains role (educator, not physician—won't diagnose or treat, but will explain genetics)
- Patient shares goals for session ("I want to understand my test results," "I want to know if I should test my kids")

**2. Family History & Pedigree** (10 min):

- Counselor creates family tree (3 generations—grandparents, parents, patient, siblings, children)
- Mark who has AATD, respiratory/liver disease, early death (identify patterns)
- Identify at-risk relatives (who should be tested?)

**3. Genetics Education** (15 min):

- Explain AATD genetics:
  - SERPINA1 gene (chromosome 14—makes AAT protein)
  - Inheritance pattern (autosomal codominant—need 2 copies, one from each parent)
  - Common genotypes (MM, MZ, ZZ, SZ, SS)
  - Genotype-phenotype correlation (ZZ → high risk, MZ → low risk, etc.)
- Use visuals (Punnett squares, diagrams—make it understandable)

**4. Test Results Interpretation** (10 min):

- Review patient's genetic test results (genotype—e.g., ZZ)
- Explain what it means:
  - **ZZ**: Severe AATD (AAT level 10-20% normal), high risk of lung disease (emphysema—if smoke or exposed to lung irritants), moderate risk of liver disease (10-15% develop cirrhosis)
  - **What to do**: Avoid smoking (most important!), avoid occupational hazards (dust, fumes), consider augmentation therapy (if lung disease develops), monitor liver function (annual LFTs)
- Answer questions ("Will I definitely get sick?" "How long will I live?" "Can it be cured?")

**5. Family Screening Recommendations** (10 min):

- Who should be tested? (First-degree relatives—parents, siblings, children)
- Why? (Early detection → prevention, treatment)
- How? (Blood test—AAT level + genetic test—genotype)
- Foundation can help coordinate (Family Testing Coordination—see below)

**6. Family Planning Discussion** (If Applicable—10 min):

- If patient wants children (or has young children):
  - Risk of passing AATD (based on patient + partner's genotypes)
  - Reproductive options (natural conception, PGD, donor gametes, adoption)
  - Refer to Family Planning Counseling (separate session—see below)

**7. Psychosocial Support** (5 min):

- How are you feeling? (guilt, anxiety, anger, fear?)
- Normalize emotions ("These feelings are common")
- Offer support resources (Peer Counseling, support groups, therapist referrals)

**8. Wrap-Up & Next Steps** (5 min):

- Summary (key takeaways)
- Written materials (summary letter, family testing recommendations, resources)
- Follow-up (schedule second session if needed, connect to Foundation programs)

---

### Post-Session

**Deliverables**:

- **Summary Letter** (2-3 pages):
  - Patient's genotype, interpretation
  - Family pedigree (diagram)
  - Family screening recommendations (list of relatives to test)
  - Resources (Foundation programs, support groups, AATD organizations)
- **Educational Materials**:
  - "Understanding Your AATD Genetics" (patient-friendly handout)
  - Family letter template (for patient to share with relatives—explain AATD, recommend testing)

---

## Family Testing Coordination

### Cascade Testing (Systematic Family Screening)

**What is Cascade Testing?**:

- When one person diagnosed with AATD → systematically test all first-degree relatives (identify additional cases)
- **Evidence**: Most effective way to find undiagnosed AATD patients (1 index case → 4-5 relatives test positive)

**Foundation's Role**:

- Coordinate cascade testing (make it easy for patients to get family members tested)
- Remove barriers (cost, logistics, family communication)

---

### Family Testing Process

**Step 1: Identify At-Risk Relatives**:

- Genetic counselor creates family pedigree (during counseling session)
- List first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children—ages 18+)
- Patient consent (share names, contact info—or patient will contact family independently)

**Step 2: Family Outreach**:

- **Option A**: Patient contacts family (Foundation provides family letter template—explains AATD, recommends testing)
- **Option B**: Foundation contacts family (with patient's permission—mails letter, follows up by phone)

**Step 3: Testing Coordination**:

- Foundation coordinates AATD testing:
  - Partner with lab (Quest, LabCorp—discounted rate for family testing)
  - Send test kit to family member's home (finger-stick or saliva—mail back to lab)
  - OR provide lab requisition (family member goes to local lab)
- **Cost**: Free (Foundation covers—or family member's insurance covers if ordered by doctor)

**Step 4: Results & Counseling**:

- Lab sends results to Foundation (with patient/family consent)
- Genetic counselor calls family member (explain results—10-15 min phone call)
- If positive (ZZ, SZ, or MZ), offer full genetic counseling session (60 min)

**Step 5: Medical Follow-Up**:

- If family member has AATD (ZZ or SZ), connect to:
  - AATD specialist (pulmonologist, hepatologist)
  - Foundation programs (patient navigation, telemedicine, support groups)
  - Treatment (augmentation therapy if indicated)

---

### Family Testing Targets

**Year 1**:

- 100 index patients (newly diagnosed AATD patients)
- Average 5 first-degree relatives per index patient = 500 relatives
- 50% participation rate = 250 relatives tested
- 40% positive rate (ZZ, SZ, or MZ) = 100 newly diagnosed AATD patients or carriers

**Year 5**:

- 500 index patients
- 2,500 relatives identified
- 1,250 tested (50% participation)
- 500 newly diagnosed

---

## Family Planning Counseling

### For Prospective Parents with AATD

**Who Needs Family Planning Counseling**:

- AATD patients (ZZ, SZ) who want children
- Carriers (MZ) with partner who is also carrier (MZ)
- Parents of children with AATD (considering more children)

**Key Questions**:

1. **What's the risk my child will have AATD?**
2. **What are my reproductive options?**
3. **How do I decide what's right for me?**

---

### Risk Assessment

**Scenario 1: Both Parents Have AATD (ZZ × ZZ)**:

- **Risk**: 100% of children will have AATD (ZZ)
- **Counseling**: Discuss severity (not all ZZ patients get severely ill—variable expressivity), prevention (avoid smoking, lung irritants)

**Scenario 2: One Parent Has AATD (ZZ), Other is Carrier (MZ)**:

- **Risk**: 50% ZZ (AATD), 50% MZ (carrier)
- **Most Common Scenario** (ZZ patients often partner with MZ—higher prevalence in some populations)

**Scenario 3: One Parent Has AATD (ZZ), Other is Normal (MM)**:

- **Risk**: 100% of children will be carriers (MZ)—not AATD
- **Low Risk Scenario** (children will be healthy)

**Scenario 4: Both Parents Are Carriers (MZ × MZ)**:

- **Risk**: 25% ZZ (AATD), 50% MZ (carrier), 25% MM (normal)
- **Often Discovered After Child Born with AATD** (parents didn't know they were carriers)

**Scenario 5: One Parent is Carrier (MZ), Other is Normal (MM)**:

- **Risk**: 50% MZ (carrier), 50% MM (normal)—no AATD
- **Low Risk Scenario**

---

### Reproductive Options

**Option 1: Natural Conception**:

- **Pros**: Simple, low-cost, no medical intervention
- **Cons**: Risk of child having AATD (depending on parents' genotypes)
- **Counseling**: Discuss risk tolerance (some families accept risk—"We'll love our child no matter what"), others uncomfortable

**Option 2: Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD)**:

- **What It Is**: IVF + genetic testing of embryos (before implantation—test for AATD, select unaffected embryos)
- **Process**:
  1. IVF (egg retrieval, fertilization in lab)
  2. Embryo biopsy (Day 5-6—remove a few cells from each embryo)
  3. Genetic testing (test for Z allele—identify ZZ, MZ, MM embryos)
  4. Embryo selection (transfer only MZ or MM embryos—avoid ZZ)
  5. Pregnancy
- **Success Rate**: 40-60% live birth per IVF cycle (lower if patient older, fewer embryos)
- **Cost**: $20K-$30K per cycle (IVF $15K-$20K + PGD $5K-$10K)
- **Insurance**: Most insurance doesn't cover (some states mandate IVF coverage—but rarely PGD)
- **Pros**: Can have biological children without AATD (or select carriers only, avoid ZZ)
- **Cons**: Expensive, invasive, emotionally taxing, no guarantee of pregnancy, ethical concerns (some patients uncomfortable with embryo selection)

**Option 3: Prenatal Diagnosis + Selective Termination**:

- **What It Is**: Conceive naturally, test fetus (amniocentesis or CVS), terminate if AATD
- **Process**:
  1. Natural conception
  2. Prenatal testing (Week 10-20—amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling)
  3. Genetic testing (test fetal DNA for Z allele)
  4. If ZZ (AATD), option to terminate pregnancy
- **Cost**: $1K-$3K (prenatal testing—usually covered by insurance if high-risk)
- **Pros**: Less expensive than PGD, can conceive naturally
- **Cons**: Requires termination (if fetus has AATD—ethically difficult for some), late termination (Week 10-20—further along than most abortions), risk of miscarriage from amnio (1%)

**Option 4: Donor Gametes** (Sperm or Egg Donor):

- **What It Is**: Use donor sperm (if father has AATD) or donor egg (if mother has AATD) → eliminate AATD risk
- **Process**:
  1. Select donor (sperm bank or egg donor agency—screen for AATD, ensure donor is MM)
  2. IVF (if using donor egg) or IUI/natural conception (if using donor sperm)
  3. Pregnancy
- **Cost**: Donor sperm ($500-$1K per vial + IUI $500-$1K = $1K-$2K per attempt), Donor egg ($20K-$40K—egg donor compensation + IVF)
- **Pros**: Eliminates AATD risk, less expensive than PGD (if using donor sperm)
- **Cons**: Child not genetically related to one parent (psychological impact—some parents struggle), costly (if donor egg)

**Option 5: Adoption**:

- **What It Is**: Adopt child (no genetic connection—no AATD risk)
- **Cost**: $20K-$50K (domestic adoption), $30K-$60K (international)
- **Pros**: Eliminates AATD risk, provide home to child in need
- **Cons**: Expensive, lengthy process (1-3 years), no genetic connection

**Option 6: Childfree by Choice**:

- **What It Is**: Decide not to have children (due to AATD risk, personal choice)
- **Counseling**: Explore motivations (fear of passing disease? concerns about own health? genuinely don't want children?), ensure informed decision

---

### Decision-Making Support

**Genetic Counselor's Role**:

- **Non-Directive**: Counselors don't tell patients what to do (present options, support decision)
- **Values Clarification**: Help patients identify their values (what's most important? genetic connection? avoiding AATD? cost? ethics?)
- **Emotional Support**: Validate feelings (guilt, fear, grief)
- **Resource Connection**: Refer to fertility specialists, adoption agencies, financial assistance (PGD funding—some nonprofits offer grants)

## Pediatric Genetics

### For Parents of Children with AATD

**Common Concerns**:

- 😟 **Guilt**: "I gave my child this disease" (both parents are carriers—didn't know)
- 😟 **Prognosis**: "Will my child get sick?" "Will they have a normal life?"
- 😟 **Management**: "What should I do?" (monitoring, prevention, treatment)
- 😟 **Disclosure**: "Should I tell my child?" "When?" "How?"
- 😟 **Siblings**: "Should I test my other children?" "What if they have it too?"

---

### Pediatric Genetic Counseling Session

**Topics Covered**:

**1. Inheritance Explanation**:

- Both parents are carriers (MZ)—didn't know
- 25% chance each child has AATD (ZZ)—genetic lottery, not parents' fault
- Reassure: Not preventable, not their fault

**2. Prognosis for Children with AATD**:

- **Variable Expressivity**: Some ZZ children never develop symptoms, some develop liver disease (10-15%), few develop early lung disease
- **Most Important**: Avoid smoking (never start), avoid secondhand smoke (parents must not smoke around child)
- **Positive Message**: With prevention (no smoking, avoid lung irritants), many ZZ patients live normal lifespans

**3. Medical Management**:

- **Monitoring**: Annual checkups (pediatrician or pediatric pulmonologist), liver function tests (annual—monitor for liver disease)
- **Prevention**: Avoid smoking exposure, allergens, air pollution
- **Vaccination**: Up-to-date vaccines (flu, pneumonia, COVID—prevent respiratory infections)
- **Treatment**: Augmentation therapy NOT typically used in children (unless severe lung disease—rare)

**4. Disclosure to Child**:

- **When to Tell**: Depends on age (young children—simple explanation, teenagers—full explanation)
- **How to Tell**: Age-appropriate language ("Your lungs need extra protection—that's why we avoid smoke"), emphasize positives ("You can do anything—just take care of your lungs")
- **What to Say**: "You have a condition called Alpha-1. It's genetic (from mom and dad). It means your lungs need extra care. No smoking ever. With good care, you'll be healthy."

**5. Sibling Testing**:

- Recommend testing siblings (25% chance each sibling also ZZ)
- Early detection → prevention (avoid smoking, monitor)
- When to test: After age 18 (adult decision) OR earlier if symptoms (lung infections, liver disease)

**6. Future Family Planning**:

- If child with AATD (ZZ) grows up and wants children → genetic counseling (before reproductive age—discuss options)
