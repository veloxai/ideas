### Service Philosophy

**"Like Having a Best Friend Who's an AATD Expert"**:

- Personal relationship (Advocate knows donor's medical history, preferences, fears, goals)
- Always available (no waiting on hold, leaving voicemails, getting transferred)
- Proactive (Advocate anticipates needs, reaches out before problems arise)
- Discretion (high-touch, confidential, respectful of privacy)

**Model**: Inspired by:

- **Concierge medicine** (membership-based primary care—Dr. knows you, always available, unhurried)
- **Five-star hospitality** (Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons—anticipate needs, exceed expectations, personalized service)
- **Family office services** (wealthy families' personal staff—handle complex issues, coordinate specialists, ensure excellence)

---

## Why a Concierge Service

### Donor Stewardship & Retention

**Challenge**: Major donors need exceptional stewardship (to retain, cultivate for larger gifts)

**Traditional Approach** (Inadequate):

- Annual gala invitation, quarterly newsletter, thank-you letter (impersonal, transactional)
- Donors feel like ATMs (asked for money, no meaningful relationship)

**Concierge Service Approach** (Transformative):

- Deliver tangible value (not just recognition, but real support for donor or their loved one with AATD)
- Build deep relationship (Advocate becomes trusted advisor, confidant—donor feels cared for)
- Demonstrate impact (donor sees Foundation's work firsthand—through their own experience)
- Inspire larger gifts (donors give more when they feel connected, see impact, trust organization)

**Research on Donor Retention**:

- **Major donors who receive personalized services** are 3x more likely to increase giving (vs. donors who receive standard recognition)
- **Experiential philanthropy** (donors experience programs, not just fund them) = higher satisfaction, retention, lifetime value

---

### Competitive Advantage (Fundraising)

**Other AATD Organizations** (Don't Offer Concierge):

- Alpha-1 Foundation: Standard patient services (available to all—not differentiated for donors)
- AlphaNet: Excellent Disease Management Program—but no donor-exclusive tier

**Mark Egly Foundation Differentiator**:

- ✅ **Only AATD organization** offering premium concierge service (unique value proposition for high-net-worth donors)
- ✅ **Appeals to affluent patients**: "If I donate $50K, I get exceptional support for myself or my family member with AATD" (self-interested philanthropy is OK—and effective)
- ✅ **Appeals to grateful patients**: "Foundation helped me—I want to give back AND ensure my children (who have AATD) get best care"

### Patient Stories (Hypothetical—Illustrate Value)

**Story 1: Busy Executive with ZZ AATD**:

- 55-year-old CEO, ZZ genotype, FEV1 50%, on augmentation therapy
- Extremely busy (works 80 hours/week), travels constantly, no time to manage medical care
- Before Concierge: Skipped pulmonologist appointments (too busy), missed infusions (forgot to schedule), no time to deal with insurance (delayed prior authorizations)
- **With Concierge**: Personal Advocate handles everything—schedules appointments (works around CEO's travel), arranges infusions (at convenient locations—home, office), fights insurance battles (CEO never talks to insurance company), proactive reminders (text night before appointment)
- **Outcome**: CEO's health stabilizes (adherent to treatment, regular monitoring), CEO donates $100K (grateful for service, sees Foundation's value)

**Story 2: Wealthy Grandparent (Grandchild Has AATD)**:

- 75-year-old retired executive, grandson (age 8) diagnosed ZZ AATD (neonatal cholestasis, liver disease)
- Grandparent wants best care for grandson (willing to pay anything), but family overwhelmed (young parents, first child, don't know how to navigate AATD)
- Before Foundation: Family sees local pediatrician (not AATD expert), liver enzymes elevated (concerning), no clear plan
- **With Concierge** (Grandparent donates $50K → family receives concierge service):
  - Advocate arranges consultation with top pediatric hepatologist (Cincinnati Children's—within 1 week)
  - Advocate coordinates travel (books flights for family, hotel near hospital, arranges childcare for during appointments)
  - Advocate obtains all records (from local doctor—sends to Cincinnati ahead of visit, so specialist prepared)
  - Advocate follows up post-visit (ensures family understands plan, schedules follow-up tests, answers questions)
- **Outcome**: Grandson gets expert care (liver disease stabilizing, excellent prognosis), family feels supported (stress reduced), grandparent donates another $100K (year 2—deeply grateful)

**Story 3: Board Member's Spouse (Newly Diagnosed)**:

- Board member's wife (age 50) diagnosed ZZ AATD (FEV1 65%, non-smoker, shocked by diagnosis)
- Board member loves Foundation (joined board because friend has AATD), wants best care for wife
- **With Concierge** (Automatic—board members receive concierge):
  - Advocate reaches out (within 24 hours of diagnosis), offers support, schedules meeting (video call—explain AATD, answer questions, create care plan)
  - Advocate arranges specialist appointment (Mayo Clinic—world-renowned AATD center, within 2 weeks)
  - Advocate coordinates insurance (prior authorization for augmentation therapy—approved in 1 week vs. typical 4-8 weeks)
  - Advocate provides quarterly health reviews (track FEV1, optimize treatment, proactive recommendations)
- **Outcome**: Wife's AATD well-managed (started treatment early, lung function stable), board member becomes champion (recruits 5 new major donors—"Foundation saved my wife's life")

## Service Components

### 1. Dedicated Personal Advocate

**Assignment**:

- Each concierge client assigned senior Patient Navigator (5+ years experience, deep AATD knowledge)
- Advocate-to-client ratio: 1:25 (low caseload—ensures personalized attention)

**Advocate Responsibilities**:

- Serve as single point of contact (client calls/texts Advocate for any need)
- Know client's case intimately (medical history, preferences, goals, family situation)
- Anticipate needs (proactive—reach out before appointments, after test results, during transitions)
- Coordinate all aspects of care (see detailed services below)

**Relationship-Building**:

- Introductory meeting (60-90 min—in-person or video, get to know client, assess needs, create personalized care plan)
- Regular check-ins (monthly phone calls—"How are you feeling? Any concerns? Upcoming appointments?")
- Always available (respond to texts/calls within 1 hour during business hours, 4 hours nights/weekends)

---

### 2. VIP Specialist Access

**Challenge**: Top AATD specialists have 3-6 month wait times (Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, National Jewish)

**Concierge Solution**:

- Foundation has relationships with specialists (due to research funding, conference partnerships, referrals)
- Advocate contacts specialist directly (bypasses appointment line): "I have a Legacy Circle donor who needs urgent consultation—can you see them this month?"
- Specialists prioritize Foundation concierge clients (goodwill, Foundation supports their research)
- **Result**: Appointments within 1-2 weeks (vs. 3-6 months)

**Specialist Network** (VIP Access):

- Cleveland Clinic: Dr. James Stoller (world's leading AATD expert)
- National Jewish Health: Dr. Robert Sandhaus (AATD researcher, clinician)
- Mayo Clinic: AATD program (pulmonology, hepatology)
- UCSF: Liver transplant team (AATD liver disease)
- 20+ other top specialists nationwide

---

### 3. Comprehensive Care Coordination

**Advocate Manages Entire Care Journey**:

**Appointment Scheduling**:

- Advocate schedules all appointments (pulmonologist, PCP, hepatologist, genetic counselor, etc.)
- Coordinates timing (cluster appointments on same day—reduce travel)
- Prepares for visits (sends pre-visit summary to doctor—recent test results, medication changes, current concerns)

**Medical Records Management**:

- Advocate obtains all records (from all providers—hospital, PCP, specialists)
- Sends records ahead of appointments (so new doctor has complete history)
- Maintains centralized record (in Foundation Medical Records Portal—client has access)

**Test Result Follow-Up**:

- Advocate tracks all pending tests (PFT, CT scan, labs)
- Calls client when results available (explains results, answers questions, schedules follow-up if needed)
- Ensures no results fall through cracks (common problem—doctor orders test, forgets to follow up)

**Medication Management**:

- Advocate maintains medication list (current, updated after every visit)
- Coordinates refills (calls pharmacy, ensures prescriptions filled on time)
- Alerts client to potential drug interactions (if new med prescribed—checks against current list)

**Provider Communication**:

- Advocate facilitates communication between providers (pulmonologist says "I want hepatologist's opinion on liver meds"—Advocate coordinates, summarizes, ensures both doctors aligned)

---

### 4. Insurance Advocacy (White-Glove)

**Advocate Handles All Insurance Issues**:

**Prior Authorizations**:

- Advocate submits (gathers documentation, completes forms, submits to insurance)
- Follows up (calls insurance weekly—"What's status? What else do you need?")
- **Result**: PAs approved faster (2-4 weeks vs. typical 6-12 weeks—Advocate knows how to navigate system)

**Appeals**:

- If insurance denies (augmentation therapy, oxygen, specialist visit), Advocate handles appeal
- Gathers evidence (peer-reviewed studies, doctor's letter, treatment guidelines)
- Writes appeal letter (compelling, medically sound)
- Submits + follows up (escalates to external review if needed)
- **Result**: Higher appeal success rate (80% vs. typical 50%—Advocate is expert)

**Out-of-Network Coverage**:

- If client wants to see specialist out-of-network (e.g., Mayo Clinic, but insurance is UHC—Mayo not in network), Advocate negotiates with insurance
- Advocate: "Patient needs Mayo's expertise (only 5 AATD experts in US)—will you cover as in-network exception?"
- **Result**: Often successful (insurance agrees—saves them money vs. denying, then paying for complications from suboptimal care)

**Claims Issues**:

- Advocate monitors claims (ensures insurance pays, resolves billing errors)
- Client never receives surprise bills (Advocate handles—disputes, negotiates payment plans if needed)

---

### 5. Travel Concierge

**Medical Travel Fully Managed**:

**Before Trip**:

- Advocate books everything (flights, hotel, ground transportation)
- Arranges oxygen (if client on oxygen—coordinates delivery to hotel, backup tanks, contact DME at destination)
- Researches restaurants (near hotel, dietary restrictions accommodated)
- Sends itinerary (detailed—flight times, hotel confirmation, doctor's address, emergency contacts)

**During Trip**:

- Advocate available 24/7 (if issues—flight delayed, oxygen delivery failed, medical emergency)
- Problem-solving (Advocate handles—rebooks flights, arranges backup oxygen, calls doctor if medical issue)

**After Trip**:

**Transplant Relocation** (Special Support):

- If client needs lung/liver transplant (must relocate to transplant center for 6-12 weeks), Advocate arranges extended stay
- Books extended-stay hotel or apartment (furnished, near hospital)
- Arranges caregiver accommodations (spouse, family member)
- Coordinates with Foundation Transplant Housing (if available in that city—free lodging)

---

### 6. Clinical Trial Fast-Track

**Priority Access to Trials**:

- Foundation maintains relationships with researchers (fund trials, provide patient registry)
- Advocate contacts trial sites directly: "I have a concierge client (major donor) who's eligible for your gene therapy trial—can we expedite screening?"
- **Result**: Faster enrollment (weeks vs. months—skip waitlists)

**Trial Support**:

- Advocate coordinates screening visits (schedule, travel, records)
- Explains trial (risks, benefits, time commitment—helps client make informed decision)
- Manages trial logistics (appointments, travel reimbursement, communication with trial coordinator)

---

### 7. Second Opinion Coordination

**Fast-Track Expert Opinions**:

- Client wants second opinion (e.g., local pulmonologist says "You need lung transplant"—client wants confirmation)
- Advocate arranges consultations with 2-3 top AATD experts (Cleveland Clinic, National Jewish, Mayo)
- **Timeline**: Within 1 week (vs. typical 3-6 months—VIP access)

**Advocate Prepares**:

- Schedules consultations (video calls or in-person—based on client preference)
- Summarizes opinions (after consults—written summary comparing all experts' recommendations)

**Decision Support**:

---

### 8. Quarterly Health Reviews

**In-Depth Review** (Every 3 Months):

- Advocate reviews all recent data (FEV1 tests, labs, imaging, hospitalizations, symptoms)
- Identifies trends (FEV1 declining faster than expected? Exacerbations increasing?)
- Optimization opportunities (e.g., "You're on albuterol PRN—should you start long-acting bronchodilator?" "Liver enzymes elevated—time to see hepatologist?")
- Proactive recommendations (e.g., "Flu season coming—schedule flu shot" "FEV1 < 40%—time to discuss transplant evaluation")

**Written Report**:

- Advocate sends summary (2-3 pages—health status, trends, recommendations, action items)

---

---

### Not For Sale (Preserves Integrity)

**Important**: Concierge service is **donor benefit**, not **fee-for-service**

**Why Not Sell?**:

- ❌ **Mission conflict**: Foundation's mission is to help all AATD patients (not just wealthy)—selling concierge would create two-tier system (rich patients get VIP care, others get standard—unethical)
- ❌ **Tax implications**: If sold, concierge becomes commercial activity (taxable income, unrelated business income tax—complicates 501(c)(3) status)
- ❌ **Donor perception**: Donors want to support Foundation's mission (help all patients)—if concierge is for-profit, feels transactional (not philanthropic)

**By Making It Donor Benefit**:

- ✅ **Aligns with mission**: Donor gives to help all patients (donation funds general programs)—concierge is "thank you" gift (not quid pro quo)
- ✅ **Tax-deductible**: Donation is fully tax-deductible (IRS allows incidental benefits—concierge service value < donation amount)
- ✅ **Feels philanthropic**: Donor feels they're supporting cause (and receiving exceptional stewardship)

---

### Family Member Eligibility

**Extended to Donor's Family**:

- If donor's spouse, child, sibling, or parent has AATD → they receive concierge service
