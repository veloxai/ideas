## Why Second Opinions Matter

### Medical Decision Complexity

**AATD Involves High-Stakes Decisions**:

- **Augmentation therapy**: Start or not? (Costs $100K-$200K/year, weekly infusions—want to be sure it's right decision)
- **Lung transplant**: Pursue evaluation? (Life-changing surgery, 5-year survival 50-60%, risks vs. benefits)
- **Liver transplant**: For pediatric patients (neonatal cholestasis—some resolve without transplant, some need urgent transplant—hard call)
- **Clinical trials**: Enroll in gene therapy trial? (Experimental, unknown risks, could be curative—need expert guidance)
- **Genetic testing**: Test children? (Carrier screening, ethical considerations, impact on insurability)

**First Doctor May Be Wrong** (Or Not AATD Expert):

- **Misdiagnosis**: 30% of AATD patients initially misdiagnosed (as asthma, COPD, bronchitis—AATD not considered)
- **Outdated treatment**: Community doctors may not know latest guidelines (augmentation therapy indications expanded, new transplant criteria)
- **Lack of AATD expertise**: Only ~50 AATD specialists nationwide (most doctors see 0-1 AATD patient in career—limited experience)

**Second Opinions Save Lives**:

- **Confirm diagnosis** (catch misdiagnoses—avoid wrong treatment)
- **Optimize treatment** (experts know nuances—when to start augmentation, which inhaler regimen, transplant timing)
- **Offer alternatives** (first doctor says "only option is transplant"—expert may suggest clinical trial, different management)
- **Provide reassurance** (if expert agrees with first doctor—patient feels confident proceeding)

---

### Barriers to Second Opinions (Current System)

**Why Patients Don't Get Second Opinions**:

- ❌ **Long wait times**: Top specialists have 3-6 month backlogs (patient can't wait—needs decision now)
- ❌ **Geographic barriers**: AATD experts concentrated in few cities (Denver, Cleveland, Boston—patients in rural areas can't travel)
- ❌ **Cost**: Second opinion consultations expensive ($500-$2,000—not always covered by insurance)
- ❌ **Complexity**: Patient must coordinate (request records, find expert, schedule appointment, travel—overwhelming for sick patient)
- ❌ **Fear of offending first doctor**: Patients worry "My doctor will be upset if I seek second opinion" (though ethically, doctors should support)

**Foundation's Fast-Track Service Eliminates These Barriers**

### Patient Stories

**Story 1: Transplant Decision**:

- 52-year-old male, ZZ AATD, FEV1 28%, frequent exacerbations (3 hospitalizations past year)
- Local pulmonologist: "You need lung transplant—I'm referring you for evaluation"
- Patient scared (transplant = major surgery, risks, lifelong immunosuppression), wants second opinion
- **Without Fast-Track**: Patient calls Cleveland Clinic (top AATD center)—first available appointment is 4 months away. Patient can't wait (deteriorating rapidly—may not survive 4 months).
- **With Fast-Track**: Patient contacts Foundation → Navigator arranges telemedicine consult with Cleveland Clinic expert (Dr. Stoller) within 1 week. Dr. Stoller reviews records, agrees transplant evaluation warranted, but suggests optimizing medical management first (increase pulmonary rehab, adjust inhalers, treat OSA if present) → try for 3-6 months, then re-evaluate. Patient implements changes → FEV1 improves to 32%, exacerbations reduce → delays transplant 2 years (better quality of life, more time to prepare).

**Story 2: Uncertain Diagnosis**:

- 35-year-old female, low AAT level (40 mg/dL—normal 150-350), but genotype testing shows MM (normal genotype—should have normal AAT)
- Local doctor confused: "Your AAT is low, but you don't have ZZ genotype—I don't know what's wrong"
- Patient worried (is it AATD? something else? do I need treatment?)
- **With Fast-Track**: Foundation arranges consult with genetic counselor + AATD geneticist (expert in rare variants). Expert reviews: Finds patient has rare null-null variant (genetic test missed it—needs sequencing, not just standard genotype test). Patient has severe AATD (AAT level < 11 μM) → needs augmentation therapy. **Outcome**: Correct diagnosis (caught by expert—would have been missed by community doctor), started treatment, lung function stabilizes.

**Story 3: Treatment Not Working**:

- 60-year-old male, ZZ AATD, on augmentation therapy 5 years (Prolastin, weekly infusions)
- Despite treatment, FEV1 declining rapidly (70% → 50% in 2 years—faster than expected)
- Patient: "Is augmentation therapy not working? Should I stop?"
- **With Fast-Track**: Foundation arranges consult with National Jewish Health expert. Expert reviews: Finds patient has low trough AAT levels (< 11 μM—should be > 11 during therapy, meaning dose insufficient). Expert recommends: Increase dose (from 60 mg/kg weekly to 120 mg/kg weekly—double dose, off-label but evidence-based for rapid decliners). Patient switches → trough levels improve → FEV1 decline slows. **Outcome**: Treatment optimized (expert knew advanced strategy—community doctor didn't).

## When to Seek Second Opinion

### Clinical Scenarios (Appropriate for Second Opinion)

**1. Major Treatment Decision**:

- Starting augmentation therapy (lifetime commitment, expensive, want confirmation it's indicated)
- Transplant evaluation (lung or liver—life-altering decision)
- Clinical trial enrollment (experimental therapy—weigh risks/benefits)
- Major surgery (lung volume reduction surgery, liver resection)

**2. Uncertain or Complex Diagnosis**:

- Low AAT level, but unclear genotype (rare variants, genetic testing inconclusive)
- Symptoms atypical for AATD (liver disease in adult ZZ patient—need expert to assess)
- Conflicting test results (AAT level normal on one test, low on another—which is correct?)

**3. Treatment Not Working**:

- On augmentation therapy, but FEV1 declining rapidly (is treatment effective? need dose adjustment?)
- Multiple exacerbations despite optimal medical management (what's missing?)
- Side effects from treatment (panniculitis from augmentation—how to manage?)

**4. Rare or Severe Presentation**:

- Pediatric AATD (neonatal cholestasis—need pediatric hepatologist expert)
- AATD-associated vasculitis (very rare—need rheumatology + AATD expert)
- Null-null genotype (ultra-rare—need geneticist)

**5. Dissatisfaction with Current Care**:

- Patient feels doctor dismisses concerns, doesn't listen, not knowledgeable about AATD
- Patient wants confirmation they're receiving best care (peace of mind)

**6. Before Irreversible Decision**:

- Stopping augmentation therapy (want expert to confirm it's OK to stop—before discontinuing)
- Declining transplant (want expert to confirm patient is making informed decision)

## Fast-Track Process

### Step 1: Patient Requests Second Opinion

**How to Request**:

- **Phone**: Call 1-800-AATD-2nd (Patient Navigator answers)
- **Online**: Submit form (MarkEglyFoundation.org/SecondOpinion—5-10 min)
- **Referral**: Primary doctor, Patient Navigator, or another Foundation program refers patient

**Initial Screening** (Navigator Assesses):

- Clinical scenario (what decision are you facing?)
- Urgency (routine—2 weeks OK, vs. urgent—need answer within days)
- Medical records availability (do you have recent test results? imaging? doctor notes?)
- Insurance (covered? if not, qualify for financial assistance?)

---

### Step 2: Records Gathering & Pre-Review

**Navigator Obtains Records**:

- Patient authorizes release (HIPAA form—Foundation requests records from all providers)
- Navigator collects:
  - **Pulmonary function tests** (FEV1, DLCO, spirometry—past 2 years)
  - **Imaging** (chest CT, liver ultrasound—DICOM files, radiology reports)
  - **Lab results** (AAT level, genotype, liver enzymes, CBC, CMP)
  - **Doctor notes** (visit summaries, consultation reports, hospital discharge summaries)
  - **Medications** (current medication list)
  - **Treatment history** (augmentation therapy start date, infusions log, hospitalizations)

**Pre-Review** (Navigator Summarizes):

- Navigator creates 1-2 page clinical summary (for expert—so expert can review efficiently)
- Includes: Demographics, genotype, key test results, treatment history, current question

**Timeline**: 3-5 days (from request to records gathered)

---

### Step 3: Expert Matching & Scheduling

**Navigator Matches to Expert**:

- Based on clinical scenario:
  - **Lung disease questions** → Pulmonologist (National Jewish, Cleveland Clinic, Mayo)
  - **Liver disease questions** → Hepatologist (UCSF, Mayo, Pittsburgh)
  - **Genetic questions** → Genetic counselor, Medical geneticist
  - **Transplant questions** → Transplant surgeon or transplant pulmonologist
  - **Rare variant** → AATD geneticist, Rare disease specialist

**Scheduling**:

- Navigator contacts expert (directly—bypasses appointment line, Foundation relationship)
- Requests consultation slot (within 7-14 days)
- Expert agrees (Foundation pays consultation fee—see Financial Assistance)

**Patient Notified**:

- Navigator emails patient (consultation scheduled, date/time, expert's name/credentials, format—video, phone, or in-person)

**Timeline**: 2-3 days (from records ready to consultation scheduled)

---

### Step 4: Expert Consultation

**Consultation Formats** (Patient Chooses):

**Option A: Telemedicine (Video Call)**:

- 60-minute video consultation (Zoom, secure HIPAA-compliant)
- Expert reviews records beforehand (comes prepared), discusses with patient
- Patient can bring family member, local doctor (to video call—collaborative)

**Option B: Phone Consultation**:

- 30-60 minute phone call (for patients without reliable internet)

**Option C: In-Person Consultation**:

- Patient travels to expert's clinic (Cleveland Clinic, National Jewish, etc.)
- 60-90 minute in-person visit (physical exam, review imaging together)
- Foundation covers travel costs (if financial need—see Travel Assistance Program)

**Option D: Written Report Only**:

- Expert reviews records (without real-time discussion), writes detailed report
- Faster (no scheduling needed), lower cost ($300 vs. $500-$1,000 for live consult)
- Good for: Straightforward questions (e.g., "Does my FEV1 indicate transplant evaluation?" vs. complex discussions)

---

### Step 5: Expert's Opinion & Report

**Expert Provides**:

- **Diagnosis confirmation** (agree or disagree with first doctor's diagnosis—with rationale)
- **Treatment recommendations** (start augmentation? pursue transplant? adjust medications? enroll in trial?)
- **Alternative options** (if first doctor said "only option is X," expert may suggest Y or Z)
- **Prognosis** (expected disease course, outcomes with/without treatment)
- **Next steps** (what tests/consultations needed, timeline)

**Written Report**:

- Expert dictates or writes detailed report (3-5 pages)
- Sent to patient (within 3-5 days post-consultation)
- Includes: Summary of records reviewed, clinical impression, recommendations, references (peer-reviewed studies supporting recommendations)

---

### Step 6: Navigator Follow-Up & Implementation

**Navigator Helps Implement**:

- Discuss report with patient (explain expert's recommendations, answer questions, address concerns)
- Coordinate with local doctors (send report to patient's pulmonologist, PCP—ensure they're aware of expert's opinion)
- Schedule follow-up tests (if expert recommends CT scan, liver biopsy, etc.—Navigator arranges)
- Facilitate referrals (if expert says "You should see hepatologist," Navigator finds one, schedules appointment)

**Timeline**: Ongoing (Navigator remains involved until recommendations implemented)

## Service Delivery Models

### Model 1: Direct-to-Expert (Standard)

**Process**:

- Foundation arranges consultation (Navigator → Expert)
- Patient pays expert directly (consultation fee $500-$1,500—expert sets rate)
- Foundation subsidizes (reimburses patient $300-$500—see Financial Assistance)

**Pros**:

- Expert compensated fairly (ensures participation, high-quality service)
- Patient pays directly (feels like "their" doctor—not Foundation intermediary)

**Cons**:

- Financial barrier (patient must pay upfront, wait for reimbursement)

---

### Model 2: Foundation-Paid (Premium)

**Process**:

- Foundation pays expert directly (consultation fee—$500-$1,500)
- Patient pays nothing (or small copay—$50-$100)

**Pros**:

- No financial barrier (accessible to all patients—regardless of ability to pay)
- Simpler (patient doesn't handle payments)

**Cons**:

- Higher Foundation cost ($500-$1,500 per consult vs. $300-$500 subsidy)

**When Used**:

- Financial hardship cases (uninsured, low-income—qualify for 100% Foundation coverage)
- Urgent cases (Foundation wants to ensure patient gets opinion—removes barriers)

---

### Model 3: Insurance-Billed (Future—Year 3+)

**Process**:

- Expert bills patient's insurance (as "specialist consultation"—CPT code 99205)
- Insurance covers (minus patient copay—$30-$100)
- Foundation covers copay (if patient qualifies for financial assistance)

**Pros**:

- Sustainable (insurance pays—Foundation only covers copays, not full fee)
- Accessible (patients with insurance don't pay out-of-pocket)

**Cons**:

- Complex (requires in-network agreements, coding, billing—takes time to set up)

**Implementation Timeline**: Year 3 (once program established, negotiate insurance contracts)

---

## Financial Assistance

### Subsidized Consultation Fees

**Standard Subsidy** (All Patients):

- Foundation covers $300 per second opinion consultation
- Patient pays balance (e.g., if expert charges $800, patient pays $500, Foundation pays $300)

**Enhanced Subsidy** (Financial Hardship):

- Income < 200% FPL (~$60K for family of 4) → Foundation covers 100% of consultation fee
- Uninsured → Foundation covers 100%

---

### Travel Assistance (If In-Person Consult)

**Eligible Expenses**:

- Airfare, hotel, meals (if patient travels to expert's clinic)
- Up to $1,500 per consultation (see Medical Travel Assistance Program)

---

### Year 1 Budget: $150K

**Assumptions**:

- 200 second opinions (Year 1 goal)
- Average expert fee: $800
- Foundation pays: $300/consult (standard subsidy) + $500/consult for 50 financial hardship cases
- **Total**: (150 × $300) + (50 × $800) = $45K + $40K = $85K (consultation subsidies)
- **Plus**: Travel assistance ($20K), Navigator staff time ($40K), marketing ($5K)
- **Total Budget**: $150K

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Expert Recruitment (Months 1-3)

**Outreach**:

- Foundation contacts experts (pulmonologists, hepatologists at AATD Centers)
- Pitch: "We're launching second opinion service—will you participate? We'll send you patients, pay consultation fee, streamline process."

**Contracting**:

- Expert agrees to participation (sign MOU—memorandum of understanding)
- Set consultation fee ($500-$1,500—expert determines, Foundation agrees)
- Commitment: See Foundation-referred patients within 2 weeks (expedited access)

**Goal**: Recruit 20 experts (10 pulmonologists, 5 hepatologists, 5 other specialists)

---

### Phase 2: Process Development (Months 4-6)

**Build Systems**:

- Records request protocol (HIPAA forms, how to contact doctors' offices, tracking system)
- Scheduling system (Navigator → Expert coordination—calendar management, reminders)
- Consultation formats (video platform—HIPAA-compliant Zoom, phone scripts, written report templates)
- Payment processing (how Foundation reimburses patients, pays experts)

**Train Staff**:

- Hire 1 dedicated Navigator (Second Opinion Coordinator—$80K/year)
- Train on clinical triage (which expert for which scenario), expert coordination, records gathering

---

### Phase 3: Pilot Launch (Months 7-9)

**Recruit 20 Pilot Patients**:

- Foundation mailing list (identify patients facing major decisions—transplant, starting therapy)
- Offer free second opinion (pilot—Foundation covers 100%, get feedback)

**Test Process**:

- Navigator coordinates (request to consultation—measure timeline, identify bottlenecks)
- Gather feedback (patient satisfaction, expert satisfaction, process improvements)

---

### Phase 4: Public Launch (Month 10)

**Marketing**:

- Announce service (Foundation website, newsletter, social media, press release)
- Target: Patients facing major decisions (transplant evaluation, augmentation therapy decision, uncertain diagnosis)

**Goal**: 200 second opinions (Year 1)

---

### Phase 5: Scale & Optimize (Year 2+)

**Expand Expert Panel** (to 30 experts—Year 2):

- Add rare specialties (transplant surgeons, pediatric experts, rare variant geneticists)

**Reduce Turnaround** (to 7 days—Year 2):

- Streamline records gathering (EHR integration—auto-pull records from patient's Medical Records Portal)
- Standing consultation slots (experts reserve Friday afternoons for Foundation second opinions—no scheduling delays)

**Insurance Billing** (Year 3):

- Negotiate contracts (with major insurers—Aetna, UHC, BCBS)
- Bill insurance (sustainable model—Foundation only covers copays)

---

## Success Metrics

### Track Quarterly
