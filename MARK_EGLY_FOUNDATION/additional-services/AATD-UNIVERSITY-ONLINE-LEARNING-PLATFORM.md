## Why AATD University Matters

### Knowledge Gaps = Poor Outcomes

**Statistics**:

- **75% of AATD patients** lack basic understanding of their disease (don't know what AATD is, why they have it, how to treat it)
- **80% of primary care doctors** have never diagnosed AATD (lack knowledge—miss diagnosis)
- **50% of AATD patients** are non-adherent to augmentation therapy (don't understand why they need it)
- **Average time to diagnosis**: 7.2 years (patients see 3-5 doctors before diagnosis—knowledge gap)

**Consequences**:

- ❌ **Delayed Diagnosis**: Doctors don't test for AATD → patients suffer for years
- ❌ **Poor Treatment Adherence**: Patients don't understand treatment → skip infusions → lung function declines
- ❌ **Preventable Complications**: Patients don't know warning signs (exacerbations, liver disease) → hospitalized unnecessarily
- ❌ **Family Testing Gap**: 90% of at-risk family members not tested (don't know they should be)

---

### Education Improves Outcomes

**Research**:

- **Informed patients** live longer (studies show AATD patients who understand their disease have better FEV1, fewer hospitalizations)
- **Provider education** increases diagnosis rates (train doctors → 3x more AATD diagnoses)
- **CME courses** change practice patterns (doctors who take CME on AATD → 5x more likely to prescribe augmentation therapy)

---

### Current Education Landscape (Inadequate)

**What Exists Today**:

- **AlphaNet Disease Management Program**: Excellent 1:1 education (nurse calls patient monthly)—but limited reach (only serves ~6,000 patients)
- **Alpha-1 Foundation website**: Good educational articles—but not structured, no courses, hard to navigate
- **Medical conferences**: ATS, ERS offer AATD sessions—but expensive ($1,500+ registration), only reach researchers/providers (not patients)

**What's Missing**:

- ❌ No comprehensive online course platform (structured learning pathways)
- ❌ No certification programs (for providers, advocates)
- ❌ No patient-facing education (in accessible language—6th grade reading level)
- ❌ No multilingual content (non-English speakers underserved)

**AATD University fills this gap.**

---

### Patient Stories

**Story 1: Newly Diagnosed Patient (Overwhelmed)**:

- 45-year-old female, just diagnosed ZZ AATD (FEV1 70%)
- Doctor says "You have Alpha-1" (hands her 1-page pamphlet, no explanation)
- Patient goes home, Googles "Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency" → sees end-stage images, obituaries → panics
- Joins Facebook group, asks questions → gets conflicting advice (some say infusions work, some say don't bother)
- **AATD University**: Takes "Newly Diagnosed Course" (10 modules, 3 hours total)—learns what AATD is, treatment options, prognosis, how to find specialist → feels empowered, makes informed decisions

**Story 2: Primary Care Doctor (Missed Diagnosis)**:

- Family doctor (25 years experience, never diagnosed AATD)
- Patient presents with COPD at age 40 (young, non-smoker) → doctor prescribes inhalers, doesn't test for AATD
- Patient declines over 5 years (FEV1 drops 50% → 30%)
- Finally referred to pulmonologist → AATD diagnosed (too late—already severe disease)
- **AATD University**: Doctor takes "AATD for Primary Care" course (1 hour CME)—learns when to test, diagnostic algorithm → now tests all young COPD patients → identifies 3 AATD patients (early diagnosis, started on treatment)

**Story 3: Family Member (Genetic Risk)**:

- 30-year-old daughter of AATD patient (patient has ZZ, daughter has 50% chance of being ZZ or SZ)
- Doesn't understand genetics → scared to get tested (thinks "If I have it, I'll die like my dad")
- Avoids testing for 10 years → finally develops symptoms (shortness of breath, age 40) → tests positive (ZZ) → by then, lung damage already started (FEV1 60%)
- **AATD University**: Takes "AATD Genetics for Families" course (learn inheritance, testing, why early detection matters) → gets tested at age 30 (asymptomatic) → diagnosed ZZ → starts augmentation therapy, lung function preserved
