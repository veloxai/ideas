## Part 2: Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Genetic Testing Partnerships

### 23andMe Partnership Opportunity

**Company Overview:**

- **Founded:** 2006
- **Customers:** 12+ million people have taken 23andMe DNA tests
- **Product:** $99-$229 DNA test (ancestry + health reports)
- **Alpha-1 Status:** 23andMe does NOT currently report Alpha-1 genetic variants in standard health reports (focuses on common conditions like BRCA, Alzheimer's risk variants)
- **Raw Data:** Customers can download raw genetic data, which includes SERPINA1 gene information

**Partnership Vision: "Unlock Alpha-1 Insights for 23andMe Customers"**

**Concept:** 23andMe has already genotyped 12+ million people, including SERPINA1 gene. Customers with Alpha-1 variants don't know because 23andMe doesn't report it. Mark Egly Foundation could partner to:

1. **Add Alpha-1 to 23andMe Health Reports** (requires 23andMe agreement and FDA authorization if marketing as diagnostic)
2. **Carrier Detection Campaign:** Identify 23andMe customers who are Alpha-1 carriers (don't have disease but children could), offer education and family testing
3. **Research Study:** Partner with 23andMe Research on Alpha-1 prevalence, genotype-phenotype correlations using 23andMe's massive dataset

**Partnership Proposal to 23andMe:**

**Option A: Add Alpha-1 to Health Reports**

- **Value for 23andMe:** Differentiate from competitors (AncestryDNA doesn't offer health reports), fulfill mission of making genetic information accessible, potential new revenue (customers pay $70 upgrade for health reports)
- **Value for Mark Egly Foundation:** 12+ million people instantly get Alpha-1 status, dramatic increase in diagnosis, cascade family testing
- **Challenge:** Regulatory hurdles (FDA oversight of health reports), 23andMe prioritizes high-impact or highly requested conditions
- **Timeline:** 2-5 years if pursued (slow regulatory process)

**Option B: Research Partnership**

- **Study Design:** "Alpha-1 Prevalence and Clinical Phenotypes in 23andMe Customers"
- **Population:** 23andMe customers who consent to research (80%+ of customers consent)
- **Data Available:** Genotype (SERPINA1 variants) + self-reported health data (COPD, asthma, liver disease, smoking history)
- **Research Questions:**
  1. What is true prevalence of Alpha-1 in general population? (Current estimates: 1 in 3,500-5,000 in US; actual unknown)
  2. Do individuals with Alpha-1 variants report more respiratory/liver symptoms even if undiagnosed?
  3. What percentage of Alpha-1 carriers/affected individuals are aware of their status? (Hypothesis: <5% awareness)
- **Mark Egly Foundation Role:** Co-PI on study, provide Alpha-1 expertise, recruit participants for clinical validation, provide funding ($50K-$100K for analysis)
- **23andMe Role:** Provide de-identified genotype and phenotype data, institutional review board (IRB) approval, data analysis
- **Publication:** Joint publication in high-impact journal (NEJM, JAMA, Lancet Respiratory Medicine)
- **Impact:** First-ever population-level Alpha-1 prevalence study; demonstrates massive underdiagnosis; strengthens advocacy case for screening

**Option C: Carrier Detection & Family Testing Campaign**

- **Mechanism:** 23andMe identifies customers with one Alpha-1 variant (carriers, estimated 3-5% of population = 360,000-600,000 of 12M customers)
- **Outreach:** 23andMe sends email to carrier customers: "You carry a genetic variant for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency. While you likely don't have the condition, your children could. Learn more about Alpha-1 and free family testing from the Mark Egly Foundation."
- **Mark Egly Foundation Role:** Provide educational content, offer free genetic counseling consults, offer free testing for carrier's family members (identify affected individuals)
- **Value for 23andMe:** Demonstrates utility of genetic testing (identifying carriers prevents disease in next generation), positive PR
- **Value for Mark Egly Foundation:** Reach hundreds of thousands of carriers, identify thousands of undiagnosed affected individuals through family testing
- **Challenge:** 23andMe cautious about customer outreach (doesn't want to alarm customers with too many health alerts), privacy concerns
- **Feasibility:** Medium-to-low in short term, but worth exploring

**Year 1 Action Plan with 23andMe:**

1. **Q1-Q2:** Research 23andMe partnership models, identify decision-makers (Chief Medical Officer, Head of Research, Business Development)
2. **Q2-Q3:** Outreach and introductory meetings, pitch research partnership as most feasible near-term collaboration
3. **Q3-Q4:** If interest, develop research proposal, submit for 23andMe review
4. **Year 2:** Execute research study if approved

## Part 3: Newborn Screening Advocacy

### Current State of Alpha-1 Newborn Screening

**Background:**

- **Newborn Screening Programs:** Every US state screens newborns for 30-50 genetic/metabolic conditions (varies by state)
- **Alpha-1 Status:** Alpha-1 is NOT included in Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) by federal government
- **Pilot Programs:** Some states (Texas) piloted Alpha-1 newborn screening in past, discontinued due to controversy

**Controversy:**

- **Pro-Screening Arguments:**
  1. Early identification enables prevention (avoid smoking, occupational exposures)
  2. Family cascade testing (identify affected parents/siblings)
  3. Newborn screening proven effective for other genetic conditions
- **Anti-Screening Arguments:**
  1. Most Alpha-1 individuals remain healthy (20-30% never develop significant symptoms)
  2. No treatment available for newborns/children (augmentation therapy only for adults with lung disease)
  3. Potential for genetic discrimination (life insurance, employment)
  4. Psychological burden on parents (child labeled with genetic condition)
  5. Cost-effectiveness unclear

**Current Medical Consensus (2025):**

- American Thoracic Society, American College of Medical Genetics: Alpha-1 newborn screening NOT recommended as universal screening, but reasonable to offer in targeted circumstances (family history, symptomatic siblings)

**Mark Egly Foundation Position:**

- **Short-Term (Year 1-3):** Do NOT actively advocate for universal newborn screening (too controversial, divides community, low likelihood of success)
- **Medium-Term (Year 4-7):** Monitor evolving evidence, participate in stakeholder discussions
- **Long-Term (Year 8+):** If new treatments emerge for children or prevention strategies proven highly effective, reconsider advocacy position

**Instead, Advocate For:**

- **Family-Based Screening:** When child diagnosed with Alpha-1, ensure parents and siblings are tested (cascade screening)
- **Adolescent/Young Adult Screening:** Age 16-25 screening for high-risk individuals (family history, respiratory symptoms) when lifestyle choices become relevant
- **Inclusion in Carrier Screening Panels:** Alpha-1 included in reproductive carrier screening (couples planning pregnancy can learn carrier status, make informed decisions)

---

### Reproductive Carrier Screening Partnership

**Opportunity:** Many couples undergo genetic carrier screening when planning pregnancy (tests whether parents carry genes for conditions like cystic fibrosis, sickle cell, Tay-Sachs)

**Current State:**

- **Expanded Carrier Screening Panels:** Test for 100-400 genetic conditions in one panel
- **Alpha-1 Inclusion:** Some panels include Alpha-1, others don't (inconsistent)
- **Cost:** $200-$400 per person, often covered by insurance

**Advocacy Goal:** Advocate for Alpha-1 inclusion in all expanded carrier screening panels

**Partnership Targets:**

- **Testing Companies:** Counsyl/Myriad Women's Health, Invitae, Sema4, Natera - work with to ensure Alpha-1 included
- **Professional Societies:** ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists), ACMG (American College of Medical Genetics) - advocate for Alpha-1 inclusion in carrier screening guidelines
- **Insurance Companies:** Advocate for coverage of carrier screening including Alpha-1

**Mark Egly Foundation Role:**

- Provide educational materials for OB/GYNs about Alpha-1 and importance of carrier screening
- Offer genetic counseling support for couples with Alpha-1 carrier results
- Advocate to professional societies and policy-makers

**Year 1 Action:** Research current carrier screening landscape, begin conversations with testing companies and professional societies

---

## Part 4: Point-of-Care Testing Development

### Current Testing Limitations

**Standard Alpha-1 Testing:**

- **Blood Draw or Buccal Swab:** Collected in clinic or at home
- **Send to Reference Lab:** Shipped to laboratory for analysis
- **Turnaround Time:** 2-4 weeks
- **Barrier:** Delay between test order and result discourages some physicians from testing, patients may not follow up

**Vision: Rapid Point-of-Care Testing**

- **Sample:** Finger-stick blood drop (like glucose meter)
- **Location:** Physician's office, pharmacy, health fair
- **Turnaround:** 15-30 minutes (patient waits for result)
- **Benefits:** Immediate diagnosis, higher testing uptake, no follow-up needed

**Technology Status:**

- **No FDA-Approved POC Test Yet:** Rapid Alpha-1 testing doesn't exist as of 2025
- **Development Stage:** Academic researchers and small biotech companies exploring POC platforms (lateral flow assay, microfluidics)
- **Timeline:** 5-10 years to FDA approval if developed

---

### Mark Egly Foundation Role in POC Test Development

**Strategy: Early-Stage Support for Promising Technologies**

**Model:**

1. **Monitor Field:** Track publications, conference presentations on POC Alpha-1 testing development
2. **Identify Promising Teams:** Academic labs or startups with POC test prototypes
3. **Provide Pilot Funding:** Small grants ($25K-$50K) to support proof-of-concept studies, clinical validation
4. **Connect to Resources:** Introduce developers to Alpha-1 patient community for user testing, connect to potential commercial partners
5. **Advocate for Adoption:** Once FDA-approved, promote to providers, advocate for insurance coverage

**Inspiration:**

- CF Foundation funded development of Vertex's Trikafta (venture philanthropy model)
- Mark Egly Foundation too small for full drug development, but POC test development more modest ($1-5M total development cost vs. $100M-$1B for drug)

**Year 1 Action:**

- Research current POC test development efforts
- Identify 1-2 promising teams
- Attend conferences (American Thoracic Society, AACC - clinical chemistry) to network with developers

**Year 2-3 Action:**

- Provide pilot funding to 1 promising team ($25K-$50K)
- Facilitate clinical validation studies (recruit Alpha-1 patients for testing)

**Year 5-10 Vision:**

- POC test FDA-approved, Mark Egly Foundation credited as early supporter
- Diagnostic delay reduced to <1 year due to rapid, accessible testing

---

## Part 5: Data Sharing & Research Collaboration

### Genetic Variant Database

**Opportunity:** Alpha-1 caused by >100 SERPINA1 variants; some well-characterized (S, Z alleles), others rare and poorly understood

**Challenge:** Variant data scattered across testing companies, research institutions, clinical labs; no centralized database

**Vision:** Mark Egly Foundation partners with testing companies to aggregate variant data

**Partnership Model:**

- **Testing Companies Provide:** De-identified variant data from Alpha-1 tests performed (variant type, patient demographics, clinical phenotype if available)
- **Mark Egly Foundation Provides:** Centralized database, data analysis, publication of findings
- **Academic Partners:** Collaborate with Alpha-1 researchers (MUSC, UF, OHSU) to interpret variants

**Database Contents:**

- **Genetic Variants:** All SERPINA1 variants identified in testing
- **Allele Frequencies:** How common is each variant in tested population
- **Clinical Phenotypes:** Do individuals with specific variants develop lung disease, liver disease, both, or neither? (requires patient follow-up)
- **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations:** Predict disease severity based on genetic variant

**Impact:**

- **Clinical Utility:** Help physicians predict prognosis for patients with rare variants
- **Research Utility:** Prioritize variants for functional studies, drug development
- **Patient Utility:** Patients with rare variants get better information about what to expect

**Year 1 Action:**

- Explore feasibility with testing company partners
- Consult with Alpha-1 researchers about database design
- Investigate existing databases (NCBI ClinVar, Alpha-1 Foundation registry) for potential collaboration

**Year 2-3 Action:**

- If feasible, establish data sharing agreements with 1-2 testing companies
- Pilot database with 500-1,000 variant records
- Publish initial findings

## Part 8: Ethical Considerations & Privacy

### Informed Consent Requirements

**All Genetic Testing Requires Patient Consent:**

- **Purpose of Testing:** Detect SERPINA1 genetic variants causing Alpha-1
- **Test Limitations:** May not detect all rare variants, no test is 100% accurate
- **Results:** Possible outcomes (normal, carrier, affected), implications for patient and family
- **Data Use:** How data will be used by Mark Egly Foundation and testing company (clinical care, research, aggregate reporting)
- **Privacy:** HIPAA protections, de-identification for research
- **Right to Refuse:** Voluntary participation, can decline or withdraw
- **Genetic Counseling:** Available for result interpretation

**Special Considerations:**

- **Minors:** Parental consent required for testing individuals under 18
- **Incidental Findings:** Testing may reveal non-paternity (child's genetic results don't match presumed father) - rare but possible
- **Genetic Discrimination:** Federal law (GINA) prohibits genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment, but does NOT cover life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance

---

### Privacy & Data Security

**HIPAA Compliance:**

- Mark Egly Foundation is "covered entity" if providing healthcare services (genetic counseling), requires HIPAA compliance
- Testing company is "business associate," requires business associate agreement (BAA)
- Patient data encrypted during transmission and storage
- Access controls (only authorized personnel view patient data)

**De-Identification for Research:**

- Remove 18 HIPAA identifiers (name, address, dates, medical record numbers, etc.)
- Data cannot be re-identified by Mark Egly Foundation or researchers
- IRB (Institutional Review Board) approval for research studies

**Data Retention:**

- Patient records retained per legal requirements (typically 7 years)
- Research data retained indefinitely (de-identified)
