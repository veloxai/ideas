## Executive Summary

Pharmaceutical companies manufacturing Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) therapies are natural strategic partners for the Mark Egly Foundation. These companies have vested commercial interest in earlier diagnosis, patient support, provider education, and research advancing the field. However, pharmaceutical partnerships require careful ethical management to maintain Foundation independence, credibility, and patient trust.

**Core Partnership Companies:**

1. **Grifols** (Prolastin-C) - Estimated $500M+ annual AATD revenue, largest player
2. **CSL Behring** (Zemaira) - Major competitor, strong research portfolio
3. **Takeda** (Glassia) - Third manufacturer, part of larger rare disease portfolio

**Partnership Value Proposition:**

- **For Pharma:** Earlier diagnosis = more patients identified = larger market; patient education = better adherence; research = pipeline advancement; community goodwill = brand reputation
- **For Mark Egly Foundation:** Funding for programs ($200K-$500K annually by Year 3); research collaboration; patient assistance referrals; employee engagement; industry expertise access

**Critical Ethical Principles:**

1. **Independence:** All funding UNRESTRICTED - pharma has zero control over Foundation priorities, messaging, or grant decisions
2. **Transparency:** Full disclosure of pharma funding sources in annual reports, website, grant materials
3. **No Product Endorsement:** Foundation NEVER recommends specific products or companies
4. **Patient First:** All partnerships must advance patient interests, not commercial interests
5. **Conflict of Interest Management:** Robust policies preventing pharma influence over Foundation governance or research

**Partnership Framework:**

- **Tier 1 - Strategic Partners:** One or more pharma companies with comprehensive multi-year partnerships (research co-funding, educational grants, employee giving, event sponsorship) - Target $100K-$250K annually per partner by Year 2-3
- **Tier 2 - Program Partners:** Transactional relationships for specific programs (one educational grant, one event sponsorship) - Target $25K-$75K annually
- **Tier 3 - Engagement Partners:** Early-stage relationships (patient referrals, conference participation, exploratory conversations) - No funding yet

---

### 4. Employee Giving Campaigns

**Workplace Giving Program at Pharma Companies ($10K-$50K per company annually by Year 2-3)**

**Why Pharma Employees Will Give:**

- **Mission Alignment:** Pharma employees chose careers to help patients; Mark Egly Foundation directly serves patients their company's products help
- **Employer Match:** Many pharma companies offer generous matching (1:1 or 2:1), doubling employee impact
- **Community Connection:** Employees see tangible impact of their work through patient stories
- **Industry Knowledge:** Employees understand Alpha-1, making case for support easier

**Campaign Model (see Employee Giving Programs document for details):**

- **Annual Campaign:** 2-4 week campaign in fall or spring
- **Kickoff Event:** Mark Egly or patient speaker presents at company (virtual or in-person), shares Foundation's mission and impact
- **Payroll Deduction:** Easy recurring giving option
- **Employee Matching:** Company matches employee donations 1:1 or 2:1
- **Campaign Goal:** $10,000 raised (50 employees giving $200 average, with match)

**Mark Egly Foundation Support:**

- Speaker (Mark Egly, patient, Foundation staff) for kickoff and events
- Impact updates throughout campaign
- Thank you event or recognition

**Year 1 Goal:** Launch 1 pilot employee giving campaign at Grifols, CSL Behring, or Takeda facility (target $10K-$25K with match)

---

### 5. Patient Assistance Program Coordination

**Referral Network:**

- **Pharma Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs):** All three companies operate PAPs providing free or reduced-cost medication to uninsured/underinsured patients
- **Mark Egly Foundation Patient Assistance Program:** Provides financial assistance for co-pays, travel, genetic testing, DME - complements pharma PAPs

**Partnership Model:**

- **Pharma refers to Mark Egly Foundation:** When patient qualifies for free drug through pharma PAP but still faces financial barriers (travel to infusion center, co-pays for other medications, genetic testing for family members, pulmonary rehab costs), pharma patient services staff refers to Mark Egly Foundation
- **Mark Egly Foundation refers to Pharma:** When patient applies to Mark Egly Foundation for augmentation therapy co-pay assistance, Mark Egly Foundation first directs to pharma PAPs (potentially free medication), then provides co-pay assistance for gaps

**Data Sharing:**

- Aggregate data only (e.g., "Mark Egly Foundation assisted 50 patients referred by Grifols in Year 1")
- Individual patient data remains confidential (HIPAA compliance)
- Demonstrates partnership value to both organizations

**Year 1 Goal:** Establish referral protocols with patient services teams at all 3 companies, track referrals (expect 20-50 patients referred to Mark Egly Foundation)

---

### 6. Clinical Trial Support

**Mark Egly Foundation Role in Clinical Trials:**

- **Trial Awareness:** Alert Alpha-1 community to new clinical trials recruiting (via newsletter, website, social media)
- **Patient Recruitment Support:** Connect researchers conducting trials with patient community (with patient permission)
- **Trial Participation Assistance:** Provide travel assistance for patients participating in trials (especially trials at distant academic centers)

**Pharma Collaboration:**

- **Trial Listings:** Pharma shares information about company-sponsored trials for Mark Egly Foundation to promote (increases recruitment)
- **Patient Advisory:** Mark Egly Foundation provides patient input on trial design (via Patient Advisory Council) to make trials more patient-friendly
- **Recruitment:** Pharma sponsors Mark Egly Foundation trial awareness campaign (unrestricted educational grant supporting trial education broadly, not specific trial recruitment)

**Ethical Boundaries:**

- Mark Egly Foundation does NOT receive per-patient recruitment fees (common in clinical research, but creates conflict of interest for patient organization)
- Mark Egly Foundation promotes ALL Alpha-1 trials, not just pharma sponsor's trials
- Trial participation assistance available regardless of trial sponsor
- Patients make independent decisions about trial participation (Mark Egly Foundation educates, does not recruit)

**Year 1 Goal:** Establish clinical trial collaboration framework, promote 2-3 Alpha-1 trials on website/newsletter (may or may not be pharma partner trials)

---

## Part 3: Conflict of Interest Management

### Safeguards Protecting Foundation Independence

**1. Governance Safeguards:**

- **Board Independence:** Pharmaceutical company employees NOT eligible to serve on Mark Egly Foundation Board of Directors
- **SAC Recusal:** If pharmaceutical employee or consultant serves on Scientific Advisory Committee, they recuse from reviewing any grant with potential conflict (grants related to their company's product or competitor products)
- **Donor Bill of Rights:** Mark Egly Foundation adopts Donor Bill of Rights affirming that no donor controls Foundation activities

**2. Funding Safeguards:**

- **Unrestricted Funding Only:** All pharmaceutical funding is unrestricted (no earmarking, no control over use)
- **Diversified Funding:** Pharmaceutical funding capped at 40% of total revenue (prevents over-reliance on one funding source)
- **Multi-Company Engagement:** Partner with all 3 manufacturers (Grifols, CSL Behring, Takeda) to avoid perception of favoritism
- **Transparency:** Full disclosure of pharmaceutical funding in annual report (company name, dollar amount, purpose)

**3. Communication Safeguards:**

- **No Product Endorsement:** Mark Egly Foundation NEVER recommends specific augmentation therapy products or companies
- **Neutral Language:** Educational materials discuss "augmentation therapy" generically, not specific branded products
- **Product Information:** If patients ask about differences between products, Mark Egly Foundation directs to physician and provides objective comparison chart (formulation, dosing, home vs. clinic infusion options) without recommendations
- **Disclaimer:** All materials funded by pharma include disclaimer: "This program is supported by an unrestricted educational grant from [Company]. The content is developed independently by the Mark Egly Foundation. [Company] had no control over content or messaging."

**4. Research Safeguards:**

- **Independent Peer Review:** All grants funded by Mark Egly Foundation (including co-funded grants) undergo independent peer review; pharma companies do not review or score applications
- **Publication Freedom:** Researchers maintain right to publish findings regardless of outcome; pharma co-funders have no publication approval rights
- **Data Ownership:** Researchers own data; data shared with pharma co-funders only via public publications or separate data sharing agreements negotiated by researcher
- **Intellectual Property:** Standard policy (institution owns, Mark Egly Foundation gets non-exclusive license); pharma co-funders have no IP rights beyond standard

**5. Annual COI Review:**

- **Disclosure:** All Board members, staff, and SAC members annually disclose pharmaceutical industry relationships (employment, consulting, stock ownership, research funding)
- **Assessment:** Board reviews disclosures and determines if any conflicts require management (recusal, resignation, portfolio adjustment)
- **Policy Updates:** COI policy reviewed annually and updated as needed

---

### Addressing Stakeholder Concerns

**Patient Community Concerns:**

- **Concern:** "Is Mark Egly Foundation just a front for drug companies?"
- **Response:** "Mark Egly Foundation is an independent 501(c)(3) organization. While we accept unrestricted educational grants from pharmaceutical companies (a standard practice in health nonprofits), these companies have zero control over our programs, research priorities, or messaging. We partner with all three Alpha-1 therapy manufacturers to avoid favoritism, and pharmaceutical funding is capped at 40% of our budget. We fully disclose all pharmaceutical support in our annual report. Our loyalty is to patients, not companies."

**Researcher Concerns:**

- **Concern:** "Will pharmaceutical involvement bias Mark Egly Foundation's grant decisions?"
- **Response:** "All grants undergo independent peer review by our Scientific Advisory Committee. Pharmaceutical companies do not review, score, or influence grant decisions. For co-funded grants, Mark Egly Foundation's peer review process approves the project first; pharmaceutical co-funding is provided as unrestricted support after independent approval. Publication rights remain with researchers, and pharmaceutical co-funders have no approval rights."

**Advocate/Blogger Concerns:**

- **Concern:** "Mark Egly Foundation is partnering with pharma - are they just trying to sell more drugs?"
- **Response:** "Mark Egly Foundation's mission is reducing diagnostic delays, not increasing drug sales. The majority of our work focuses on earlier diagnosis, which benefits all Alpha-1 patients regardless of treatment choices. We partner with pharmaceutical companies on areas of shared interest - patient education, research, disease awareness - but we never endorse specific products. Pharmaceutical companies benefit from earlier diagnosis (more patients identified), and patients benefit from earlier intervention. It's possible for both to be true."

**Media Inquiries:**

- **Statement:** "The Mark Egly Foundation accepts unrestricted educational grants and sponsorships from pharmaceutical companies manufacturing Alpha-1 therapies, consistent with standard nonprofit practice. All pharmaceutical support is fully disclosed in our annual report and on our website. These companies have no control over Foundation programs, research priorities, or messaging. We partner with multiple companies to ensure independence. Our mission is serving Alpha-1 patients, and we welcome support from all stakeholders committed to that goal."
