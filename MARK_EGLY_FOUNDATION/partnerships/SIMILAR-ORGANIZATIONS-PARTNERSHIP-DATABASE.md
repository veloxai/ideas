3. **Learn Best Practices:** Benchmark against successful disease foundations
4. **Build Coalition Power:** Join rare disease and respiratory health alliances for stronger advocacy
5. **Share Resources:** Exchange data, educational materials, and operational expertise

**Partnership Tiers:**

- **Tier 1 - Strategic Partners:** Deep collaboration, shared governance, joint programs (Alpha-1 Foundation, COPD Foundation)
- **Tier 2 - Active Collaborators:** Regular coordination, joint projects, resource sharing (CF Foundation, Michael J. Fox Foundation as models)
- **Tier 3 - Coalition Members:** Membership in advocacy coalitions (NORD, EveryLife Foundation, Genetic Alliance)
- **Tier 4 - Benchmarking Organizations:** Learn from but no formal partnership (various disease foundations)

- **Rapid Growth:** Grew from startup to $150M+ annual budget in ~20 years
- **Research Impact:** Funded $2B+ in research, accelerated clinical trials, funded biomarker development
- **Patient Engagement:** Strong patient involvement in research priority setting

**Key Learnings for Mark Egly Foundation:**

1. **Celebrity Founder Leverage:**
   - Michael J. Fox used fame to attract major donors, media attention, corporate sponsors
   - **Mark Egly Application:** Leverage Mark's PGA connections for celebrity golf events, corporate partnerships (golf industry sponsors), media opportunities through sports networks
   - **Differentiation:** Mark Egly's platform smaller than Hollywood star, but unique angle as PGA pro + Alpha-1 patient resonates with sports/golf industry

2. **Bold Research Strategy:**
   - Michael J. Fox Foundation funded high-risk/high-reward research traditional funders avoided
   - Prioritized research directly impacting patients (biomarkers, clinical trial optimization) over basic science
   - **Mark Egly Application:** Fund research reducing diagnostic delays (Mark Egly Foundation's core mission) - diagnostic tools, screening algorithms, provider education interventions - areas underfunded by NIH

3. **Patient-Driven Approach:**
   - Patients participate in research priority setting through Patient Council
   - Research grants required patient-oriented outcomes and timelines
   - **Mark Egly Application:** Alpha-1 Patient Advisory Council reviews all grant applications, ensures research addresses patient priorities (faster diagnosis, better treatments, improved quality of life)

4. **Team Science Model:**
   - Funded multi-institution consortia rather than individual labs for faster progress
   - Created data sharing mandates for all grantees
   - **Mark Egly Application:** Multi-site natural history studies, coordinated biomarker research, mandatory data deposition in repositories (faster knowledge accumulation in small field)

5. **Corporate Partnerships:**
   - Extensive pharma partnerships (co-funding research, data sharing, clinical trial support)
   - **Mark Egly Application:** Partner with Grifols, CSL Behring, Takeda (AATD therapy manufacturers) on research, patient programs, employee giving campaigns

**Specific Tactics to Adopt:**

- **Annual Patients as Partners Conference:** Michael J. Fox Foundation brings together researchers and patients; Mark Egly Foundation could host annual "Alpha-1 Research Summit" (Year 2-3, once research program mature)
- **Progress Reports to Patients:** Simple summaries of research findings in patient language - Mark Egly Foundation does this for all grants funded
- **Clinical Trial Matching:** Michael J. Fox Foundation's trial matching tool connects patients to studies; Mark Egly Foundation could create simple "Find an Alpha-1 Clinical Trial" tool (Year 2-3)
- **Bold Fundraising Goals:** Michael J. Fox Foundation set aggressive public fundraising goals ("$50 million for Parkinson's research"); Mark Egly Foundation should be bold ("$5M in 5 Years for Alpha-1 Research")

---

### Cystic Fibrosis Foundation

**Why Benchmark:**

- **Rare Disease Success Story:** CF Foundation funded research leading to breakthrough therapies (Vertex's Trikafta)
- **Venture Philanthropy Model:** Took equity stakes in drug development, earned $3.3B when Trikafta succeeded (now funding more research)
- **Patient Registry:** 30+ year patient registry is gold standard for rare disease natural history data
- **Patient Services:** Extensive patient assistance programs (compassionate care fund)

**Key Learnings for Mark Egly Foundation:**

1. **Patient Registry as Foundation:**
   - CF Foundation's registry enabled every major research advance (natural history, clinical trial design, outcome measures)
   - **Mark Egly Application:** Work with Alpha-1 Foundation (which has established registry) rather than create competing registry; Mark Egly Foundation grantees access registry for recruitment; contribute funding to registry expansion/enhancement

2. **Drug Development Funding:**
   - CF Foundation funded early-stage drug development pharma wouldn't touch (too risky, small market)
   - **Mark Egly Application:** Mark Egly Foundation too small initially for drug funding, but could fund pilot studies of repurposed drugs, biomarker development enabling future trials, natural history studies reducing trial costs (Year 3+, $100K-$200K drug development grants)

3. **Patient Assistance at Scale:**
   - CF Foundation's Compass program helps patients navigate insurance, financial assistance, care coordination
   - **Mark Egly Application:** Mark Egly Foundation's Patient Assistance Program provides direct financial aid; consider adding care navigation component (Year 2-3, hire patient navigator to help patients access resources beyond just financial)

4. **Quality Improvement Initiatives:**
   - CF Foundation's care center network drives quality improvement (benchmarking, best practices)
   - **Mark Egly Application:** Mark Egly Foundation could fund Alpha-1 clinic quality improvement projects (e.g., reducing diagnostic delays in clinic's catchment area, improving genetic counseling practices) (Year 2-3)

**Specific Tactics to Adopt:**

- **Compassionate Care Fund:** CF Foundation provides emergency financial assistance to families in crisis; Mark Egly Foundation's Patient Assistance Program includes emergency assistance category (up to $50K annually) - already planned
- **Pipeline Report:** CF Foundation publishes annual "Drug Development Pipeline" showing all CF therapies in development; Mark Egly Foundation could publish annual "Alpha-1 Research Landscape" (Year 2+, summarizes all Alpha-1 research worldwide, not just Mark Egly Foundation funded)
- **Investor Mentality:** CF Foundation thinks like venture capitalist, funding high-risk projects with big potential; Mark Egly Foundation should dedicate portion of research budget to "moonshot" projects (20% of grants are Rapid Response high-risk/high-reward - already planned)

---

### ALS Association

**Key Learnings:**

1. **Viral Fundraising:**
   - Ice Bucket Challenge succeeded due to: simple action (dump ice water), social media share mechanism, celebrity participation, summer timing
   - **Mark Egly Application:** Create "Breathe Easy Challenge" (film yourself taking deep breath, share, challenge 3 friends to donate or do challenge) tied to Rare Disease Day or COPD Awareness Month; leverage Mark Egly's PGA connections to get professional golfers to participate (social proof)

2. **Research Capitalization:**
   - ALS Association rapidly deployed Ice Bucket windfall to research ($89M in 4 years), leading to new therapies
   - **Mark Egly Application:** Have "research ready" pipeline - if Mark Egly Foundation has sudden fundraising success, immediately deploy to high-impact research (pre-identified priority projects that could scale with more funding)

**Specific Tactics to Adopt:**

- **Equipment Loan Program:** ALS Association loans medical equipment to patients; Alpha-1 patients need nebulizers, oxygen concentrators, CPAP/BiPAP machines - Mark Egly Foundation could establish small equipment loan closet (Year 2-3, $20K-$30K startup)
- **Walk to Defeat ALS:** ALS Association's annual walk raises $30M+ nationally; Mark Egly Foundation's "Breathe Easy 5K Walk/Run" follows similar model (Year 1, $75K-$200K projected)

- **Telethon Fundraising:** Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon (1966-2010) raised $2.6B over 44 years through annual TV event
- **Summer Camp:** MDA Summer Camp provides week-long camp for kids with muscular dystrophy (builds community, gives families respite)

**Key Learnings:**

- **Long-term Thinking:** MDA's 70-year track record shows patience - rare disease research takes decades, foundation must plan for long haul
- **Family-Centered:** MDA summer camps support whole family (kids get experience, parents get respite)
  - **Mark Egly Application:** Mark Egly Foundation could host "Alpha-1 Family Weekend" (Year 2-3) bringing families together for education, support, activities (similar concept, less intensive than week-long camp)
