## Major Donor Program Overview

### Definition of Major Donor

**Mark Egly Foundation Major Donor Levels**:

**Leadership Circle**: $100,000+ (annual or cumulative)
**Visionary Circle**: $50,000 - $99,999
**Champions Circle**: $25,000 - $49,999
**Innovators Circle**: $10,000 - $24,999

**Year 1 Focus**: Innovators Circle ($10K+)

---

### Why Major Donors Matter

**80/20 Rule in Fundraising**:

- 80% of donations come from 20% of donors
- Major donors = Largest revenue source (sustainable, scalable)
- 10 donors × $10K = $100K (vs. 1,000 donors × $100 = $100K)

**Major Donors Provide**:

- ✅ Significant revenue (multi-year gifts, planned giving)
- ✅ Strategic advice (board service, expertise, connections)
- ✅ Credibility (early major donors attract other donors)
- ✅ Advocacy (ambassadors, influencers, door-openers)

---

- 5 = Net worth $10M+ (can easily give $100K+)
- 4 = Net worth $5-10M (can give $50K+)
- 3 = Net worth $1-5M (can give $10-25K)
- 2 = Net worth $500K-$1M (can give $5-10K)
- 1 = Net worth <$500K (minor donor potential)

**Affinity** (1-5):

- 5 = AATD patient or immediate family (deeply personal)
- 4 = Close friend/family of AATD patient (personal connection)
- 3 = Physician treating AATD, or pharmaceutical executive (professional interest)
- 2 = Rare disease donor, healthcare philanthropist (general interest)
- 1 = No clear AATD connection (need to build affinity)

**Readiness** (1-5):

- 5 = Already expressed interest in giving ("How can I help?")
- 4 = Active philanthropist (gives to other causes, likely receptive)
- 3 = Philanthropic (board service, prior giving), but not yet engaged with Foundation

---

## Cultivation Strategy

### The Cultivation Cycle

**Cultivation** = Building relationship before asking for gift

**Timeline**: 6-18 months (Tier 1 prospects: 6 months; Tier 2-3: 12-18 months)

**Goal**: Prospect knows, likes, and trusts Foundation (ready to say "yes" when asked)

---

### Cultivation Moves

**"Move"** = Meaningful interaction with prospect (move them closer to gift)

**Target**: 5-10 moves before solicitation (Tier 1 prospects)

**Types of Moves**:

**1. Introduction** (First Move):

- Board member or Mark makes warm introduction
- Method: Email introduction, phone call, or coffee meeting
- Message: "I thought you'd be interested in learning about Mark Egly Foundation. Mark is passionate about ending AATD diagnostic delays. Can we set up a brief call?"

**2. Discovery Meeting** (Second Move):

- 30-60 minute meeting (in-person or Zoom)
- Goal: Learn about prospect (interests, values, capacity, readiness)
- Mark or CDO presents Foundation (mission, impact, plans)
- **Not an ask** (just building relationship)

**3. Site Visit / Program Experience**:

- Invite prospect to see Foundation's work firsthand
- Options:
  - Attend support group meeting (meet AATD patients)
  - Tour research lab (if funding research)
  - Join Advocacy Day (Capitol Hill visits)
- Goal: Emotional connection (see impact)

**4. Exclusive Events**:

- Small, intimate gatherings (10-20 prospects)
- Speaker: Mark, patient speaker, medical expert
- Setting: Private home (board member's house), upscale restaurant, golf club
- Format: Dinner + presentation (30 min presentation, 30 min Q&A)
- Goal: Peer influence (prospects see other high-net-worth individuals engaged)

**5. Personalized Materials**:

- Send materials tailored to prospect's interests:
  - Research proposal (if interested in innovation)
  - Patient impact story (if motivated by gratitude)
  - Financial statements (if wants to see fiscal responsibility)
- Handwritten note from Mark (personal touch)

**6. Board Member Connection**:

- Board member reaches out (peer-to-peer)
- Message: "I joined the board because I believe in Mark's vision. Would love to tell you why I'm involved."
- Goal: Credibility (if board member giving time + money, signals Foundation is legit)

**7. Expert Briefing**:

- Invite prospect to private briefing with AATD expert
- Speaker: Leading pulmonologist, geneticist, or patient advocate
- Topic: "State of AATD Research" or "Diagnostic Delay Crisis"
- Goal: Educate + inspire (show cutting-edge work)

**8. Recognition Opportunity**:

- Discuss naming opportunity (if prospect interested in legacy)
- Examples:
  - "The Smith Family AATD Research Fund" ($100K+)
  - "Jones Innovation Award" ($50K+)
  - "Brown Patient Assistance Fund" ($25K+)
- Goal: Show how gift creates lasting legacy

### Cultivation Best Practices

**Do**:

- ✅ **Listen more than talk** (discovery: learn about prospect's interests, motivations)
- ✅ **Personalize** (tailor cultivation to each prospect—one-size-fits-all doesn't work)
- ✅ **Build relationship** (don't rush—cultivation takes time)
- ✅ **Involve volunteers** (board members, patients—peer influence is powerful)
- ✅ **Track moves** (document each interaction in donor database)

**Don't**:

- ❌ **Ask too soon** (need 5-10 moves first—build trust)
- ❌ **Be transactional** (relationship-based, not transaction-based)
- ❌ **Forget** (stay in touch—monthly email, quarterly call, annual event)
- ❌ **Over-ask** (one ask per year for major donor—not constant appeals)

---

## Solicitation Best Practices

### When to Ask

**Signals Prospect is Ready**:

- ✅ Asks detailed questions (budget, programs, outcomes—shows serious interest)
- ✅ Introduces you to others ("You should meet my friend who's a pulmonologist")
- ✅ Attends multiple events (engaged, not one-time curiosity)
- ✅ Says "How can I help?" or "What do you need?" (invitation to ask)

**If Not Sure**: Ask board member or trusted advisor ("Do you think [Prospect] is ready?")

---

### The Ask Meeting

**Pre-Meeting Prep**:

1. **Determine ask amount**:
   - Based on capacity, prior giving, peer gifts
   - Specific amount (not "Whatever you're comfortable with"—too vague)
   - Example: $25,000 (over 3 years = $8,333/year) OR $10,000 (one-time)

2. **Determine ask purpose**:
   - General operating support OR specific project (research grant, patient assistance fund, advocacy campaign)
   - Align with prospect's interests (if passionate about research → research project)

3. **Team**:
   - 2-person team (Mark + board member, or CDO + board member)
   - Roles: One person makes ask, other provides support/answers questions

4. **Practice**:
   - Rehearse ask (know your talking points, amount, timing)
   - Anticipate objections ("I need to think about it," "That's more than I can give," etc.)

---

**Ask Meeting Structure** (60-90 minutes):

**1. Warm-Up** (10 min):

- Thank prospect for their time + interest
- Catch up (personal connection—family, work, golf, etc.)

**2. Foundation Update** (15 min):

- Recent accomplishments (grants awarded, patients served, advocacy wins)
- Upcoming priorities (next 12 months)
- Financial health (budget, revenue sources, fiscal responsibility)

**3. The Case for Support** (15 min):

- Why now? (urgency—700K undiagnosed, 7-8 year delay is unacceptable)
- Why this project? (if project-specific—e.g., "We need $250K to launch patient assistance program")
- Why you? (why is this prospect the right person to fund this?)

**4. The Ask** (5 min):

- **Clear, direct ask**: "[Prospect Name], we're hoping you'll consider a gift of $[Amount] to support [Purpose]."
- **Pause**: STOP TALKING (silence is okay—let prospect process)
- Wait for response (don't fill silence with nervous talking)

**5. Response + Negotiation** (20 min):

- **If YES**: Celebrate! Discuss next steps (payment schedule, recognition, stewardship)
- **If "I need to think about it"**: That's okay. When can we follow up? (specific date—"May I call you in 2 weeks?")
- **If "That's more than I can give"**: What amount would be comfortable? (negotiate down—but don't go below $10K for major donor ask)
- **If NO**: Thank them for considering. Ask: "Is there another way you'd like to be involved?" (board service, advocacy, smaller gift, in-kind donation)

**6. Next Steps** (5 min):

- Confirm next steps (payment method, timing, recognition preferences)
- Thank you (again—gratitude is key)

---

### Solicitation Don'ts

**Don't**:

- ❌ **Apologize for asking** ("I hate to ask, but..." → Signals lack of confidence)
- ❌ **Justify the amount** ("We need $25K because..." → States amount, doesn't defend it)
- ❌ **Give options** ("Would you consider $25K, or $10K, or...?" → Confusing, seems desperate)
- ❌ **Negotiate with yourself** ("$25K is a lot, so maybe $10K?" → Wait for prospect to negotiate)
- ❌ **Rush** (If prospect says "I need to think about it," don't pressure—give them time)

---

## Stewardship & Retention

### Why Stewardship Matters

**It's Easier (and Cheaper) to Retain Donors Than Acquire New Ones**:

- Cost to acquire new donor: $1-$2 per $1 raised (Year 1)
- Cost to retain donor: $0.20-$0.50 per $1 raised
- Donor retention rate: 40-60% (nationally)—Foundation goal: 80%+

**Major Donors Give Again (If Stewarded Well)**:

- Year 1 donor → Year 2 donor (80% retention goal)
- Annual donor → Multi-year donor → Planned giving donor (cultivation ladder)

---

### Stewardship Best Practices

**The 7 Touches Rule**: Major donors should hear from Foundation 7+ times/year (NOT all asks—mix of thank-yous, updates, invitations)

**Touch Types**:

**1. Thank You** (Immediate):

- Phone call within 24 hours (Mark or board member calls donor)
- Handwritten thank-you note (within 48 hours)
- Official acknowledgment letter (tax receipt, within 1 week)

**2. Impact Report** (Quarterly):

- Personalized report: "Your gift of $25K funded..."
- Stories, photos, data (show impact)
- Not generic annual report—personalized to donor's gift

**3. Exclusive Updates** (Monthly or Quarterly):

- Major donor newsletter (not public newsletter—exclusive content)
- Behind-the-scenes updates (what's happening that general public doesn't see)
- Example: "We just submitted comment letter to FDA—here's what we said"

**4. Personal Check-Ins** (3-4x/year):

- Phone call from Mark or board member (not asking for $—just "How are you? Thought you'd want to know...")
- Update on specific interest (if donor passionate about research → research updates)

**5. Invitations to Exclusive Events** (2-3x/year):

- Major donor appreciation dinner
- Private briefing with AATD expert
- Board meeting observation (if donor interested in governance)

**6. Recognition** (As Appropriate):

- Public recognition (if donor wants—some prefer anonymity):
  - Website donor honor roll
  - Annual report "thank you" section
  - Event program acknowledgment
- Private recognition:
  - Named fund or award
  - Personal note from patient helped by their gift

**7. Opportunities to Engage** (Ongoing):

- Invite to serve on advisory committee
- Ask for advice (not money—leverage their expertise)
- Introduce to other donors (build community)

---

### Retention Strategies

**Multi-Year Pledges**:

- Ask for multi-year commitment ($25K over 3 years = $8,333/year)
- Benefits:
  - Easier for donor (smaller annual amount)
  - Predictable revenue for Foundation
  - Higher retention (less likely to lapse if committed for 3 years)

**Recurring Gifts**:

- Monthly or quarterly automatic gifts (credit card, ACH)
- Example: $833/month = $10K/year
- Highest retention rate (set-it-and-forget-it)

**Upgrade Asks**:

- After 2-3 years at same level, invite donor to increase
- Example: $10K donor (Year 1-2) → invite to $15K or $25K (Year 3)
- Frame as "increased impact" (not "we need more money")
