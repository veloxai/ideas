## Employee Giving Overview

### Why Employee Giving?

**Untapped Potential**: Employee giving represents a **stable, recurring revenue source** with benefits beyond dollars:

**Financial Benefits**:

- Recurring donations (monthly payroll deduction or annual campaign)
- Employer matching doubles impact (some companies match 2:1 or 3:1)
- Lower acquisition cost than individual donor campaigns
- Predictable revenue stream for budgeting

**Engagement Benefits**:

- Deepens employee connection to cause (workplace identity + personal values)
- Builds corporate partnership (Gateway to sponsorships, grants, Board recruitment)
- Volunteer pipeline (engaged employees volunteer)
- Ambassador network (employees advocate to friends, family, networks)

**Mission Benefits**:

- Workforce education about AATD (may recognize undiagnosed cases)
- Occupational health connection (firefighters, military, manufacturing - high AATD risk)
- Healthcare industry employees (can refer patients for testing)

### Employee Giving Goals (Years 1-3)

**Year 1: $75,000** (total employee giving)

- 10 workplace campaigns (small to mid-size companies)
- 500 employee donors
- Average gift: $150/year
- Employer matching: $25,000

**Year 2: $150,000**

- 25 workplace campaigns
- 1,200 employee donors
- Average gift: $175/year
- Employer matching: $60,000

**Year 3: $250,000+**

- Average gift: $200/year

## Workplace Giving Campaigns

### Campaign Models

**Model 1: Annual Campaign (Most Common)**

- Timing: Fall (September-November) or Spring (March-May)
- Duration: 2-4 weeks
- Format: In-person presentations, emails, pledge cards

- Employees can enroll in payroll deduction anytime (via HR portal or Foundation website)
- Promoted during onboarding, open enrollment, benefits fairs
- Low-key but consistent

**Model 3: Matching Gift Campaign**

- Employer pledges match (e.g., "$50,000 match available")
- Employees give, employer matches dollar-for-dollar (or 2:1)
- Creates urgency ("Don't leave match money on the table!")
- Typically annual, time-limited (30-60 days)

**Model 4: Volunteer + Giving Hybrid**

- Company sponsors volunteer day (e.g., pack care packages for AATD patients)
- Company donates $25 per volunteer hour
- Employees encouraged to add personal donations
- Builds team spirit and philanthropy

### Campaign Structure (Annual Model)

- Digital signage in common areas (lobby, cafeteria, elevators)
- Social media (if company has internal Slack, Teams, or Yammer)

**Phase 3: Campaign (Weeks 2-4)**

**Multi-Touch Communication**:

- **Week 4 Email**: "Last chance!" (urgency, deadline reminder)

## Employer Matching Gift Programs

### Overview

**What is a Matching Gift?**

- Employer matches employee's donation to eligible nonprofit
- Match ratios: 1:1 (most common), 2:1, or even 3:1
- Often has minimum ($25) and maximum ($5,000/year typical)
- May require employee to submit match request (with donation receipt)

**Why Companies Offer Matching Gifts**:

- Amplifies employee philanthropy (doubles or triples impact)
- Tax deduction for company
- Boosts employee satisfaction and retention
- Part of CSR or corporate giving strategy

**Foundation Opportunity**:

- Many donors don't know their employer matches (education opportunity!)
- Many eligible matches go unclaimed (~$4-7 billion annually nationwide)
- Foundation can capture $25K-$100K+ annually from matches

### Matching Gift Strategy

**Step 1: Identify Eligible Donors**

- Screen existing donor database for employees of matching-gift companies
- Tool: Double the Donation (database of 20,000+ matching-gift companies)
- Reach out: "Did you know your company matches gifts? Here's how..."

**Step 2: Educate Donors**

- Include matching gift info in every donation confirmation email
- Add matching gift widget to donation page (Double the Donation, 360MatchPro)
- Promote during workplace campaigns: "Don't leave match money on the table!"

**Step 3: Make It Easy**

- Provide step-by-step instructions for common companies (e.g., "How to submit IBM match")
- Offer to help complete match forms (some donors find it confusing)
- Follow up with donors who haven't submitted match: "Friendly reminder, you can double your impact!"

**Step 4: Track & Process Matches**

- Log matching gift requests in CRM
- Submit required documentation to company (donation receipt, IRS determination letter)
- Follow up if match not received within 6-8 weeks
- Thank donor for maximizing impact

### Top Matching Gift Companies

- Educate volunteers: "Did you know your time = $ for AATD?"

## Payroll Deduction Programs

### Setup & Administration

**How Payroll Deduction Works**:

1. Employee authorizes recurring deduction from paycheck
2. Employer deducts amount (pre-tax or post-tax, depending on company policy)
3. Employer aggregates all employee donations and sends to Foundation (monthly or quarterly)
4. Foundation receives lump sum with roster of donors and amounts

**Benefits**:

- **For Employees**: "Set it and forget it" giving, smaller amounts per paycheck more affordable
- **For Employer**: Simple administration (part of regular payroll process)
- **For Foundation**: Recurring, predictable revenue stream

**Setup Requirements**:

- Foundation must be approved nonprofit in company's payroll system
- Provide: EIN, IRS determination letter, W-9, bank info for ACH
- Company sets up Foundation as payroll deduction option (one-time setup)
- Employees can enroll during campaign or open enrollment

**Payroll Deduction Agreement** (template):

```
PAYROLL DEDUCTION AUTHORIZATION

Employee Name: _________________________  Employee ID: __________
Company: _______________________________  Department: ____________

I authorize [Company Name] to deduct the following amount from my
paycheck and remit to the Mark Egly Foundation (EIN: XX-XXXXXXX):

  Deduction Amount: $ _______ per [pay period / month / year]

  Start Date: ____________  End Date (if applicable): ____________

  □ This is a recurring deduction until I cancel
  □ This is a one-time deduction

I understand:
- I can cancel or change this deduction at any time by contacting HR
- Deductions are post-tax (not pre-tax)
- I will receive a tax receipt from the Foundation annually
- My donation information will be shared with the Foundation

Signature: _________________________  Date: ___________________

HR Approval: _______________________  Date: ___________________
```

### Recurring Giving Promotion

**Messaging**: Emphasize affordability and impact of recurring gifts

**Sample Messaging**:

- "Just $1/day = $365/year to fight AATD"
- "Skip one latte a month = $5/month = genetic test funded annually"
- "$25/month = sustaining donor status + quarterly impact updates"

**Incentives for Recurring Donors**:

- ✅ Make it personal: "1 in 2,500 people has AATD - it could be your coworker"
- ✅ Show urgency: "7-8 year average diagnostic delay - we can change that"

**Messaging Don'ts**:

- ❌ Overly medical jargon: Use plain language, define terms

## Conclusion

Employee giving programs represent a **strategic, scalable revenue opportunity** for the Mark Egly Foundation. By partnering with forward-thinking companies—especially those in healthcare, pharmaceutical, and high-risk occupations—we can engage thousands of employees as donors, volunteers, and ambassadors for AATD awareness.

**Key Success Factors**:

1. **Mission Alignment**: Target companies where AATD connection resonates (healthcare, occupational health)
2. **Internal Champions**: Recruit passionate employees to champion campaigns inside their companies
3. **Easy Participation**: Make giving simple (online, payroll deduction, employer match)
4. **Impact Storytelling**: Show employees how their gifts transform lives
5. **Stewardship**: Thank donors genuinely and often, show impact

**Our Vision**: By Year 3, employee giving will contribute $250,000+ annually, engaging 2,500+ employee donors across 50+ companies. These workplace partners will become long-term allies in the fight against AATD, providing not just financial support but also volunteers, advocates, and champions.

**Every workplace is a community. Every employee is a potential partner. Together, we can bring AATD awareness and support into workplaces across America.**
