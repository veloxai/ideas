## Cause Marketing

### What is Cause Marketing?

**Cause Marketing** = Business + Nonprofit partnership where company donates % of sales to charity

**Example**: "For every [Product] sold, [Company] donates $X to Mark Egly Foundation"

---

### Cause Marketing Benefits

**For Company**:

- Drives sales (customers want to buy from companies that give back)
- Brand differentiation (stand out from competitors)
- Positive PR (media coverage, social media buzz)

**For Foundation**:

- Revenue (% of sales)
- Brand awareness (company's marketing = free advertising for Foundation)
- New donor acquisition (customers become donors)

---

### Cause Marketing Examples

**Example 1: Golf Equipment Manufacturer**:

- **Partner**: Callaway Golf
- **Campaign**: "Drive for a Cure" (AATD awareness month, November)
- **Offer**: $10 from every golf club sold goes to Mark Egly Foundation
- **Promotion**: In-store signage, online ads, social media (#DriveForACure)
- **Projected Revenue**: 10,000 clubs sold × $10 = $100K

**Example 2: Pharmacy Chain**:

- **Partner**: CVS Health
- **Campaign**: "Test for AATD" (COPD Awareness Month, November)
- **Offer**: Free AATD screening at CVS MinuteClinics (sponsored by Foundation + CVS)
- **Promotion**: In-store posters, pharmacy bag inserts, social media
- **Projected Impact**: 1,000 people screened, 50 AATD cases identified

**Example 3: Genetic Testing Company**:

- **Partner**: 23andMe
- **Campaign**: "Know Your Alpha-1 Status"
- **Offer**: 23andMe adds AATD carrier screening to health reports; $5 from every health kit sold → Foundation
- **Promotion**: Email to 23andMe customers, blog post, Foundation social media
- **Projected Revenue**: 20,000 kits × $5 = $100K

### Cause Marketing Best Practices

**Do**:

- ✅ **Align values** (partner with companies whose values match Foundation's)
- ✅ **Clear messaging** (customers understand where money goes)
- ✅ **Time-limited** (urgency drives sales—"November only")
- ✅ **Track results** (measure sales, revenue, awareness)
- ✅ **Authentic** (genuine partnership, not just marketing gimmick)

**Don't**:

- ❌ **"Pinkwashing"** (superficial cause marketing—company benefits, charity gets little)
- ❌ **Unclear terms** (how much goes to Foundation? when? be transparent)
- ❌ **Misaligned partners** (e.g., tobacco company—conflicts with lung health mission)
