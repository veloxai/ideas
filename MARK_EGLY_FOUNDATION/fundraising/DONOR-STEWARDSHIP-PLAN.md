## Stewardship Philosophy

### What is Donor Stewardship?

**Stewardship** = Building long-term relationships with donors through gratitude, transparency, and meaningful engagement.

**NOT**: "Ask → Thank → Forget"
**YES**: "Thank → Report → Engage → Thank → Ask Again"

---

### Stewardship Principles

**1. Donor-Centricity**:

- ✅ Donors are partners, not ATMs
- ✅ Understand their motivations, preferences, interests
- ✅ Personalize communications (not one-size-fits-all)

**2. Gratitude First**:

- ✅ Thank donors promptly (within 48 hours of gift)
- ✅ Thank more than you ask (ratio: 7:1—7 touches for every 1 ask)
- ✅ Express genuine appreciation (not transactional)

**3. Transparency & Impact**:

- ✅ Show donors how their money is used
- ✅ Share successes (and challenges)
- ✅ Prove impact (data, stories, outcomes)

**4. Engagement**:

- ✅ Invite donors into Foundation's work (not just funding)
- ✅ Offer experiences (events, site visits, patient interactions)
- ✅ Build community (connect donors to each other)

**5. Long-Term Relationship**:

- ✅ Focus on lifetime value (not single gift)
- ✅ Move donors up giving ladder (annual → major → planned)
- ✅ Multi-generational relationships (donors' children, grandchildren)

---

### Stewardship Goals

**Year 1** (2026):

- 75% donor retention rate (industry average: 45%)
- 20% of first-time donors make second gift
- 50% of donors engaged (beyond just giving)

**Year 3** (2028):

- 80% donor retention rate
- 30% of first-time donors make second gift
- 75% of donors engaged

**Year 5** (2030):

- 85% donor retention rate
- 40% of first-time donors make second gift
- 90% of donors engaged

---

## Donor Segmentation

### Why Segment Donors?

**Personalization**: Different donors = different needs, interests, communication preferences

**Efficiency**: Focus high-touch stewardship on highest-value donors (80/20 rule)

---

## Major Donor Stewardship

### High-Touch Stewardship Plan (Major Donors $10K+)

**Goal**: Build deep, personal relationships with major donors (treat as individuals, not transactions)

---

### Stewardship Tactics

**1. Personal Meetings**:

- **Frequency**: 2-4x/year (in-person preferred, Zoom if distance)
- **Purpose**: Build relationship, listen, understand donor's interests, explore opportunities
- **Who**: CEO, Chief Development Officer, or Board member
- **Prep**:
  - Research donor (background, interests, past giving)
  - Prepare talking points (Foundation updates, impact stories, donor's specific interests)
  - Bring donor portfolio (history of giving, communications received)
- **Follow-Up**: Thank-you note within 24 hours, action items (if any)

**2. Exclusive Experiences**:

- **Lab Tour**: See AAT glucometer prototype, meet scientists
- **Patient Panel**: Hear directly from AATD patients (transformational for donors)
- **Research Symposium**: Attend Foundation-sponsored research conference
- **Advocacy Day**: Join Foundation on Capitol Hill (meet legislators)
- **Board Meeting**: Attend as observer (insider access)

**3. Personalized Communications**:

- **Handwritten Notes**: From CEO or Board Chair (birthdays, gift anniversaries, major milestones)
- **Phone Calls**: Quarterly check-ins (not asks—just relationship-building)
- **Personal Emails**: From CEO (not mass emails—1:1 updates)

**4. Donor-Centric Reporting**:

- **Custom Impact Reports**: Show specific impact of donor's gift (e.g., "Your $50K funded 500 AATD tests—here are the 25 patients diagnosed")
- **Quarterly Updates**: Email or printed booklet with photos, patient stories, data
- **Thank-You Videos**: Personalized video from CEO or patient thanking donor

**5. Peer Connections**:

- **Donor Dinners**: Small group dinners (8-10 major donors + CEO) for networking, shared learning
- **Major Donor Advisory Council**: Invite select major donors to advise on strategy (gives ownership)
- **Peer-to-Peer Fundraising**: Connect donors to their networks (e.g., "Would you host a dinner party for 10 friends?")

---

### Major Donor Moves Management

**Moves Management** = Strategic plan to move donor up giving ladder

**Example: Move Donor from $10K → $50K**:

**Step 1: Research & Planning**:

- Review donor's capacity (wealth screening—estimated net worth)
- Identify donor's interests (research? patient assistance? advocacy?)
- Set goal ($50K gift within 12 months)

**Step 2: Cultivation (Months 1-6)**:

- **Month 1**: Thank donor for $10K gift (personal call from CEO)
- **Month 2**: Invite donor to lab tour (see glucometer development)
- **Month 3**: Send personalized impact report (show how $10K was used)
- **Month 4**: Invite donor to exclusive donor briefing (strategy update)
- **Month 5**: Send patient thank-you video (patient saying thank you)
- **Month 6**: Personal meeting (CEO + donor)—discuss Foundation's vision, donor's interests

**Step 3: Solicitation (Month 7)**:

- **Ask**: CEO asks donor for $50K (in-person or Zoom)
- **Project**: "Your gift of $50K will fund the AAT glucometer clinical trial—this is the breakthrough we've been working toward."
- **Benefits**: Naming opportunity ("Jane Doe Glucometer Innovation Fund"), VIP tickets to gala, recognition

**Step 4: Stewardship (Months 8-12)**:

- **Month 8**: Thank you (CEO personal call + handwritten note)
- **Month 9**: Behind-the-scenes tour (meet research team)
- **Month 10**: Quarterly impact report
- **Month 11**: Invite to board meeting (observer)
- **Month 12**: Anniversary card + video update on glucometer progress

**Step 5: Renewal (Month 13)**:

- Ask for $50K+ renewal (or move to $100K)

## Retention Strategies

### Why Donor Retention Matters

**Industry Benchmark**: Average donor retention rate = 45% (more than half of donors don't give again!)

**Mark Egly Foundation Goal**: 75%+ retention (Year 1) → 85% (Year 5)

**Why It Matters**:

- **Cost**: Acquiring new donor = 5x more expensive than retaining existing donor
- **Lifetime Value**: Retained donors give more over time (increase gifts, refer others, leave planned gifts)
- **Loyalty**: Long-term donors become advocates, volunteers, ambassadors

---

### Retention Tactics

**1. Thank Promptly & Sincerely**:

- ✅ Thank within 48 hours (automated email + personal touch for Major Donors)
- ✅ Personalize thank-you (use donor's name, reference gift amount, explain impact)
- ✅ Thank more than you ask (7:1 ratio—7 thank-you touches per 1 ask)

**2. Prove Impact**:

- ✅ Show donors how their money was used (impact reports, patient stories, data)
- ✅ Be specific ("Your $500 paid for 5 AATD tests—here are the 2 patients diagnosed")
- ✅ Close the loop (report back on projects donors funded)

**3. Engage Beyond Giving**:

- ✅ Invite donors to events (gala, golf tournament, patient symposium)
- ✅ Encourage volunteerism (awareness campaigns, support groups, fundraising)
- ✅ Solicit input (surveys, focus groups, advisory councils)

**4. Segment & Personalize**:

- ✅ Different donors = different stewardship (Major Donors get high-touch, small donors get automated)
- ✅ Tailor messaging to donor's interests (patients get patient stories, researchers get research updates)

**5. Multi-Channel Communications**:

- ✅ Use mix of channels (email, mail, phone, events, social media)
- ✅ Test preferences (ask donors how they want to hear from Foundation)

**6. Renewal Campaigns**:

- ✅ Ask for renewal 12-13 months after last gift (don't wait too long)
- ✅ Reference last gift ("Last year you gave $500—will you renew your support?")
- ✅ Upgrade ask ("Would you consider increasing to $750?")

**7. Lapsed Donor Win-Back**:

- ✅ Identify lapsed donors (no gift in 12+ months)
- ✅ "We miss you" campaign (email series—"We noticed you haven't given recently. Here's what you've missed...")
- ✅ Survey (ask why they stopped giving—learn & improve)
- ✅ Special offer ("Rejoin with a gift of $100 and we'll match it")

---

### Retention Metrics (Track Monthly)

**Overall Retention Rate**:

- Formula: (# donors who gave this year AND last year) / (# donors who gave last year)
- Goal: 75% (Year 1) → 85% (Year 5)

**First-Time Donor Retention**:

- Formula: (# first-time donors who made second gift) / (# first-time donors)
- Goal: 20% (Year 1) → 40% (Year 5)
- **Critical Metric**: Acquiring donors is expensive—if they don't give again, Foundation loses money

**Retention by Segment**:

- Major Donors ($10K+): 90%+ retention
- Mid-Level ($1K-$9.9K): 80%+ retention
- Annual Fund ($100-$999): 60%+ retention
- Small (<$100): 40%+ retention

**Lapsed Donor Reactivation Rate**:

- Formula: (# lapsed donors who gave again) / (# lapsed donors)
- Goal: 10-15%

---

- # of touches per donor (by segment)
- Open rate on emails (industry average: 20-25%; goal: 30%+)
- Event attendance rate (# attendees / # invitations)

**Retention**:

- Overall retention rate (goal: 75%+)
- First-time donor retention (goal: 20%+)
- Lapsed donor reactivation rate (goal: 10-15%)

**Upgrades**:

- % of donors who increased gift (year-over-year)
- Average gift size (trending up?)
- # of donors moving up giving ladder (Annual → Mid-Level → Major)

**Donor Satisfaction**:

- Net Promoter Score (NPS)—survey question: "How likely are you to recommend Mark Egly Foundation to a friend?" (0-10 scale)
- Goal: NPS 50+ (excellent)
