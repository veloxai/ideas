## Grant Writing Principles

### The Foundation of Grant Success

**Principle 1: Alignment is Everything**

- Your project must align with funder's priorities (not just your needs)
- Read guidelines carefully, use funder's language
- Show how your work advances their mission

**Principle 2: Tell a Compelling Story**

- Start with the problem (human impact, urgency)
- Show why your solution is unique and effective
- Demonstrate measurable outcomes

**Principle 3: Demonstrate Credibility**

- Prove your organization can deliver (track record, expertise)
- Show sound financial management
- Include strong leadership and governance

**Principle 4: Be Specific and Concrete**

- Vague = weak; specific = strong
- Use data, examples, stories
- Clear metrics and evaluation plan

**Principle 5: Make it Easy to Say Yes**

- Organize clearly (use headings, bullets)
- Follow instructions exactly (page limits, font, format)
- Write clearly (no jargon, active voice)
- Answer all questions asked

---

## Pre-Application Research

### Step 1: Know Your Funder

**Research Questions**:

- What is funder's mission and priorities?
- What types of projects do they fund?
- What geographic areas? What population groups?
- What is typical grant size and duration?
- What are they NOT interested in funding?

**Where to Find Info**:

- Funder website (grant guidelines, past awards)
- Annual reports and IRS Form 990 (foundation tax return, shows all grants)
- News articles and press releases
- Candid/Foundation Directory (foundation profiles)

---

### Step 2: Review Past Grants

**Look for patterns**:

- Who received funding? (organization type, size, location)
- Project types funded (research, education, direct service)
- Grant amounts (range, average)
- Multi-year grants or one-time?
- Any repeat grantees? (funder values long-term relationships)

**Ask yourself**: Are we similar to past grantees? If not, why would we be funded?

---

### Step 3: Contact Program Officer (If Allowed)

**When to reach out**:

- Before LOI or full proposal (not after deadline)
- If guidelines unclear
- If want to confirm fit before investing time

**How to approach**:

- Email (concise, professional)
- Phone call (if funder prefers, shorter)
- In-person meeting (if local, after email introduction)

**What to ask**:

- "We're considering applying for [grant]. Does our project align with your priorities?"
- "Would you recommend we apply, or wait for a better fit?"
- "Any advice for our application?"
- "What makes a strong application in your view?"

**What NOT to do**:

- Ask them to review your draft proposal (unless they offer)
- Call multiple times
- Be pushy or entitled

**Note**: Some funders don't allow pre-application contact. Respect that.

---

### Step 4: Assess Your Fit

**Questions to ask**:

- Mission alignment: Does our project advance their goals? (90%+ match)
- Eligibility: Do we meet all requirements? (geography, organization type, project type)
- Funding level: Is grant size appropriate for our project?
- Capacity: Can we execute this project successfully?
- Competitive: How many applications will they receive? What's our edge?
- ROI: Is time investment worth potential return?

**Decision Rule**: Only proceed if 4+ of 6 questions = YES

---

## Proposal Components

### 1. Executive Summary / Cover Letter

**Purpose**: Hook the reader, summarize key points

**Length**: 1 page (or as specified)

**What to include**:

- Opening: Compelling statement (problem, urgency, human impact)
- Who you are: Organization name, mission, credibility
- The problem: Brief overview (data, why it matters)
- Your solution: Project summary (what, who, where, when)
- Funding request: Amount requested, project duration
- Impact: Expected outcomes (measurable, concrete)
- Closing: Thank them for considering, offer to provide more info

**Tone**: Confident but not arrogant, passionate but not emotional

**Example Opening**:

> "Every year, 100,000 Americans live with undiagnosed Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD), suffering through an average 7-8 year diagnostic odyssey. The Mark Egly Foundation is changing this reality through physician education, patient support, and innovative research—and we need your partnership to accelerate our impact."

---

### 2. Organizational Background

**Purpose**: Establish credibility and capacity

**Length**: 1-2 pages

**What to include**:

- **Mission and vision**: Why we exist
- **History**: When founded, by whom, key milestones
- **Programs and services**: What we do (brief overview)
- **Impact to date**: Key accomplishments (numbers, stories)
- **Leadership**: Board, executive team (credentials, diversity)
- **Financials**: Budget size, funding sources (diversified), financial health
- **Unique strengths**: What sets us apart (founder's story, patient-centered approach)

**Tips**:

- Tailor to funder (emphasize aspects relevant to their priorities)
- Use data (patients served, physicians trained, research funded)
- Include testimonials or brief quotes (board member, patient, partner)

---

### 3. Problem Statement / Need

**Purpose**: Make the case for why this project is needed

**Length**: 1-3 pages

**What to include**:

- **The problem**: What's wrong, who's affected, scope/scale
- **Evidence**: Data, statistics, research (cite sources)
- **Urgency**: Why now? What happens if we don't act?
- **Gap**: What's missing in current landscape?
- **Who's affected**: Target population (demographics, geography)
- **Root causes**: Why does this problem exist?
- **Connection to funder**: How does this align with their priorities?

**Structure**:

1. Hook: Start with compelling story or statistic
2. Scope: Quantify the problem (national, local)
3. Impact: Show human and societal cost
4. Gap: Explain why existing solutions inadequate
5. Bridge: Lead into your solution (next section)

**Example**:

> "AATD affects 1 in 2,500 Americans, yet only 10% are diagnosed. The average patient sees 4+ doctors and waits 7-8 years before diagnosis—years in which lung damage becomes irreversible. Why? 90% of primary care physicians report they 'rarely or never' think to test for AATD (Source: ATS Survey 2023). This diagnostic delay costs lives and billions in preventable healthcare spending."

---

### 4. Project Description / Methodology

**Purpose**: Explain your solution in detail

**Length**: 3-5 pages (most substantial section)

**What to include**:

**A. Goals and Objectives**:

- **Goal**: Broad, long-term outcome (e.g., "Reduce AATD diagnostic delays")

**F. Innovation**:

- What's new or unique about your approach?
- How is this different from what already exists?

**G. Barriers and Mitigation**:

- What could go wrong?
- How will you address challenges?

**Structure**:

- Use subheadings (Goals, Activities, Timeline, etc.)
- Bullet points and tables (easier to scan)
- Be specific (not vague generalities)

**Example Activity Description**:

> **Activity 1: CME Course Development (Months 1-3)**
> We will create a 1-hour online CME course, "AATD: Early Detection, Better Outcomes." The course will include:
>
> - 5 video modules (10-12 minutes each) featuring AATD specialists

## Writing Tips & Best Practices

### Clarity and Conciseness

✅ **DO**:

- Use short sentences (15-20 words max)
- Use active voice ("We will train physicians" not "Physicians will be trained")
- Use concrete, specific language ("500 physicians" not "many physicians")
- Define acronyms on first use (AATD, CME, etc.)
- Use subheadings, bullets, white space (easier to scan)

❌ **DON'T**:

- Use jargon or technical language (unless audience expects it)
- Use passive voice
- Use vague language ("substantial," "significant," "numerous")
- Write long, dense paragraphs (3-5 sentences max per paragraph)

---

### Evidence and Data

✅ **DO**:

- Cite sources for statistics (ATS, CDC, published research)
- Use recent data (within 5 years)
- Include patient stories (with permission, anonymized)
- Show your impact data (if available)

❌ **DON'T**:

- Make unsupported claims
- Use outdated data
- Rely only on anecdotes (balance with statistics)

---

### Tone

✅ **DO**:

- Be confident (not arrogant)
- Be passionate (not emotional/manipulative)
- Be professional (not stuffy)
- Show urgency (not desperation)

❌ **DON'T**:

- Beg or plead
- Be overly emotional
- Criticize others (other organizations, government, etc.)
- Make unrealistic promises

---

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Mistake 1**: Not following instructions

- Read guidelines carefully, follow exactly (font, margins, page limits, attachments)
- Answer every question asked
- Submit by deadline (preferably 2 days early)

❌ **Mistake 2**: Writing about your organization (not the funder's priorities)

- Lead with problem/need (not organization history)
- Show alignment with funder's mission
- Use funder's language (from guidelines, website)

❌ **Mistake 3**: Vague or unmeasurable objectives

- Bad: "Increase awareness of AATD"
- Good: "Train 500 physicians in AATD recognition, resulting in 20% increase in testing rates by December 2027"

❌ **Mistake 4**: Weak evaluation plan

- Don't just track activities (# workshops held)
- Track outcomes (knowledge gain, behavior change, health outcomes)
- Be realistic (don't promise to cure AATD in 1 year)

❌ **Mistake 5**: Budget errors

- Math errors (rows don't add up)
- Unallowable expenses (lobbying, political activities, alcohol)
- Insufficient budget narrative (explain line items)
- Budget doesn't match proposal (activities in narrative not budgeted)

---

## Budget Development

### Budget Components

**Personnel** (Salaries and Benefits):

- Staff salaries (list each position, % FTE, salary, % charged to grant)
- Fringe benefits (typically 25-35% of salaries)
- Consultants (contractors, external experts)

**Non-Personnel**:

- Travel (conferences, site visits, mileage)
- Supplies and materials (office supplies, educational materials)
- Equipment (computers, printers, furniture—if over $5K threshold)
- Space and occupancy (rent, utilities, phone/internet)
- Other direct costs (printing, postage, insurance, software licenses)
- Indirect costs (overhead, admin costs—if allowed by funder)

**Matching Funds** (if required):

- Cash match (money from other sources)
- In-kind match (donated goods, volunteer time, space)

---

### Budget Narrative

**For each line item, explain**:

- What it is
- Why it's necessary
- How calculated (formula)

**Example**:

> **Program Director (0.5 FTE, $70,000 annual salary): $35,000**
> The Program Director will oversee CME course development, manage partnerships with medical schools, and supervise course implementation. 50% of time dedicated to this project. Salary based on market rate for similar positions in healthcare nonprofits (Source: GuideStar Nonprofit Compensation Report).

---

### Budget Best Practices

✅ **DO**:

- Be realistic (not inflated, not bare bones)
- Align budget with activities (if you say you'll hire staff, budget for it)
- Include all costs (don't forget indirect costs, benefits, small items)
- Show match or cost-sharing (if applicable, demonstrates commitment)

❌ **DON'T**:

- Include unallowable costs (check funder guidelines)
- Pad budget (inflated costs)
- Submit budget with math errors
- Forget budget narrative (explain every line)
