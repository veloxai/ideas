## Pipeline Management System

### Pipeline Stages

**Stage 1: Identified** (200-300 grants/year)

- Grant opportunity discovered
- Added to database with basic info
- Not yet evaluated

**Stage 2: Qualified** (100-150 grants/year)

- Reviewed against fit criteria
- Meets basic eligibility
- Worth pursuing

**Stage 3: In Development** (30-50 grants/year)

- Actively writing proposal
- Gathering materials
- Assigned to grant writer

**Stage 4: Submitted** (20-40 grants/year)

- Application submitted by deadline
- Awaiting decision
- Following up with program officer

**Stage 5: Under Review** (10-30 grants at any time)

- Funder reviewing application
- May request additional info
- Decision pending

**Stage 6: Awarded** (10-20 grants/year by Year 3)

- Grant approved!
- Contract negotiation
- Move to Grant Management

**Stage 7: Declined** (10-20 grants/year)

- Application not funded
- Request feedback
- Update lessons learned

---

### Conversion Rates (Target)

**Year 1**:

- Identified → Qualified: 50%
- Qualified → In Development: 40%
- In Development → Submitted: 75%
- Submitted → Awarded: 30-40%

**Year 3** (mature system):

- Identified → Qualified: 60%
- Qualified → In Development: 50%
- In Development → Submitted: 85%
- Submitted → Awarded: 40-50%

**Overall Year 3 Pipeline**:

- 250 identified → 150 qualified → 75 in development → 60 submitted → 25 awarded

---

### Pipeline Health Metrics

**Healthy Pipeline Indicators**:

- ✅ 3-5x submitted applications vs. funding goal (e.g., $500K goal → $1.5-2.5M in applications)
- ✅ Mix of small ($10-50K), medium ($50-150K), large ($150K+) grants
- ✅ Mix of short-term (3-6 month decision) and long-term (6-12 month) grants
- ✅ No single funder >30% of total pipeline (diversification)
- ✅ 30-40% win rate (if lower, strategy needs adjustment)

**Unhealthy Pipeline Indicators**:

- ❌ Too few applications (<10/year) → won't hit funding goal
- ❌ Too many applications (>50/year) → quality suffering, burnout
- ❌ Only large grants (high risk—if lose, big funding gap)
- ❌ Only small grants (can't scale)
- ❌ Win rate <20% (applying to wrong grants or weak proposals)

- Win 5-7 grants ($200-300K)
- Learn and refine

**Year 3 Maturity**:
