## Events Overview

### Why Events Matter

**Benefits Beyond Revenue**:

- ✅ **Community Building**: Bring patients together (in-person connection—reduce isolation, build support network)
- ✅ **Awareness**: Reach new audiences (participants' networks—family, friends, coworkers learn about AATD)
- ✅ **Donor Acquisition**: Convert participants to ongoing donors (30-40% of event participants donate again—lifecycle engagement)
- ✅ **Brand Visibility**: Media coverage, social media (event photos, stories—amplify Foundation's reach)
- ✅ **Volunteer Engagement**: Activate supporters (committee members, day-of volunteers—deeper investment)

**Revenue Potential**:

- Year 1: $100K-$200K (1-2 events—modest start, proof of concept)
- Year 3: $500K-$750K (5-6 events—portfolio diversified, recurring events optimized)
- Year 5: $1M-$1.5M (10+ events—mature program, multiple cities, strong brand recognition)

## Event Portfolio Strategy

### Three-Tiered Approach

**Tier 1: Signature Events** (2 events—cornerstones of fundraising calendar)

- **Breathe Easy Walk** (Fall—September/October, National AATD Awareness Month)
- **An Evening for Alpha-1 Gala** (Spring—April/May, high-end donors, sponsors)

**Goal**: $350K-$800K combined (60-70% of event revenue—flagship events with highest visibility, attendance)

---

**Tier 2: Supplemental Events** (4-6 events—diversify revenue, engage different audiences)

- **Virtual 5K** (Summer—June, accessible nationwide, low overhead)
- **Golf Tournament** (Summer—July, corporate sponsors, high-net-worth individuals)
- **Donor Appreciation Event** (Winter—December, stewardship, no hard ask—retain major donors)
- **Patient Retreat** (Spring—March, community-building, modest fundraising via registration fees)

**Goal**: $200K-$400K combined (30-40% of event revenue—complement signature events)

---

**Tier 3: Peer-to-Peer & Third-Party** (ongoing—supporter-driven, minimal Foundation staff time)

- **Birthday Fundraisers** (Facebook, Classy—supporters ask friends to donate instead of gifts)
- **DIY Events** (supporters host—bake sales, trivia nights, fitness challenges—Foundation provides toolkit)
- **Corporate Team Events** (company organizes 5K, auction, etc.—Foundation receives proceeds)

**Goal**: $100K-$300K combined (10-20% of event revenue—high margin, scalable)

---

## Signature Event: Breathe Easy Walk

### Event Overview

**Concept**: Community walk (3K or 5K—non-competitive, family-friendly) + health fair + program (speakers, patient stories, entertainment)

**When**: September/October (National AATD Awareness Month—media hooks, maximize visibility)

**Where**: Local park with trails (Metropark, waterfront—scenic, accessible, free venue)

**Target Audience**:

- AATD patients + families (primary participants—personal connection, motivated fundraisers)
- Healthcare professionals (pulmonologists, respiratory therapists—educational opportunity, show support)
- Corporate teams (company sponsors send employee teams—team-building, CSR activity)
- General public (walkers without AATD connection—friend invited them, interested in health cause)

**Revenue Goal**:

- Year 1: $150K (500 participants, $300 average)
- Year 3: $250K (750 participants, $333 average—growth through sponsorships, larger teams)
- Year 5: $300K (1,000 participants, $300 average—mature event, multiple cities)

---

### Event Components

**1. Walk** (Main Activity):

- Route: 3K or 5K (choose based on venue—clearly marked, marshals at intersections)
- Start time: 9:00 AM (finish by 11:00 AM—allows time for post-walk program)
- Registration: On-site + online (encourage online pre-registration—easier logistics, higher fundraising)
- T-shirts: Included for all participants (branded—"Breathe Easy Walk 2026," sponsor logos, serves as walking advertisement)

**2. Health Fair** (8:00 AM-12:00 PM):

- Booths: 10-20 vendors (augmentation therapy companies, oxygen suppliers, health systems, fitness centers)
- Free screenings: Spirometry (lung function), blood pressure, BMI (attract attendees, education)
- Educational materials: AATD brochures, testing info, patient resources (Foundation literature at all booths)

**3. Program** (11:00 AM-12:00 PM, after walk):

- Welcome & thank-you (Foundation ED—recognize sponsors, top fundraisers, volunteers)
- Patient speaker (10-15 min—powerful personal story, emotional hook)
- Research update (5 min—Foundation's Chief Science Officer or researcher—tangible impact of donations)
- Awards (top fundraisers, largest team, most spirited team—recognition drives participation)
- Closing (encourage registration for next year, promote other Foundation programs)

**4. Kids' Zone** (8:00 AM-12:00 PM):

- Activities: Face painting, balloon animals, games (keep children entertained—parents can participate in walk, health fair)
- Volunteers: High school students (service hours—free labor, builds youth engagement)

**5. Food & Beverage** (Post-Walk):

- Light breakfast: Bagels, fruit, coffee (8:00-9:00 AM—pre-walk fuel)
- Post-walk snacks: Granola bars, bananas, water (finish line—immediate gratification)
- Lunch option: Food trucks (optional purchase—generate vendor revenue for Foundation, keep attendees on-site longer)

---

### Revenue Streams

**1. Individual Fundraising** ($90K-$180K—60% of revenue):

- Minimum pledge: $0 (no barrier—anyone can walk, but encouraged to fundraise)
- Average raised: $150-$200 per participant (individual asks friends/family—some raise $0, others $500+, average balances out)
- Top fundraisers: $1K-$5K (competitive individuals, patient advocates—highly motivated)
- **Mechanism**: Participants create fundraising pages (Classy, Eventbrite—share via email, social media, collect donations)

**2. Corporate Sponsorships** ($40K-$80K—27% of revenue):

- Presenting Sponsor: $20K (1 sponsor—logo on T-shirts, banners, maximum visibility)
- Gold Sponsor: $10K (2 sponsors—booth at health fair, logo on materials)
- Silver Sponsor: $5K (3-5 sponsors—booth, logo on website)
- Bronze Sponsor: $2.5K (5-10 sponsors—logo on website, social media recognition)
- In-Kind Sponsors: Food, water, T-shirts, tents (reduce expenses—improve net profit)

**3. Teams** ($15K-$30K—10% of revenue):

- Corporate teams: $2.5K-$10K per team (10-50 employees, each raises $100-$200—company often provides matching gift)
- Family teams: $500-$2K (5-10 family members—support AATD relative)
- Challenge teams: Create friendly competition (highest-raising team wins prize—drives fundraising)

**4. Day-of Registration** ($5K-$10K—3% of revenue):

- Walk-up participants: $50 per person (no fundraising—pay to walk, receive T-shirt)
- Typically 50-100 people (neighbors see event, join spontaneously—bonus revenue)

**Total Revenue**: $150K-$300K

---

### Expenses & ROI

**Fixed Costs** ($30K-$50K):

- **T-shirts**: $7-$10 each × 500-1,000 = $3.5K-$10K (bulk order, 2-3 color design)
- **Tent rentals**: $500-$2K (registration tent, sponsor tents, health fair—10-20 tents)
- **Signage**: $1K-$3K (banners, directional signs, sponsor boards—printed vinyl)
- **Permits**: $500-$1K (city/park permit, insurance—required for public events)
- **Portable toilets**: $500-$1K (rent additional beyond park facilities—avoid long lines)

- **Insurance**: $1K-$2K (event liability—required by venues)
- **Miscellaneous**: $2K-$5K (medals/awards, kids' activities, volunteer T-shirts, emergency medical—contingency)

**Variable Costs** (scale with attendance):

- More participants = more T-shirts, water, food (but also more revenue—costs proportional)

**Total Expenses**: $30K-$75K (25-35% of revenue)

**Net Profit**: $100K-$225K (65-75% margin—strong ROI for signature event)

---

- Tiered asks: Start high ($10K, $5K—anchor high gifts), work down ($2.5K, $1K, $500—everyone can participate)

**Total Revenue**: $200K-$500K

---

### Expenses & ROI

- **Venue rental**: $5K-$15K (ballroom, depending on size, city—negotiate if sponsor donates venue)

- **Auctioneer**: $2K-$5K (professional auctioneer—drives bidding, maximizes auction revenue, worth the cost)

---

### Timeline (9-12 Month Planning Cycle)

**Month 1-3 (July-September, Year Prior): Foundation**

- Form Gala Committee (10-15 members—high-net-worth donors, board members, corporate connections)
- Set date, book venue (Saturday evening, avoid holidays, book 9-12 months ahead—venues fill up)
- Recruit Gala Chair (prominent community leader—uses personal network to sell tables, secure sponsorships)
- Set budget, revenue goal ($200K-$500K)

**Month 4-6 (October-December): Sponsorships & Honoree**

- Select honoree (Community Champion—someone with broad network, will buy table + encourage others to attend)
- Sponsor prospecting (committee divides list—each member personally asks 3-5 companies for sponsorship)
- Goal: Secure 50-75% of sponsorship revenue by end of year (funds upfront costs—venue deposit, AV, printing)

**Month 7-9 (January-March): Ticket Sales & Auction Procurement**

- Launch save-the-dates (January—email + print, high-quality design)
- Invitations (mail 6-8 weeks before event—formal invitation, RSVP card, reply envelope)
- Table sales push (committee members each commit to selling 1-2 tables—10-20 tables = 100-200 attendees)
- Procure auction items (solicit donations—travel agencies, retailers, experiences, board members' connections)

**Month 10 (April, Event Month): Final Details**

- Confirm attendance (final headcount to caterer 1 week before—guarantee minimum)

---

## Virtual Events

### Concept: Accessible, Low-Overhead, Scalable

**Why Virtual?**

- ✅ **Nationwide reach**: No geographic limits (patients in Alaska can participate—expand donor base)
- ✅ **Low cost**: No venue, catering, decor (90%+ profit margin—almost pure revenue)
- ✅ **Convenient**: Participate from home (busy families, those with limited mobility—remove barriers)
- ✅ **Flexible**: Run anytime (not weather-dependent, easier to schedule)

**When to Use**:

- During pandemic/restrictions (replace in-person events—maintain fundraising momentum)
- Supplement in-person (summer virtual 5K—fills gap between Walk and Gala)
- Pilot new markets (test event in new city virtually before committing to in-person)

---

### Virtual 5K

**Concept**: Participants run/walk 5K on their own (anytime during event week—track via honor system or fitness app), share photos, fundraise online

**Duration**: 1 week (e.g., June 1-7—participants complete 5K anytime during week)

**Registration Fee**: $25-$50 (includes T-shirt, race bib mailed to home, finisher medal—tangible items maintain connection)

**Fundraising**: Participants create online fundraising pages (encouraged to raise $100+, but no minimum—some raise $0, others $1K+)

**Revenue**:

- 500 participants × $50 registration = $25K
- 500 × $100 average fundraising = $50K
- **Total**: $75K

**Expenses**:

- T-shirts: $7 × 500 = $3.5K
- Medals: $3 × 500 = $1.5K
- Shipping: $5 × 500 = $2.5K
- Platform fee: $2K (Classy—registration, fundraising pages)
- Marketing: $1K (social media ads, email campaigns)
- **Total**: $10.5K

**Net Profit**: $64.5K (86% margin—extremely efficient)

---

### Virtual Gala or "Un-Gala"

**Concept**: Livestreamed program (patient stories, fund-a-need, online auction—watch from home, donate via phone/computer)

**When**: Any evening (7:00-8:30 PM—short program, respect audience attention span)

**Components**:

- Livestream (YouTube Live, Facebook Live, or Zoom—30-60 min program)
- Online auction (mobile bidding—runs for 1 week before livestream, closes during event)
- Fund-a-need (during livestream—text-to-give or online form, real-time donation thermometer)
- "Dinner at home" (attendees order their own fancy dinner, toast with wine during event—create gala feel at home)

**Revenue**:

- 200-500 viewers (households, not individuals—undercount compared to in-person)
- Online auction: $10K-$30K (fewer items, lower values than in-person—but zero overhead)
- Fund-a-need: $20K-$50K (emotional appeal still works virtually—convenient giving)
- **Total**: $30K-$80K

**Expenses**:

- Production: $2K-$5K (videographer, streaming platform, graphics—professional quality matters)
- Platform fee: $1K-$2K (auction software, payment processing)
- Marketing: $1K-$2K
- **Total**: $4K-$9K

**Net Profit**: $26K-$71K (85-90% margin—not as high absolute dollars as in-person gala, but much lower risk/investment)

---

## Peer-to-Peer Campaigns

### Concept: Empower Supporters to Fundraise

**How It Works**:

- Foundation sets campaign theme (e.g., "Run for a Reason," "Breathe Easy Birthday Challenge," "30 Days, 30 Miles")
- Supporters create personal fundraising pages (Classy, Facebook—set goal, tell their story)
- Supporters raise funds from their networks (email friends/family, post on social media, personal asks)
- Foundation provides toolkit (email templates, social media graphics, fundraising tips—make it easy)

**Benefits**:

- ✅ **Scalable**: Unlimited participants (Foundation effort doesn't scale linearly—same toolkit serves 10 or 1,000 fundraisers)
- ✅ **Authentic**: Peer asks more effective than institutional asks ("Help me honor my mom who had AATD" > "Donate to our Foundation")
- ✅ **Donor acquisition**: Each fundraiser brings their network (friends/family may never have heard of AATD—expand reach)

---

### Campaign Examples

**1. Facebook Birthday Fundraisers**

**Setup**:

- Enable on Facebook (Foundation creates charity page—verified by Facebook, allows users to create birthday fundraisers)
- Automated (Facebook prompts users on birthday—"Raise money for Mark Egly Foundation instead of gifts")

**Promotion**:

- Email Foundation community (encourage everyone to set up birthday fundraiser—"Instead of gifts this year, ask friends to donate to AATD research")
- Recognize top fundraisers (monthly spotlight—thank-you post, feature on Foundation page)

**Revenue**:

- Avg birthday fundraiser: $200-$500 (20-30 friends donate $10-$25 each)
- If 100 supporters do birthday fundraiser/year: $20K-$50K (passive revenue, zero Foundation cost—Facebook doesn't charge fees!)

---

**2. Athletic Challenge (30 for 30)**

**Concept**: Supporters commit to athletic goal (30 miles in 30 days, 30 min exercise daily for 30 days—flexible to all fitness levels), fundraise to support effort

**Duration**: 1 month (run anytime—June, January [New Year's resolution], September [AATD Awareness Month])

**Promotion**:

- Launch email + social media (call for participants—"Sign up today!")
- Provide tracker (Excel spreadsheet or app—log daily miles/minutes, share progress)
- Weekly check-ins (email updates—motivational quotes, fundraising tips, leaderboard)
- Celebration (finisher certificate, social media shout-out—recognize completion)

**Revenue**:

- 100 participants × $250 average fundraising = $25K
- **Expense**: $500 (marketing, platform fee)
- **Net**: $24.5K (98% margin)

---

**3. Holiday Giving Campaign ("Give the Gift of Breath")**

**Timing**: November-December (Giving Tuesday, year-end giving—peak philanthropy season)

**Concept**: Supporters create fundraising pages (ask friends/family to donate in honor of loved one with AATD—holiday giving theme)

**Promotion**:

- Giving Tuesday kickoff (email, social media—"Start your holiday fundraiser today!")
- Weekly themes (Week 1: "Give in honor of a loved one," Week 2: "Give hope to patients," Week 3: "Give to find the cure," Week 4: "Give to finish strong!")
- Matching gift challenge (if major donor offers match—"All gifts doubled through Dec 31!"—urgency)

**Revenue**:

- 200 fundraisers × $300 average = $60K
- **Expense**: $2K (marketing, platform)
- **Net**: $58K (97% margin)

---

## Third-Party Events

### Concept: Supporters Host Events, Foundation Benefits

**How It Works**:

- Individual, company, or community group organizes event (bake sale, trivia night, golf outing, concert—supporter's idea, their execution)
- Foundation designated as beneficiary (proceeds donated to Foundation)
- Foundation provides support (materials, tax info, promotion—minimal staff time)

**Examples**:

- **Bar trivia night**: Local bar donates proceeds from trivia ($5 entry, 50 teams = $250)
- **Bake sale**: Elementary school class sells baked goods ($500-$1K)
- **Concert**: Local band performs, tickets sold ($10 each, 100 attendees = $1K)
- **Corporate team event**: Company organizes internal 5K, donates registration fees ($2K-$10K)

**Revenue**: $5K-$50K per event (varies widely—depends on organizer's effort, network)

**Foundation Investment**: Near-zero (provide logo, tax ID, maybe send t-shirts or brochure—but organizer handles everything else)

**ROI**: Infinite (100% profit—no Foundation expense)

### Third-Party Event Toolkit

**Foundation Provides**:

1. **Guidelines document** (1-pager—how to host event, timeline, legal considerations, best practices)
2. **Logo & branding** (high-res logo files, brand colors—organizer uses on flyers, social media)
3. **Tax info** (EIN, 501(c)(3) letter—if donors want tax receipts)
4. **Promotional support** (Foundation shares event on social media, newsletter—amplify reach)
5. **Thank-you & recognition** (certificate for organizer, public thank-you post—stewardship)

**Organizer Responsibilities**:

- Plan & execute event (Foundation not involved in logistics—liability stays with organizer)
- Collect funds (organizer's responsibility—send check or wire transfer to Foundation after event)
- Report results (final donation amount, participant count—Foundation tracks for recognition, metrics)

**Legal Considerations**:

- Liability waiver (organizer signs—Foundation not responsible for injuries, accidents at third-party event)
- Branding guidelines (organizer agrees to use logo appropriately—no misrepresentation, Foundation has veto over event if off-brand)

## Event Economics & ROI

### Cost-Per-Dollar-Raised Benchmarks

| Event Type          | Expense Ratio | Net Margin | Industry Benchmark                       |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Walk**            | 25-35%        | 65-75%     | 30-50% (Foundation above average)        |
| **Gala**            | 40-50%        | 50-60%     | 40-60% (Foundation competitive)          |
| **Virtual 5K**      | 10-15%        | 85-90%     | 15-30% (Foundation excellent)            |
| **Golf Tournament** | 30-40%        | 60-70%     | 35-50% (Foundation strong)               |
| **Peer-to-Peer**    | 2-5%          | 95-98%     | 5-15% (Foundation best-in-class)         |
| **Third-Party**     | 0-2%          | 98-100%    | Variable (Foundation maximum efficiency) |

**Foundation's Portfolio Target**: 20-30% overall expense ratio (across all events—$1.5M revenue, $300K-$450K expenses, $1.05M-$1.2M net)

---

### Non-Financial ROI

**Donor Acquisition**:

- 30-40% of event participants donate again within 12 months (convert to ongoing donors—lifecycle value)
- Cost per new donor: $50-$100 (acquire via events, cheaper than direct mail [$150-$300] or online ads [$200-$500])

**Awareness & Reach**:

- Social media impressions: 100K-500K per major event (participant posts, Foundation content—organic reach)
- Media coverage: Local news features (human interest story—patient participation, community impact)

**Community Building**:

- In-person connection (patients meet each other—reduce isolation, build support network, non-financial value immense)
- Volunteer engagement (100-200 volunteers across events—deepens commitment, pipeline for board, major donors)

---

## Marketing & Promotion

### Multi-Channel Strategy

**Email** (Primary channel for event promotion):

- Foundation database (send 8-12 emails per event—save-the-date through day-before reminder)
- Segmentation (send relevant content—past event participants get early-bird discount, major donors get VIP invite, general list gets standard invitation)

**Social Media**:

- Frequency: 2-3 posts/week (during promotion period—4-8 weeks before event)
- Content: Registration links, fundraising tips, participant spotlights, countdown graphics, sponsor thank-yous
- Paid ads: $1K-$5K per event (Facebook/Instagram—target local zip codes [Walk, Gala] or nationwide [Virtual 5K])

**Direct Mail**:

- For gala only (upscale printed invitation—signal quality, formality)
- For walk (postcard to past participants—"Save the date! Register early for discount!")

**Local Media**:

- Press releases (send to newspapers, radio, TV—3-4 weeks before event, again week-of)
- Community calendars (free listings—libraries, community centers, online event calendars)
- Radio PSAs (30-sec spot—run on community stations, free public service airtime)

**Partnerships**:

- AATD clinics (ask clinics to promote to patients—email, flyers in waiting room)
- Augmentation therapy companies (if sponsors—use their channels to promote, reach broader patient base)
- Corporate sponsors (ask to promote internally—intranet, all-hands meetings, drive employee participation)

---

### Registration Incentives

**Early-Bird Discounts**:

- Walk: $25 vs. $30 (register by Aug 1 vs. day-of—encourages early commitment, easier forecasting)
- Gala: $250 vs. $300 (register by March 1 vs. April—lock in attendance, improve cash flow)

**Team Discounts**:

- Walk: "Form team of 10+, save $5/person" (encourage corporate teams, family teams—build participation)

**Fundraising Prizes**:

- Top individual fundraiser: Grand prize ($500 Amazon gift card, weekend getaway, VIP gala tickets—motivate competitive fundraisers)
- Top team: Trophy, recognition on website, photo in newsletter (social recognition powerful motivator)
- Fundraising milestones: Digital badges ($250, $500, $1K raised—gamification)

**Referral Bonuses**:

3. **Expense ratio**: Expenses / revenue (25-50% target—efficiency)
4. **Net profit**: Revenue - expenses (dollars available for mission—ultimate goal)
5. **Participant satisfaction**: Post-event survey (Net Promoter Score—"Would you attend again? Recommend to friend?")
6. **Fundraising participation rate**: % who fundraised beyond registration fee (40-60% goal—indicates engagement)

### Program-Level KPIs

**Across All Events, Track**:

1. **Total event revenue**: $100K (Y1) → $500K (Y3) → $1.5M (Y5)—growth trajectory
2. **Portfolio expense ratio**: 20-30% (efficient operations—maximize net for mission)
3. **Donor retention**: % of event participants who donate again within 12 months (30-40% target)
4. **Volunteer engagement**: # of volunteers (increase year-over-year—capacity building)
5. **Media impressions**: Social reach, press mentions (awareness—hard to quantify but directionally important)

- ✅ **Revenue**: $1M-$1.5M annually (Year 5—funds 10-15% of Foundation budget, diversifies income)
- ✅ **Donor pipeline**: 30-40% of participants become ongoing donors (events are acquisition engine—feed major gifts, planned giving)
- ✅ **Community**: Patients connect in-person (reduce isolation—events create movement, not just organization)
- ✅ **Awareness**: Reach thousands (participants' networks—exponential visibility growth)

**5-Year Vision**: Portfolio of signature events (Walk, Gala) + supplemental events (Virtual 5K, Golf) + peer-to-peer campaigns (ongoing)—diversified, sustainable, scalable
