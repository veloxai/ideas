- Real-world evidence (registry data supplements clinical trials—broader generalizability)

**Quality Improvement**:

- Benchmarking (centers compare outcomes—"Why does Cleveland Clinic have lower hospitalization rate? Let's learn from them.")
- Identify best practices (data-driven—not opinion-based)

**Patient Benefit**:

- Personalized care (algorithms predict who will progress faster—intensify monitoring, early intervention)

---

### Data Collection Protocol

**Minimum Dataset** (All Centers Submit Annually):

- **Demographics**: Age, sex, race/ethnicity, zip code
- **Genetics**: Genotype (ZZ, SZ, MZ, etc.), family history
- **Clinical**: FEV1, FVC, CT emphysema score, liver enzymes (AST, ALT), BMI
- **Treatment**: Augmentation therapy (yes/no, start date), lung transplant (yes/no, date)
- **Outcomes**: Exacerbations/year, hospitalizations/year, mortality

**Enhanced Dataset** (Optional, Incentivized with Bonus $25K):

- **Biospecimens**: Blood, DNA, sputum (stored in biorepository—future research)
- **Imaging**: CT scans uploaded (centrally analyzed—standardized emphysema quantification)
- **Patient-Reported Outcomes**: Quality of life (SGRQ, SF-36), symptoms (CAT score), treatment satisfaction

**Data Security**:

- HIPAA-compliant (de-identified data—no names, MRNs, only coded IDs)
- Secure portal (REDCap or similar—encrypted, audit trails)
- Data use agreements (centers + Foundation sign—define permitted uses, prevent misuse)

---
