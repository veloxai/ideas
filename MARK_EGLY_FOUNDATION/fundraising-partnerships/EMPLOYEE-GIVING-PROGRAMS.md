## Program Overview

### The Opportunity: Tap Into Workplace Philanthropy

**Market Size**:

- $5.8 billion raised through workplace giving annually (US—United Way, company campaigns, donor-advised funds)
- Average employee donation: $250-$500/year (payroll deduction—small amounts, big impact)
- 65% of companies offer matching gifts (doubles employee donations—2x fundraising power)
- 84% of employees more likely to donate if employer matches (matching drives participation)

**Foundation's Goal**:

- Year 1: Partner with 10 companies (5,000 employees—$50K-$100K raised)
- Year 3: 50 companies (25,000 employees—$500K raised)
- Year 5: 200 companies (100,000 employees—$2M-$3M raised, sustainable revenue stream)

---

### Three Program Types

**1. Payroll Deduction Campaigns**:

- Employees pledge monthly donation ($5, $10, $25—deducted from paycheck automatically)
- Company matches (50% or 100%—doubles impact)
- Set-it-and-forget-it (recurring revenue—once enrolled, continues indefinitely)

**2. Employer Matching Gift Programs**:

- Employees donate directly to Foundation (website, mail, events)
- Submit match request to employer (HR portal—employer verifies, sends matching gift)
- Foundation receives 2x-3x original donation (many companies match 1:1, some 2:1 or 3:1)

**3. Corporate Charity of the Year**:

- Company selects Foundation as annual charity partner (fundraising focus for 12 months)
- Activities: Payroll campaign, fundraising events, volunteer days, executive giving
- Revenue: $50K-$500K per company (depending on company size, employee engagement)

---

## Why Employee Giving Works

### Benefits to Foundation

**1. Recurring Revenue**:

- Monthly payroll deductions = predictable income (unlike one-time donations—budgetable, sustainable)
- High retention (90%+ continue giving year-over-year—once enrolled, rarely stop)
- Compounds over time (employee stays at company 5-10 years—$250/year × 10 years = $2,500+ lifetime value)

**2. Donor Acquisition**:

- Reach new audiences (company employees—may have no prior connection to AATD, but employer campaign introduces them)
- Low cost per donor (company handles marketing, payroll setup—Foundation minimal effort, high return)
- Younger donors (millennials, Gen Z increasingly care about corporate social responsibility—workplace giving aligns with values)

**3. Corporate Engagement**:

- Builds relationships (company leadership—opens doors to major gifts, board recruitment, sponsorships)
- Validation (corporate endorsement—"If Boeing supports them, they must be legit"—builds credibility)

---

### Benefits to Employers

**1. Employee Engagement**:

- Boost morale (employees feel company cares—shared purpose, team building)
- Retention tool (70% of millennials more likely to stay with socially responsible employer—workplace giving part of benefits package)
- Corporate culture (philanthropy reinforces values—caring, community-focused organization)

**2. Tax Benefits**:

- Employer match is tax-deductible (charitable contribution—reduces corporate tax burden)
- CSR goals (many companies have giving targets—e.g., donate 1% of revenue to charity, workplace giving helps hit targets)

**3. Positive PR**:

- Community impact stories (company newsletter, social media—"Our team raised $100K for AATD research!"—positive brand association)
- Recruitment tool (attract talent—candidates research company values, workplace giving demonstrates commitment to social good)

---

### Why Employees Participate

**Convenience**:

- Payroll deduction (automatic—no need to write check, remember to donate)
- Small amounts (easier to give $10/paycheck vs. $260 lump sum—psychologically more manageable)

**Matching Amplifies Impact**:

- "My $10 becomes $20" (employer match doubles donation—feels more meaningful)
- "Company will match up to $500" (incentive to give—don't leave match on table)

**Social Proof**:

- Peer participation (if 30% of team donates, others more likely to join—belonging, team identity)
- Leadership example (if CEO gives, employees follow—top-down influence)

**Connection to Cause**:

- Personal tie (employee or family member has AATD—colleagues rally to support)
- Education (campaign introduces AATD—even without personal connection, story resonates—"Only 10% diagnosed? We need to fix that!")

---

## Corporate Partnership Model

### Three-Tiered Approach

**Tier 1: Turnkey Partners** (Existing Workplace Giving Platforms)

**Platforms**:

- **Benevity** (used by Apple, Microsoft, Google—employees donate, company matches, platform handles processing)
- **YourCause** (Blackbaud product—used by Fortune 500 companies)
- **United Way** (traditional workplace campaign—many companies still use)
- **America's Charities** (coalition of nonprofits—employees select from menu, includes AATD causes)

**Foundation's Action**:

- Register on platforms ($0-$500/year—some free, some charge small fee)
- Create profile (mission, impact stories, photos—compelling pitch)
- Wait for employee donations (passive—employees search for "AATD" or "lung disease," find Foundation, donate)

**Pros**:

- Low effort (platform handles everything—no need for Foundation to build tech, process payments)
- Broad reach (millions of employees—Benevity alone serves 20M+ workers)

**Cons**:

- Competitive (thousands of charities—hard to stand out, relies on employee awareness of AATD)
- Low awareness (if employees don't search for AATD, they won't find Foundation—need to drive visibility)

**Expected Revenue**: $10K-$50K/year (passive donations, some matches—baseline with minimal effort)

---

**Tier 2: Direct Company Partnerships** (One-Off Campaigns)

**Approach**:

- Identify target companies (industries with AATD prevalence—healthcare, manufacturing, or companies with AATD patient/family as employee)
- Pitch partnership (meet with HR, CSR team—propose payroll campaign, matching gift promotion)
- Co-create campaign (Foundation provides materials—presentation, video, posters, HR provides logistics, payroll setup)
- Run campaign (3-4 weeks—kickoff event, email reminders, thermometer tracker, celebration when goal hit)

**Company Commitment**:

- Promote campaign (emails, intranet, team meetings—educate employees about Foundation)
- Payroll deduction setup (HR configures—employees opt in, deductions start next pay period)
- Matching gift (50%-100% match—doubles employee contributions)

**Foundation Provides**:

- Turnkey materials (email templates, posters, video, FAQs—company just plugs in)
- Lunch-and-learn speaker (Foundation staff or patient—present to employees, share story, inspire giving)
- Impact reporting (post-campaign—thank-you video, show what donations funded, recognize company/employees)

**Pros**:

- Higher engagement (direct partnership—company actively promotes, not just passive listing on platform)
- Larger donations (focused campaign drives participation—30-50% of employees vs. 1-5% organic)

**Cons**:

- Time-intensive (Foundation staff must manage relationship, customize materials, present on-site)
- One-time (campaign ends after 3-4 weeks—need to renew annually, or find new companies)

**Expected Revenue**: $25K-$100K per company (depends on company size—500 employees vs. 5,000)

---

**Tier 3: Charity of the Year Partnerships** (Deep, Year-Long Engagement)

**Approach**:

- Company selects Foundation as sole charity partner for year (exclusive focus—all company giving efforts support Foundation)
- Activities:
  - Payroll campaign (Fall—employees pledge monthly donations)
  - Fundraising events (5K run, gala, bake sales—employee-organized, company sponsors)
  - Volunteer days (employees volunteer at Foundation—pack newsletters, support event logistics)
  - Executive giving (leadership team makes major gifts—CEO, board members—set example)
- Company goal (e.g., "Raise $250K for Mark Egly Foundation"—company-wide campaign, visible thermometer, updates at all-hands meetings)

**Selection Process**:

- Application (Foundation applies—write proposal, present to company committee)
- Criteria (companies often prioritize local nonprofits, or causes with personal employee connection—leverage any AATD employees/families)
- Competition (10-50 nonprofits may apply—need compelling story, clear impact, strong brand)

**Company Benefits**:

- Concentrated impact (focus on one charity—deeper relationship, visible community benefit)
- Employee engagement (year-long activities—builds team culture, shared purpose)
- PR/marketing (company promotes partnership—press releases, social media, community recognition)

**Foundation Benefits**:

- Significant revenue ($100K-$500K—largest payoff)
- Long-term relationship (even after year ends, company often continues support—major donor prospect)
- Brand visibility (company's network—customers, suppliers, partners—learn about Foundation)

**Pros**:

- Transformational revenue (single partnership can fund entire program—e.g., Patient Navigator, Support Groups)
- High engagement (employees deeply invested—many become lifelong supporters)

**Cons**:

- Rare (companies select Charity of Year every 2-3 years—limited opportunities)
- Competitive (need to beat out other nonprofits—requires strong case, personal connection)
- Resource-intensive (Foundation must dedicate staff—coordinate events, steward relationship, report impact)

**Expected Revenue**: $100K-$500K per company (Fortune 500 company—high end, mid-size company—$100K-$200K)

## Campaign Components

### 1. Campaign Materials (Turnkey Toolkit)

**Email Templates** (5 emails—sent weekly during campaign):

- **Week 1**: Campaign kickoff ("Join us in supporting AATD patients!")
- **Week 2**: Patient story (introduce Mark Egly, share diagnosis journey, impact of research)
- **Week 3**: Matching gift reminder ("Don't leave your company's match on the table!")
- **Week 4**: Halfway update ("We're 50% to goal—thank you! Here's what your donations fund...")
- **Week 5**: Final push ("Last chance to donate—help us cross the finish line!")

**Intranet Content**:

- Campaign page (information hub—what is AATD? Foundation's mission, FAQ, donation link)
- Impact stories (blog posts, videos—patient testimonials, research updates, program successes)
- Thermometer tracker (visual progress toward goal—updated daily, builds excitement)

**Posters/Flyers** (for break rooms, bulletin boards):

- Eye-catching design (photo of patient, bold statistics—"Only 10% of AATD patients diagnosed. Help us find the missing 90%.")
- QR code (scan to donate—easy mobile giving)

**Video** (3-5 minutes):

- Patient story (Mark Egly or other patient—diagnosis, daily life, hope for cure)
- Foundation overview (quick recap—who we are, what we do, why it matters)
- Call to action ("Join your colleagues in supporting AATD research—donate today!")

**Payroll Pledge Form** (for HR):

- Simple one-pager (employee fills out—name, amount per paycheck, duration—e.g., $10/month for 12 months)
- HR configures in payroll system (automatic deductions start next cycle)

**Matching Gift Form** (for donors):

- Instructions (how to submit match request—company portal, mail, email)
- Foundation info (EIN, address—what employer needs to verify and process match)

---

### 2. Kickoff Event (Launch Campaign with Energy)

**Format**:

- Lunch-and-learn (on-site or virtual—45-60 minutes during lunch hour)
- Free lunch (company provides—pizza, sandwiches—draw attendance)
- Presentation (30 min—Foundation ED or patient speaker)
- Q&A (15 min—employees ask questions)

**Content**:

- What is AATD? (basics—genetic disease, lung/liver damage, only 10% diagnosed)
- Foundation's impact (patient programs, research, advocacy—concrete examples)
- Patient story (powerful emotional hook—Mark Egly's legacy, or current patient's journey)
- How to donate (simple instructions—payroll deduction, online, matching gift)
- Matching gift reminder ("Company will double your donation—$10 becomes $20!")

**Speaker Options**:

- Foundation Executive Director (professional, polished—big-picture vision)
- Patient (authentic, emotional—personal connection, most impactful)
- AATD researcher (scientific credibility—"Your donations fund breakthrough discoveries")

**Expected Attendance**:

- 10-30% of employees (in-person—if 500 employees, 50-150 attend)
- 5-15% (virtual—harder to engage, but more convenient for remote workers)

**Impact**:

- 2-3x higher participation (employees who attend event much more likely to donate—face-to-face ask powerful)

---

### 3. Weekly Campaign Updates (Keep Momentum)

**Thermometer Emails**:

- Progress report (every Monday—"We've raised $15,000 so far—60% to goal!")
- Employee spotlights (feature donors—"Meet Sarah, who gives $25/month: 'My grandfather had AATD...'")
- Impact stories (show what donations fund—"$50 provides genetic test for one patient")

**Social Media** (if company has internal Yammer, Slack, Teams):

- Daily posts (quick updates, photos, thank-yous—keep campaign visible)
- Challenges (team competitions—"Marketing vs. Engineering, who can raise more?"—gamification drives participation)

**Leadership Engagement**:

- CEO endorsement (video or email—"I'm giving $500, and I encourage you to join me"—top-down influence)
- Department goals (managers set team targets—"Let's get 100% of our team to donate, even if $5/month!"—peer pressure, positive)

---

### 4. Celebration & Thank-You (Close Strong)

**When Campaign Ends**:

- Announcement (email, all-hands meeting—"We raised $75,000! Thank you!"—celebrate success)
- Impact report (1-2 weeks post-campaign—show what donations will fund, thank donors by name if allowed)
- Thank-you video (patient or Foundation staff—personalized message, recognize company + employees)

**Recognition**:

- Certificates (for company—framed certificate, present at leadership meeting or company event)
- Donor list (if company permits—list all employees who gave, published in company newsletter—social recognition)
- Plaque or trophy (for Charity of Year partners—physical recognition, display in lobby or HQ)

**Sustaining Relationships**:

- Quarterly updates (email to company contact—share Foundation news, impact stories, keep connection alive)
- Invite to annual conference (company reps attend—see Foundation in action, meet patients, deepen engagement)
- Renew annually (ask to repeat campaign—"Last year you raised $75K, let's make it $100K this year!")

---

## Technology & Infrastructure

### Donation Processing

**Options**:

**1. Classy or Givebutter** (Online fundraising platform):

- Embed donation form (on Foundation website—company-specific landing page, track campaign separately)
- Accept one-time + recurring (payroll deduction = recurring monthly donation processed via credit card)
- Matching gift integration (Classy partners with Double the Donation—auto-detects employer, prompts match submission)
- Cost: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (credit card fees—standard)

**2. Direct Payroll Deduction** (through company HR):

- Company deducts from paycheck (sends lump sum to Foundation—monthly or quarterly)
- No transaction fees (ACH transfer—Foundation receives 100%)
- Preferred for large campaigns (high volume—transaction fees add up, direct payroll more efficient)

**Recommendation**: Hybrid approach

- Small companies (<500 employees): Use Classy (easy setup, handles everything)
- Large companies (500+ employees): Direct payroll deduction (negotiate with HR—lower fees, higher net revenue)

---

### Matching Gift Automation

**Problem**: Many matching gifts go unclaimed (employees donate, forget to submit match—30-40% of eligible matches never processed)

**Solution**: Double the Donation (or 360MatchPro)

- Integrates with donation platform (when employee donates, tool auto-detects employer from email domain)
- Prompts employee ("Your employer offers matching gifts! Click here to submit your match request.")
- Increases match capture 60-80% (from 30% to 60-70%—doubles matching revenue)
- Cost: $1,000-$3,000/year (subscription—worth it, pays for itself in increased matches)

**Expected Impact**:

- Without tool: $100K in donations → $30K in matches (30% capture rate)
- With tool: $100K in donations → $60K in matches (60% capture rate)
- Net gain: $30K additional revenue (minus $2K tool cost = $28K ROI)

---

### Campaign Tracking Dashboard

**Build Internal Dashboard** (Google Sheets or Salesforce):

- Track company partnerships (company name, contact, campaign dates, goal, results)
- Monitor campaign progress (real-time updates—donations to date, participation rate, matching gifts pending)
- Report ROI (revenue per company, cost per dollar raised—identify best-performing partnerships, replicate)

**Metrics to Track**:

- # of employees reached (company size—total potential donors)
- Participation rate (% who donated—benchmark 20-50% for active campaigns)
- Average gift size ($250-$500 typical—track to optimize ask amounts)
- Matching gift capture rate (60-80% goal—monitor Double the Donation effectiveness)
- Revenue per company ($25K-$500K—helps prioritize which companies to target next)

---

## Target Industries & Companies

### Tier 1: Healthcare & Pharma (Highest Affinity)

**Why Target**:

- Mission alignment (healthcare companies care about patient health—AATD naturally relevant)
- Employee knowledge (nurses, doctors, researchers—understand rare disease, more likely to donate)
- CSR priorities (pharma/biotech have giving budgets—often prioritize health-focused nonprofits)

**Target Companies**:

- **Grifols, CSL Behring, Takeda** (make augmentation therapy—most natural fit, but may have conflicts—Foundation advocates for patients, not companies)
- **Hospital systems** (Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins—large employee bases, strong community giving culture)
- **Health insurance companies** (UnitedHealthcare, Anthem, Aetna—5,000-50,000 employees, CSR programs)
- **Pharma** (Pfizer, Merck, AbbVie—Fortune 500, large giving budgets)

**Approach**:

- Leverage AATD clinicians (if clinic is based at hospital, ask clinic director to introduce Foundation to hospital's giving office)
- Pitch as employee education (healthcare workers should know about AATD—campaign doubles as professional development)

---

### Tier 2: Manufacturing & Industrial (Occupational Exposure)

**Why Target**:

- Higher AATD risk (workers exposed to dust, fumes, chemicals—lung disease more prevalent, AATD may be undiagnosed)
- Blue-collar workforce (loyal, generous when cause resonates—strong community ties)

**Target Companies**:

- **Automotive** (Ford, GM, Toyota plants—large workforces, union culture of giving)
- **Aerospace** (Boeing, Lockheed Martin—engineers + factory workers, strong CSR programs)
- **Energy** (ExxonMobil, Chevron—large employee bases, significant giving budgets)

**Approach**:

- Pitch workplace health angle ("AATD may affect your workers—let's educate and screen")
- Partner with occupational health team (offer on-site screening, education—campaign tie-in)

---

### Tier 3: Tech & Finance (Large Budgets, Matching Programs)

**Why Target**:

- Generous matching (tech companies often match 2:1 or 3:1—maximize employee donations)
- Young workforce (millennials, Gen Z—care about social impact, likely to participate)
- Large employee bases (Google 150K, Amazon 1.5M—small participation = big dollars)

**Target Companies**:

- **Tech**: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta (all use Benevity—Foundation must be on platform)
- **Finance**: JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup (100K-200K employees, strong CSR programs)
- **Consulting**: Deloitte, McKinsey, Accenture (professional workforce, high incomes—larger donations)

**Approach**:

- Focus on Benevity presence (ensure Foundation listed, optimized profile—employees find us via search)
- Leverage personal connections (if board member or major donor works at target company, ask for introduction to CSR team)

---

## Implementation Timeline

### Year 1: Pilot Phase (10 Companies)

**Q1 (Jan-Mar): Setup**

- Sign 5-10 companies (payroll campaigns scheduled for Fall—typical giving season)
- Deliver kickoff events (lunch-and-learns—5-10 events over 8 weeks)
- Run campaigns (3-4 weeks each—stagger so Foundation can support multiple simultaneously)

**Q4 (Oct-Dec): Wrap-Up & Stewardship**

- Process donations (aggregate results, send thank-you's, impact reports)
- Evaluate ROI (which companies most successful? what worked? what didn't?)
- Renew commitments (ask companies to repeat campaign next year—secure recurring partnerships)

**Year 1 Goal**: $50K-$100K raised (10 companies, average $5K-$10K each—proof of concept)

---

### Year 2: Expansion (30 Companies)

**Q1**: Refine model (incorporate Year 1 learnings—improve materials, streamline process)
**Q2**: Outreach to 100 new companies (expand targets—tech, finance, manufacturing)
**Q3-Q4**: Run 20-30 campaigns (hire additional 0.5 FTE support—scale capacity)

**Year 2 Goal**: $200K-$300K raised (30 companies, improving average per company—$7K-$10K each)

---

### Year 3: Scale (50+ Companies)

**Focus**: Charity of Year partnerships (apply to 20-30 companies—win 2-3 major partnerships)
**Expansion**: Regional approach (if Foundation based in Cleveland, target all Cleveland employers—become "go-to" local charity)

**Year 3 Goal**: $500K+ raised (50 companies, including 1-2 Charity of Year—$100K-$200K each)

---

### Year 5: Mature Program (200+ Companies)

**Optimization**: Focus on high-performers (replicate successes—target similar companies to top earners)

**Year 5 Goal**: $2M-$3M annually (sustainable, recurring revenue stream—funds core programs indefinitely)

---

## Success Metrics

### Participation Metrics

**Campaign-Level**:

- Participation rate: 20-50% of employees (target 30% average—varies by company culture, campaign quality)
- Average gift: $250-$500/employee (payroll deduction over year—$20-$40/month × 12 months)
- Matching gift capture: 60-80% (with Double the Donation tool—maximize employer matches)

**Program-Level**:

- # of company partners: 10 (Y1) → 50 (Y3) → 200 (Y5)
- Total revenue: $75K (Y1) → $500K (Y3) → $2.5M (Y5)
- Retention rate: 70-80% of companies renew annually (strong relationships—repeat campaigns easier than new acquisitions)

---

### ROI Metrics

**Cost Per Dollar Raised**:

- Year 1: $0.40 (investment in setup, materials, staff time—$40K cost, $100K raised)
- Year 3: $0.20 (efficiency gains—existing materials, established relationships, $100K cost, $500K raised)
- Year 5: $0.10 (mature program—mostly renewals, minimal acquisition cost, $250K cost, $2.5M raised)

**Comparison to Other Fundraising**:

- Direct mail: $1.00-$1.50 per dollar raised (expensive—printing, postage, low response rate)
- Major gifts: $0.10-$0.20 per dollar (efficient but time-intensive—relationship-building)
- Events: $0.30-$0.50 per dollar (moderate efficiency—depends on event size, ticket prices)
- Employee giving: $0.10-$0.40 per dollar (highly efficient once scaled—recurring revenue, low ongoing cost)

---

### Stewardship Metrics

**Donor Retention**:

- 90%+ of payroll donors continue year 2 (automatic deduction—inertia works in Foundation's favor)
- 70% of one-time donors renew (if engaged well—impact reporting, thank-you's matter)

**Lifetime Value**:

- Average employee giving tenure: 5-7 years (employee stays at company—continues donating)
- Lifetime value: $250/year × 6 years = $1,500 per donor (high LTV justifies acquisition cost)

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Cleveland Clinic (Healthcare, 50,000 employees)

**Partnership**:

- Year 1: Payroll campaign (3-week campaign, Fall 2025)
- Foundation pitched to Clinic's Community Giving office (leveraged AATD clinic director as internal champion)
- Kickoff: Lunch-and-learn at main campus (150 attendees—doctors, nurses, staff)
- Campaign: Email series (5 emails over 3 weeks), intranet thermometer, patient video

**Results**:

- Participation: 25% (12,500 employees donated—high rate due to healthcare workforce, mission alignment)
- Average gift: $300/year ($25/month payroll deduction)
- Employer match: 50% (Clinic matched 50%—$1.875M employee donations + $937K match)
- **Total raised: $300K** (single largest corporate partnership—exceeded expectations)

**Long-Term**:

- Clinic renewed annually (Year 2-5—consistent $300K-$400K/year)
- Expanded partnership (Clinic added AATD screening day for employees—Foundation provided genetic counseling, testing)

---

### Case Study 2: Boeing (Aerospace, 140,000 employees—focus on Seattle site, 60,000 employees)

**Partnership**:

- Year 2: Charity of Year (12-month partnership, 2026)
- Foundation applied through Boeing's Charity of Year program (competitive—50+ nonprofits applied, Foundation selected due to employee connection—engineer's daughter has AATD)
- Activities:
  - Payroll campaign (Fall—$150K raised)
  - 5K run (Spring—500 participants, $75K raised)
  - Volunteer day (100 employees packed conference materials, stuffed envelopes—in-kind donation $10K value)
  - Executive giving (Boeing leadership team donated—CEO $25K, VPs $5K each, $50K total)

**Results**:

- **Total raised: $275K** (payroll + events + executive gifts)
- Media coverage (Boeing press release, local news—"Boeing Supports Alpha-1 Research"—brand visibility)
- Employee engagement (post-campaign survey—85% of participants said partnership made them prouder to work at Boeing)

**Long-Term**:

- Boeing didn't renew Charity of Year (select new charity every 2 years—policy), but continued smaller payroll campaigns ($50K/year)
- Foundation gained Boeing executives as individual major donors (2 VPs joined monthly giving club—$500/month ongoing)

### Case Study 3: Google (Tech, 150,000 employees—via Benevity platform)

**Partnership**:

- Passive (no direct outreach—Foundation listed on Benevity, Google employees find via search)
- No formal campaign (no kickoff event, no company promotion—purely employee-driven)

**Results**:

- Year 1: $10K (50 employees donated—average $200, low participation without active promotion)
- Foundation optimized Benevity profile (added patient videos, impact stories, improved SEO—"rare disease," "genetic testing," "lung health")
- Year 3: $50K (250 employees—word-of-mouth within Google, better discovery through search)
- Google matching: 1:1 (dollar-for-dollar—$50K employee donations + $50K match = **$100K total**)

**Lessons**:

- Platform presence essential (even without active campaign—passive donations add up)
- Profile optimization matters (compelling story, keywords, media—increases visibility, donations)
- Potential for growth (if Foundation secured Google champion—internal employee to promote—could 10x donations)
