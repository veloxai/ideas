## Partnership Philosophy

### Core Principle: Aligned Interests, Maintained Independence

**The Opportunity**:

- Pharma companies need patient organizations (market access, clinical trial recruitment, disease awareness—Foundation has patients, credibility, reach)
- Foundation needs pharma (funding for programs, research collaboration, access to therapies—companies have capital, R&D capacity)

**The Challenge**:

- Perceived conflicts (patients worry Foundation becomes "pharma puppet"—lose trust if seen as industry-funded)
- Actual conflicts (what if Foundation must advocate against company interest?—e.g., drug pricing, insurance coverage)

**Foundation's Approach**:

- ✅ **Strategic partnerships** (not transactional—long-term relationships with aligned companies)
- ✅ **Transparent funding** (disclose all pharma support—donors know who funds what)
- ✅ **Diversified revenue** (pharma = 20-30% of budget max—never over-reliant on single source)
- ✅ **Editorial independence** (companies fund programs, but Foundation controls content—no veto power on advocacy, education)
- ✅ **Patient-first decisions** (if company interests diverge from patient interests—Foundation always sides with patients)

### Why Pharma Companies Partner with Patient Organizations

**Market Access & Awareness**:

- Increase diagnosis rates (only 10% of AATD patients diagnosed—companies need more patients identified to expand market)
- Educate physicians (primary care doctors don't test for AATD—Foundation educates, testing increases, prescriptions increase)
- Patient support programs (help patients access therapy—Foundation navigation reduces abandonment, improves adherence)

**Clinical Trial Recruitment**:

- Faster enrollment (Foundation registry = trial-ready patients—cut recruitment time from 2 years to 6 months)
- Better retention (Foundation support = lower dropout—complete datasets, stronger evidence)

**Corporate Social Responsibility**:

- Genuine mission alignment (pharma employees want to help patients—Foundation partnership satisfies CSR goals)
- Reputation management (supporting patient advocacy = positive brand—offsets negative perceptions of "greedy pharma")

**Regulatory & Payer Relations**:

- Patient voice (FDA, CMS listen to patients—Foundation testifies on company's behalf if therapy is effective)
- Real-world evidence (Foundation registry data supplements clinical trials—payers more likely to cover)

- **Opportunity**: Develop rapid AAT testing device (see quick AAT testing document)
- **Partnership**: Co-development + licensing (Foundation funds early research [$1M-$3M], companies commercialize, Foundation receives royalties)

---

## Partnership Models

### Model 1: Unrestricted Educational Grant (Preferred)

**Structure**:

- Company provides grant to Foundation (e.g., $500K/year)
- **Unrestricted** (Foundation decides how to use funds—no strings attached)
- Purpose: Support mission (patient education, support programs, conferences—broad)

**Benefits to Foundation**:

- ✅ Maximum flexibility (spend on highest priorities—staff, programs, research)
- ✅ Editorial independence (company cannot dictate content—Foundation controls messaging)
- ✅ Simple administration (one check, no reporting burden—minimal overhead)

**Benefits to Company**:

- ✅ Goodwill (supports patient community—CSR, brand reputation)
- ✅ Awareness (Foundation's work increases diagnosis—expands market)
- ✅ Tax deduction (charitable contribution—reduces tax burden)

**Terms**:

- Annual renewal (1-year grant, renew each year—gives both sides flexibility)
- Acknowledgment (Foundation lists company as "Platinum Sponsor"—website, materials, events, no endorsement of products)
- Transparency (Foundation discloses grant publicly—Annual Report, website, Form 990)

**Example**:

- Grifols provides $750K unrestricted grant (2026)
- Foundation uses funds: $300K for Support Group program, $200K for Annual Conference, $150K for Patient Navigation, $100K for general operations
- Foundation acknowledges Grifols: Website ("Platinum Sponsor"), conference program ("Thank you to Grifols for supporting patient programs"), no product endorsement
- Grifols benefits: 2,000 patients attend Foundation programs (learn about AATD, many start augmentation), Grifols brand visible (top-of-mind when patients choose therapy), goodwill in community

---

### Model 2: Program-Specific Sponsorship

**Structure**:

- Company sponsors specific Foundation program (e.g., "Breathe Easy Walk, presented by CSL Behring")
- Grant restricted to that program (Foundation must use funds for designated purpose—e.g., Walk expenses)

**Benefits to Foundation**:

- ✅ Larger sponsorships (companies more comfortable funding visible programs—easier to justify internally)
- ✅ Secure program funding (Walk costs covered—Foundation can focus other funds on programs without corporate appeal)

**Benefits to Company**:

- ✅ Brand visibility (logo on T-shirts, banners, website—direct association with patient event)
- ✅ Employee engagement (company sends employee teams to Walk—team-building, CSR)

**Terms**:

- Multi-year commitment (3-year agreement—predictable for both sides)
- Recognition levels (Presenting $50K, Gold $25K, Silver $10K—tiered benefits)
- No editorial control (company sponsors event, but Foundation controls content—no product promotion at event)

**Example**:

- CSL Behring sponsors Breathe Easy Walk ($50K/year, 3 years = $150K)
- Benefits: Logo on T-shirts (1,000 walkers), banner at event, booth at health fair, mentioned in remarks, social media recognition
- CSL Behring sends 50-employee team (company pays registration $2,500, employees fundraise $10K—total CSL contribution $62.5K)
- Foundation: Walk expenses covered ($50K from sponsorship + $12.5K additional from CSL team), net profit to mission

---

### Model 3: Research Collaboration

**Structure**:

- Company co-funds research with Foundation (e.g., Foundation + Grifols each contribute $250K to real-world outcomes study)
- Shared data (both parties access results—Foundation for patient benefit, company for regulatory/payer submissions)

**Benefits to Foundation**:

- ✅ Leverage funding (Foundation's $250K becomes $500K study—more impact per dollar)
- ✅ Access to company data (companies have proprietary data—Foundation gains insights)

**Benefits to Company**:

- ✅ Real-world evidence (registry data supplements clinical trials—supports FDA, payer submissions)
- ✅ Academic credibility (Foundation partnership = neutral, trusted data—not company-sponsored study)

**Terms**:

- Co-ownership of data (both can publish—academic freedom preserved)
- Publication approval (both parties review manuscripts—ensure accuracy, not to block publication)
- IP rights (if discovery leads to patent—negotiate split, usually 50/50 or Foundation gets rights)

**Example**:

- Takeda + Foundation co-fund study: "Real-World Outcomes of Augmentation Therapy" ($500K, 2 years, 500 patients from Foundation registry)
- Study shows augmentation slows FEV1 decline, reduces exacerbations, improves QOL (confirms clinical trial data in real-world setting)
- Published in AJRCCM (peer-reviewed, credible—both Foundation and Takeda co-authors)
- Takeda uses data for payer negotiations ("Real-world study confirms therapy works"—insurance coverage improves)
- Foundation uses data for patient education ("Evidence shows augmentation helps"—more patients start therapy)

---

### Model 4: Patient Assistance Fund

**Structure**:

- Company funds Foundation's patient assistance program (e.g., Grifols provides $3M/year for co-pay assistance)
- Foundation administers (processes applications, distributes funds—company not involved in individual decisions)

**Benefits to Foundation**:

- ✅ Help uninsured/underinsured patients (co-pays $5K-$20K/year—barrier to therapy, Foundation removes barrier)
- ✅ No favoritism (Foundation can assist patients on any brand—Grifols, CSL, Takeda, maintains neutrality)

**Benefits to Company**:

- ✅ Market access (patients who couldn't afford therapy now can—sales increase)
- ✅ Brand loyalty (patients remember "Grifols helped me access therapy"—positive association)
- ✅ Regulatory compliance (independent Foundation administers—avoids anti-kickback concerns)

**Terms**:

- Brand-neutral (Foundation can assist patients on any augmentation brand—not just Grifols, avoids conflict)
- Needs-based (Foundation sets eligibility criteria—income, insurance status, not company)
- Transparency (Foundation reports aggregate data—# assisted, $ distributed, not individual patient identities)

**Example**:

- Grifols funds Foundation's Co-Pay Assistance Fund ($3M/year)
- Foundation assists 300 patients/year ($10K average co-pay support)
- Patients on Prolastin (Grifols): 150 (50%)
- Patients on Zemaira (CSL): 90 (30%)
- Patients on Glassia (Takeda): 60 (20%)
- Result: Grifols helped all patients (including competitors' patients—demonstrates industry leadership), sales increase for all brands (patients who couldn't afford therapy now adherent), Foundation fulfills mission (remove financial barriers)

- Diagnostics: $200K-$500K (Invitae, Abbott—testing programs, device development)
- **Total**: $2.2M-$3.5M (28-35% of $8M-$10M budget)

**Diversification Maintained**: Pharma never exceeds 35% of budget (65%+ from individuals, foundations, events—protects independence)

---

### Pharma Revenue by Type

**Year 5 Target Breakdown** ($2.5M total pharma revenue):

- Unrestricted grants: $1M (40%—maximum flexibility)
- Program sponsorships: $600K (24%—events, patient services)
- Research collaboration: $500K (20%—co-funded studies)
- Patient assistance: $400K (16%—co-pay support, administered by Foundation)

---

## Maintaining Independence

### Transparency Policy

**Public Disclosure**:

- Annual Report lists all pharma donors ($10K+ disclosed—company name, amount, purpose)
- Website "Our Supporters" page (updated quarterly—pharma prominently disclosed)
- Form 990 (IRS filing public—pharma grants visible to anyone)

**Why Transparency Matters**:

- Trust (patients know who funds Foundation—no hidden conflicts)
- Accountability (public scrutiny ensures Foundation stays patient-focused—can't become pharma puppet)

---

### Editorial Independence

**Non-Negotiable Rules**:

1. **No product endorsements** (Foundation never says "Use Prolastin" or "Zemaira is best"—remains brand-neutral)
2. **No veto power** (pharma cannot block Foundation content—even if critical of company)
3. **Patient-first messaging** (Foundation advocates for patients—even if conflicts with company interest, e.g., drug pricing)

**Examples in Practice**:

**Scenario 1: Drug Pricing Advocacy**

- Foundation advocates for lower augmentation therapy costs (testifies to Congress—"$150K/year is unaffordable")
- Grifols/CSL/Takeda may disagree (pricing pressure threatens profits)
- **Foundation's Stance**: Advocate anyway (patient interest > company interest—companies can discontinue grant if they want, but Foundation won't be silenced)

**Scenario 2: Comparative Effectiveness**

- Foundation publishes registry study: "All augmentation brands equally effective" (no significant difference in outcomes)
- Grifols (largest funder) may prefer Foundation promote Prolastin as "superior" (justify premium price)
- **Foundation's Stance**: Publish truth (data shows no difference—Foundation reports accurately, helps patients make informed decisions)

**Scenario 3: Alternative Therapy Promotion**

- Foundation promotes gene therapy (future alternative to augmentation—threatens augmentation market)
- Augmentation manufacturers may want Foundation to downplay gene therapy (protect current revenue)
- **Foundation's Stance**: Promote gene therapy (patient benefit—potential cure vs. lifelong infusions, Foundation prioritizes best outcome for patients)

---

### Diversified Revenue

**Why It Matters**:

- Dependence = vulnerability (if pharma = 80% of budget, companies control Foundation—threaten to withdraw funding, Foundation must comply)
- Diversification = independence (if pharma = 30%, losing one company = manageable—Foundation negotiates from strength, not desperation)

**Foundation's Target**:

- Individuals: 40-50% of revenue (major gifts, mid-level, annual fund—broad base)
- Events: 15-20% (Walk, Gala, Virtual—community engagement)
- Foundations/grants: 10-15% (NIH, private foundations—non-pharma)
- Pharma/corporate: 20-30% (never exceed 30%—maintain independence)
- Other: 5-10% (planned giving, endowment, miscellaneous)

---

## Contract Negotiation Guidelines

### Key Terms to Negotiate

**1. Grant Amount & Duration**

- **Ask high** (companies have budget—Foundation should request top tier)
- **Multi-year preferred** (3-year commitment—predictable revenue, reduces annual fundraising burden)
- **Escalation clause** (2-3% annual increase—keeps pace with inflation)

**Example Term**: "$500K/year for 3 years, with 3% escalation in Years 2-3 ($500K Y1, $515K Y2, $530K Y3)"

---

**2. Restriction Level**

- **Unrestricted strongly preferred** (maximum flexibility—Foundation decides use)
- **If restricted, broad purpose** (e.g., "patient education" vs. "travel to conferences"—avoid overly narrow restrictions)
- **Overhead allocation** (15% of grant can go to admin/fundraising—covers Foundation's true costs)

**Example Term**: "Unrestricted grant for general support of patient programs, with up to 15% allocated to administrative costs."

---

**3. Recognition vs. Endorsement**

- **Recognition acceptable** (Foundation acknowledges grant—"Thank you to [Company]," logo on website, event materials)
- **Endorsement prohibited** (Foundation never says "We recommend [Company's drug]"—maintains neutrality)

**Example Term**: "Foundation will acknowledge [Company] as Platinum Sponsor on website, in Annual Report, and at events. Foundation will not endorse, recommend, or promote [Company's] products."

---

**4. Publication & Data Rights**

- **Foundation owns data** (if research funded—Foundation controls publication, company cannot block)
- **Company review allowed** (company can review manuscripts—fact-check, ensure accuracy, not to suppress unfavorable results)
- **IP split if applicable** (if research leads to patent—negotiate upfront, typically 50/50 or Foundation-majority)

**Example Term**: "Foundation retains ownership of all data and right to publish results. [Company] may review manuscripts for factual accuracy, with 30 days' notice. [Company] may not delay or block publication based on unfavorable results."

---

**5. Termination Clause**

- **Mutual termination** (either party can exit with 90 days' notice—protects both)
- **No clawback** (company cannot demand refund if relationship ends—Foundation can plan with confidence)

**Example Term**: "Either party may terminate this agreement with 90 days' written notice. Funds already disbursed to Foundation are non-refundable."

---

### Red Flags (Deal-Breakers)

**❌ Exclusive relationship** ("Foundation cannot accept grants from competing companies"—limits diversification, unacceptable)

**❌ Product endorsement required** ("Foundation must promote [Drug] in patient materials"—violates neutrality, unacceptable)

**❌ Veto power over content** ("Company approves all Foundation content before publication"—violates editorial independence, unacceptable)

**❌ Contingent on sales** ("Grant paid only if [Drug] sales increase"—creates conflict of interest, unacceptable)

**❌ Patient data access** ("Company gets identifiable patient data from registry"—violates privacy, unacceptable, de-identified aggregate data only)

---

## Partnership Activation

### Beyond the Check: Maximizing Partnership Value

**Joint Activities** (Enhance relationship beyond grant):

**1. Patient Education Webinars** (Co-host with company):

- Foundation invites patients (500-1,000 attendees—Foundation's reach)
- Company provides speaker (medical science liaison—explain therapy, answer questions)
- **Value to Foundation**: Expert content (company employees are experts—save Foundation from hiring speaker)
- **Value to Company**: Direct patient engagement (brand visibility, educate patients about therapy options)
- **Boundaries**: No product promotion (education only—"Here's how augmentation therapy works," not "Buy Prolastin")

---

**2. Booth at Foundation Events**:

- Company sponsors Walk or Conference (booth in health fair, exhibit hall)
- Company staff distribute materials (educational brochures, not sales pitches—AATD info, testing resources)
- **Value to Foundation**: Enhanced event (more exhibitors = better experience for attendees)
- **Value to Company**: Face-to-face with patients (build relationships, answer questions, brand presence)
- **Boundaries**: No hard sell (education/support focus—not "Switch to our brand," patients turned off by sales tactics)

---

**3. Joint Research Proposals**:

- Foundation + company submit joint grant applications (to NIH, foundations—co-applicants)
- Leverage both parties' strengths (Foundation = patient access, company = scientific expertise)
- **Value to Foundation**: Larger grants (NIH more likely to fund if industry partner—signals feasibility)
- **Value to Company**: Academic credibility (Foundation collaboration = neutral researcher, not commercial study)

---

**4. Advisory Board Participation**:

- Company representative sits on Foundation's Scientific Advisory Board (provide industry perspective—what's in pipeline? what's feasible?)
- **Value to Foundation**: Industry insights (understand what companies are developing—shape Foundation research priorities)
- **Value to Company**: Shape research agenda (influence what Foundation funds—align with company interests, but Foundation maintains veto)
- **Boundaries**: Non-voting seat (advisory only—company doesn't control funding decisions)

---

## Success Metrics

- Clinical trials accelerated: 1 (Y1) → 5 (Y5—pharma + Foundation collaborations)

---

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks & Mitigation Strategies

**Risk 1: Perceived Conflict of Interest**

- **Scenario**: Patients believe Foundation is "pharma-funded puppet," lose trust
- **Mitigation**:
  - Transparency (disclose all pharma funding—Annual Report, website, no secrets)
  - Diversified revenue (pharma <35%—demonstrate independence)
  - Patient advisory board (patients review pharma partnerships—veto if concern)

---

**Risk 2: Actual Conflict of Interest**

- **Scenario**: Foundation must advocate against pharma interest (e.g., drug pricing), company withdraws funding, budget crisis
- **Mitigation**:
  - Diversified revenue (losing one company = 5-10% of budget—painful but manageable)
  - Reserve fund (6 months operating expenses saved—bridge gap if funding lost)
  - Transparent terms (contracts allow termination—both parties know risks upfront)

---

**Risk 3: Mission Drift**

- **Scenario**: Foundation prioritizes pharma-friendly activities (education, support) over uncomfortable advocacy (pricing, access—neglect advocacy to avoid upsetting funders)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Board oversight (Board annually reviews advocacy agenda—ensure Foundation speaks up)
  - Patient input (patients identify Foundation's advocacy priorities—not pharma)
  - Public commitments (Foundation publicly commits to specific advocacy goals—e.g., "Reduce augmentation costs"—accountability)

---

**Risk 4: Regulatory Scrutiny**

- **Scenario**: IRS or state AG investigates Foundation-pharma relationship (concerned Foundation is marketing arm of company, not true charity)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Legal review (contracts reviewed by nonprofit attorney—ensure compliance)
  - Arm's length transactions (fair market value for services—no sweetheart deals)
  - Document charitable purpose (all pharma grants support tax-exempt mission—patient education, research, not product promotion)

---
