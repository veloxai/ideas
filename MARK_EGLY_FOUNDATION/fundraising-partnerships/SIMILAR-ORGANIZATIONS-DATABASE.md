## Benchmarking Overview

### Why Benchmark?

**Learn from Success**:

- Avoid reinventing wheel (proven models exist—adapt, don't start from scratch)
- Accelerate growth (compress 20-year learning curve into 5 years—study what works)
- Set realistic goals (understand what's achievable—revenue, programs, timeline)
- Identify gaps (see what we're missing—programs, partnerships, fundraising strategies)

**Who to Study**:

- **Tier 1**: Aspirational models (Michael J. Fox, CF Foundation—30+ years, $100M+ budgets, massive impact)
- **Tier 2**: Similar-size peers (PH Association, LAM Foundation—$5M-$20M budgets, rare diseases, 10-20 years old)
- **Tier 3**: Adjacent space (American Lung Association, COPD Foundation—lung disease focus, different scale/model)

- Research: $2M-$3M/year (major funder—on par with NIH for AATD)
- Advocacy: Newborn screening in 25+ states (policy wins—impact millions)
- Patient services: 200+ support groups, patient navigation in all 50 states, annual conference 1,000+ attendees

**Funding Model**:

- Individuals: $5M (major gifts, planned giving—loyal donor base)
- Pharma: $3M (Grifols, CSL, Takeda partnerships—co-invest in programs, research)
- Events: $2M (Walk, Gala, Virtual—mature event portfolio)
- Foundations: $1M (NIH, private foundations—grants)
- Royalties/IP: $1M-$3M (if venture philanthropy pays off—gene therapy, diagnostics)

## Strategic Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Adopt Milestone-Based Research Funding (MJF Model)

**Action**: Structure grants with performance milestones (Year 1: preliminary data, Year 2: publication, Year 3: clinical trial)
**Timeline**: Implement Year 2 (when research program launches)
**Investment**: No additional cost (just structure of existing research budget)
**Impact**: Faster research progress (accountability drives results)

---

### Recommendation 2: Build Patient Registry (CF/PHA Model)

**Action**: Launch AATD Patient Registry (see separate document—10,000-patient target by Year 10)
**Timeline**: Year 2-3 launch, 5-year growth plan
**Investment**: $500K setup + $200K/year operations
**Impact**: Accelerate clinical trials (pharma partnerships), natural history data (guide treatment), donor engagement (tangible asset)

---

### Recommendation 3: Pursue Venture Philanthropy (CF Model)

**Action**: Invest $2M-$5M in AATD gene therapy startup (negotiate equity + royalties)
**Timeline**: Year 5-7 (when Foundation has capital, gene therapy nearing approval)
**Investment**: $2M-$5M (high-risk capital—may lose all, or may generate CF-level returns)
**Impact**: If successful, perpetual funding (royalties sustain Foundation forever—worth the risk)

---

### Recommendation 4: Establish Pharma Partnerships (PHA Model)

**Action**: Formalize relationships with Grifols, CSL Behring, Takeda (augmentation manufacturers)
**Timeline**: Year 1-2 (early priority—partnerships take time to develop)
**Investment**: Staff time (BD efforts—no cash outlay)
**Impact**: $1M-$3M/year by Year 5 (corporate grants, research co-funding, event sponsorships)

---

### Recommendation 5: Stay Lean (LAM Model)

**Action**: Cap staff at 35-40 FTEs by Year 10 (resist urge to over-hire—efficiency matters)
**Timeline**: Ongoing discipline
**Investment**: N/A (cost savings—lower overhead)
**Impact**: 15-20% overhead ratio (donor confidence—"My donation goes to patients, not bureaucracy")
