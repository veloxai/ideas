## The Diagnosis Crisis

### Only 10% of AATD Patients Are Diagnosed

**The Numbers**:

- **Estimated US AATD patients**: 100,000-200,000 (based on carrier frequency + population genetics)
- **Actually diagnosed**: 10,000-20,000 (10% detection rate—90% undiagnosed)
- **Receiving treatment**: 5,000-8,000 (50-80% of diagnosed—many diagnosed but not treated)

**Why So Few Diagnosed?**:

1. **Physicians don't test** (primary care doctors don't think of AATD—rare disease, not on radar)
2. **Misdiagnosed as COPD/asthma** (symptoms identical—patients treated for "regular" COPD, underlying genetic cause missed)
3. **Testing barriers** (requires blood draw + send to lab—patients/doctors skip due to hassle)
4. **Lack of awareness** (patients don't know AATD exists—never ask to be tested)

---

### The Opportunity: Genetic Testing Can 10x Diagnosis Rates

**Traditional Testing** (current state):

- Patient sees pulmonologist for COPD symptoms
- Doctor orders AAT level blood test (measures protein level—if low, suggests AATD)
- If low, doctor orders genetic test (confirms which AATD mutations—Pi*ZZ, Pi*SZ, etc.)
- **Bottleneck**: Requires symptomatic patient + aware physician (most patients/doctors never reach this point)

**Genetic-First Approach** (new paradigm):

- Patient takes genetic test for ANY reason (ancestry, health screening, cancer risk—23andMe, Invitae, etc.)
- Test includes SERPINA1 gene (AAT gene—AATD mutations visible in genetic data)
- If AATD mutations detected, patient notified + referred to specialist
- **Advantage**: Catches patients BEFORE symptoms (test for other reasons, AATD found incidentally—10x-100x more patients identified)

**Potential Impact**:

- 30 million Americans have taken 23andMe test (if AATD check included—could identify 30,000-60,000 undiagnosed patients overnight)
- 5 million clinical genetic tests ordered annually (cancer, prenatal, rare disease—if AATD checked on all—identify 5,000-10,000 new patients/year)

**This is the Foundation's #1 diagnosis strategy.**

## Partnership Opportunities

### Three Partnership Tracks

**Track 1: Consumer Genomics Companies** (23andMe, AncestryDNA)

- **Goal**: Mine existing databases (identify AATD patients who already tested, notify them)
- **Target companies**: 23andMe (30M customers), AncestryDNA (20M), MyHeritage (5M)
- **Impact**: 55,000 databases = 5,500-11,000 AATD patients (1 in 5,000 - 1 in 10,000 prevalence)—largest untapped reservoir

---

**Track 2: Clinical Genetic Testing Companies** (Invitae, GeneDx, Myriad)

- **Goal**: Add AATD to standard testing panels (any patient getting genetic test = automatically screened for AATD)
- **Target companies**: Invitae (5M tests/year), GeneDx (rare disease focus), Myriad (hereditary cancer)
- **Impact**: 5M tests/year × 0.1% AATD prevalence = 5,000 new diagnoses/year

---

**Track 3: Physician-Ordered Diagnostic Labs** (Quest, LabCorp, Mayo)

- **Goal**: Simplify AATD testing for physicians (make ordering easy—single checkbox, insurance-covered)
- **Target companies**: Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, Mayo Medical Labs
- **Impact**: 100,000 physicians order tests more frequently (simple, affordable—double testing rate = 2,000-5,000 new diagnoses/year)

---

## Target Companies

### Tier 1: Consumer Genomics (Highest Impact)

**1. 23andMe**

- **Database**: 30 million customers (largest consumer genomics database—tested for ancestry, health reports)
- **Current AATD Coverage**: PARTIAL (23andMe health reports include "Alpha-1 Carrier Status" for 23andMe+ subscribers—identifies carriers [Pi*MZ, Pi*MS], but not comprehensive [misses many mutations])
- **Opportunity**: COMPREHENSIVE AATD CHECK (scan for all SERPINA1 mutations—Pi*ZZ, Pi*SZ, rare variants, not just common carriers)

**Partnership Approach**:

1. **Data mining retrospective** (23andMe analyzes existing 30M customer data for AATD mutations—estimate 30,000-60,000 AATD patients in database)
2. **Customer notification** (23andMe emails customers with AATD mutations—"Your genetic data shows Alpha-1, here's what it means," link to Foundation resources)
3. **Clinical confirmation** (Foundation coordinates follow-up testing—phenotype [AAT level] + genotype confirmation, connect to specialist)
4. **Ongoing prospective** (all new 23andMe customers automatically checked for AATD—embedded in health reports)

**Business Model**:

- **For 23andMe**: Differentiator (only consumer test that comprehensively checks AATD—attracts customers with family history, lung disease), Value-add to subscribers (23andMe+ health reports justify $199/year—AATD check adds value)
- **For Foundation**: Data goldmine (identify tens of thousands undiagnosed—largest single diagnosis source), Credibility (partner with leading consumer genomics company—raises Foundation profile)

**Revenue Potential for Foundation**:

- 23andMe pays Foundation consulting fee: $100K-$300K/year (Foundation provides clinical expertise—interpretation guidelines, patient resources)
- Foundation offers clinical confirmation testing: $200-$500/patient × 5,000 patients/year = $1M-$2.5M (Foundation subsidizes for uninsured—net cost, but worth it for diagnosis impact)

---

**2. AncestryDNA**

- **Database**: 20 million customers (second-largest consumer genomics—ancestry focus, not health reports currently)
- **Current AATD Coverage**: NONE (AncestryDNA ancestry-only—doesn't provide health reports, genetic data not interpreted for disease risk)
- **Opportunity**: HEALTH EXPANSION (AncestryDNA exploring health reports—AATD could be pilot condition)

**Partnership Approach**:

1. **Pilot AATD health report** (Foundation + AncestryDNA co-develop first health report—"Your Alpha-1 Status," test market before full health platform)
2. **Cross-sell to existing customers** (20M customers can unlock AATD report for $49—AncestryDNA revenue, Foundation gains diagnoses)

**Business Model**:

- **For AncestryDNA**: Health entry (AATD = low-risk pilot [not cancer/Alzheimer's—less controversy], proven demand [100K AATD families want answers], test waters for broader health expansion)
- **For Foundation**: Second-largest database (20M customers—potential 20,000-40,000 AATD patients)

---

**3. MyHeritage DNA, LivingDNA (Tier 3 Consumer)**

- **Databases**: 5M customers (MyHeritage), 1M (LivingDNA)—smaller but still valuable
- **Approach**: Same as 23andMe/Ancestry (data mining + ongoing prospective testing)
- **Impact**: 6M databases = 600-1,200 AATD patients

---

### Tier 2: Clinical Genetic Testing (High Impact, Medical Setting)

**4. Invitae**

- **Testing Volume**: 5 million clinical tests/year (physician-ordered—cancer, prenatal, rare disease panels)
- **Current AATD Coverage**: PARTIAL (Invitae's "Pulmonary Panel" includes SERPINA1—but only ordered for symptomatic patients, not broad)
- **Opportunity**: ADD AATD TO ALL PANELS (cancer panel, cardiac panel, prenatal—any test includes SERPINA1 check)

**Partnership Approach**:

1. **Expand SERPINA1 coverage** (add to all multi-gene panels—~100 genes per panel, adding SERPINA1 = marginal cost [already sequencing exome, just report another gene])
2. **Clinical interpretation** (Foundation provides interpretation guidelines—help physicians understand results, recommendations)
3. **Patient follow-up** (Invitae refers AATD-positive patients to Foundation—connect to care, enroll in registry)

**Business Model**:

- **For Invitae**: Comprehensive testing (market as "most complete genetic test"—includes AATD, competitors may not), Partnership differentiation (only lab partnered with AATD Foundation—credibility)
- **For Foundation**: 5M tests/year × 0.1% = 5,000 new diagnoses/year (largest annual diagnosis source)

**Cost**:

- Foundation pays Invitae: $0 (SERPINA1 already in many panels—no additional cost to add to all panels)
- Foundation provides interpretation support: $100K-$200K/year (staff time—genetic counselor, educational materials)

---

**5. GeneDx (Rare Disease Focus)**

- **Testing Volume**: 500,000 tests/year (smaller than Invitae, but rare disease specialty—higher AATD hit rate)
- **Opportunity**: REFLEX TESTING (if patient has unexplained liver disease or early COPD—automatically add AATD test without physician re-ordering)

**Partnership Approach**:

- GeneDx builds AATD into reflex protocol (liver panel ordered + elevated transaminases + age <50 = automatic SERPINA1 check)
- Foundation provides clinical decision support (which scenarios warrant AATD testing—codify into GeneDx ordering system)

---

**6. Myriad Genetics (Cancer Focus)**

- **Testing Volume**: 1 million tests/year (hereditary cancer—BRCA, Lynch, etc.)
- **Opportunity**: INCIDENTAL FINDING (cancer panel patients = exome sequenced, AATD visible as incidental finding)

**Partnership Approach**:

- Myriad reports AATD as "additional finding" (currently report secondary findings per ACMG guidelines [heart, cancer]—add AATD to list)
- Foundation becomes referral partner (Myriad patients with AATD → Foundation connects to pulmonologist)

---

### Tier 3: Diagnostic Labs (Clinical Access)

**7. Quest Diagnostics**

- **Market Position**: Largest US lab (2,500 patient service centers, 150M patient encounters/year—ubiquitous)
- **Current AATD Testing**: Available but underutilized (physicians can order SERPINA1 genotyping—but few know to order, complex test codes)
- **Opportunity**: SIMPLIFY ORDERING (make AATD testing one-click—pre-built order set, insurance pre-authorization support)

**Partnership Approach**:

1. **Develop "AATD Diagnostic Workup" order set** (Quest EMR integration—physician checks one box, Quest runs AAT level + genotype + phenotype, comprehensive report)
2. **Insurance navigation** (Quest pre-verifies coverage—tells physician if covered before ordering, reduces physician hesitation)
3. **Foundation co-marketing** (Foundation educates physicians—"Test for AATD using Quest's simple order set," Quest logo on Foundation materials, mutual benefit)

**Impact**:

- Currently ~5,000 AATD tests ordered through Quest/year (estimated—physicians who know to order)
- Simplified ordering could double: 10,000 tests/year × 15% positive rate = 1,500 new diagnoses/year

---

**8. LabCorp**

- **Market Position**: Second-largest US lab (similar to Quest—1,900 patient service centers, 100M encounters/year)
- **Approach**: Same as Quest (simplify ordering, insurance navigation, co-marketing)

---

**9. Mayo Medical Laboratories**

- **Market Position**: Boutique lab (high-complexity testing—physicians order Mayo for esoteric tests)
- **Current AATD Testing**: Gold standard (Mayo runs most comprehensive SERPINA1 sequencing—detects rare variants)
- **Opportunity**: RARE VARIANT PARTNERSHIP (Foundation funds Mayo to build rare variant database—identify novel AATD mutations, improve diagnostics)

**Partnership Approach**:

- Foundation funds Mayo research: $100K-$200K/year (sequence 1,000 AATD patients—identify rare/novel SERPINA1 variants)
- Mayo shares data with Foundation (Foundation registry gains genetic data—research resource)

---

## Partnership Models

### Model 1: Data Mining (23andMe, AncestryDNA)

**How It Works**:

1. **Foundation requests analysis** (asks 23andMe: "Scan your database for all SERPINA1 mutations, tell us how many AATD patients you have")
2. **Company analyzes retrospectively** (23andMe runs bioinformatics on 30M genomes—identify Pi*ZZ, Pi*SZ, rare variants)
3. **Company notifies customers** (23andMe emails: "Your genetic data shows Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, click here to learn more")
4. **Foundation provides resources** (landing page—"What is AATD?", find a doctor, confirm diagnosis, enroll in registry)

**Legal/Ethical Considerations**:

- ✅ **Customer consent** (23andMe Terms of Service allow health reports—customers opted in)
- ✅ **Validated findings** (SERPINA1 variants well-established—not experimental, clinically actionable)
- ⚠️ **Psychological impact** (unexpected diagnosis—some customers anxious, Foundation must provide support)

**Revenue Model**:

- Foundation pays 23andMe: $0 (23andMe benefits from value-add—no fee)
- OR 23andMe pays Foundation: $100K-$500K (Foundation provides clinical interpretation—consulting fee)
- Foundation offers clinical confirmation: $200-$500/patient (phenotype testing, genetic counseling—Foundation subsidizes for low-income)

---

### Model 2: Add AATD to Existing Panels (Invitae, GeneDx)

**How It Works**:

1. **Foundation negotiates with lab** (Invitae: "Add SERPINA1 to all your multi-gene panels—marginal cost near-zero, diagnoses high-impact")
2. **Lab updates panels** (next software update—SERPINA1 included, all future tests check for AATD)
3. **Lab reports AATD findings** (physician orders cancer panel—report includes "SERPINA1: Pi\*MZ [carrier], recommend follow-up")
4. **Lab refers to Foundation** (report includes: "For AATD resources, visit MarkEglyFoundation.org")

**Legal/Ethical Considerations**:

- ✅ **Informed consent** (patients consented to genetic testing—AATD included in test, not separate consent needed)
- ✅ **Clinical utility** (AATD is medically actionable—not incidental finding of unclear significance)
- ⚠️ **Physician education** (primary care doctors may not know AATD—Foundation must educate or provide specialist referrals)

**Revenue Model**:

- Foundation pays lab: $0 (Invitae adds SERPINA1 for free—marginal cost negligible)
- Foundation provides support: $100K-$200K/year (genetic counselor, physician education materials—Foundation's cost)

---

### Model 3: Subsidized At-Home Testing (Foundation-Funded Program)

**How It Works**:

1. **Foundation partners with lab** (e.g., Invitae, Fulgent—negotiate bulk pricing for AATD-only test)
2. **Foundation offers free/low-cost kits** (website: "Get tested for AATD—$25 at-home kit," Foundation subsidizes remaining $75-$175)
3. **Patient orders, receives kit** (mail-delivered—swab cheek, mail back, results in 2-3 weeks)
4. **Positive results = Foundation follow-up** (genetic counseling, connect to specialist, enroll in registry)

**Target Audiences**:

- **Family members of diagnosed patients** (cascade screening—first-degree relatives have 50% carrier risk, 25% affected risk if both parents carriers)
- **At-risk populations** (ancestry: Northern European, especially Scandinavian—higher carrier rates, South/East Asian much lower)
- **Symptomatic but undiagnosed** (early COPD, unexplained liver disease—physicians didn't test, patient self-refers)

**Economics**:

- Lab cost per test: $100-$200 (SERPINA1 sequencing + interpretation)
- Foundation subsidizes: $75-$175/test (patient pays $25, Foundation pays rest)
- If 5,000 people order/year: $375K-$875K annual cost (Foundation budget line item)
- Diagnostic yield: 15-20% positive (family members higher, general population lower—average 15%)
- Cost per diagnosis: $500-$1,167 (reasonable—compares favorably to $5K-$10K cost of symptomatic patient diagnosis via traditional route)

---

### Model 4: Reflex Testing (Quest, LabCorp)

**How It Works**:

1. **Foundation + lab develop reflex protocol** (if patient has AAT level <100 mg/dL [low]—automatically run genotype, physician doesn't need to re-order)
2. **Lab implements in LIS** (laboratory information system—built-in logic: low AAT → trigger genotype)
3. **Physician receives complete workup** (orders AAT level—gets level + genotype + interpretation, one-stop diagnosis)

**Why Reflex Testing Matters**:

- Currently: Physician orders AAT level → result comes back low → physician must remember to order follow-up genotype (50% forget, patient lost to follow-up)
- With reflex: Physician orders AAT level → lab automatically runs genotype → physician receives complete diagnosis (100% follow-through)

**Negotiation**:

- Foundation pays lab: $0 (reflex testing is standard practice—no additional cost)
- Foundation provides interpretation guidelines: $50K-$100K one-time (develop clinical decision support—when to reflex, how to report)

---

## Data Mining Partnerships

### 23andMe Partnership Deep Dive (Highest Priority)

**Phase 1: Proof of Concept** (Months 1-6, $50K-$100K)

**Step 1: Foundation Initiates Discussion**

- Foundation reaches out to 23andMe Research team (collaborations@23andme.com—they partner with disease foundations regularly)
- Proposal: "Foundation wants to identify undiagnosed AATD patients in 23andMe database—mutual benefit (23andMe adds value to customers, Foundation finds patients)"

**Step 2: 23andMe Analyzes Data**

- 23andMe runs bioinformatics query (scan 30M customer genomes for SERPINA1 variants—Pi*ZZ, Pi*SZ, Pi\*Z null, rare variants)
- Expected findings: 30,000-60,000 AATD patients (1 in 500 - 1 in 1,000 prevalence—depends on definitions, severity cutoffs)

**Step 3: Pilot Notification** (100-500 customers)

- 23andMe emails subset of AATD-positive customers (test messaging—"Your genetic data shows Alpha-1, new finding available in your 23andMe account")
- Foundation provides landing page (education, resources, find specialist, confirm diagnosis)
- Measure response rate (how many click through, how many confirm diagnosis, how many enroll in Foundation registry)

**Success Metrics for Pilot**:

- Click-through rate: 30-50% (of emailed customers click to learn more—indicates interest)
- Confirmation rate: 10-20% (of clicked, complete clinical confirmation—some ignore, some already diagnosed)
- Registry enrollment: 50-70% (of confirmed, enroll in Foundation registry—research participation)

---

**Phase 2: Full Rollout** (Months 7-12, $200K-$500K)

**If Pilot Successful**:

- 23andMe emails all AATD-positive customers (30,000-60,000 customers—largest AATD diagnosis event in history)
- Foundation prepares infrastructure (genetic counselors answer questions, specialist network ready, website scaled for traffic)

**Operational Requirements**:

- **Genetic counseling**: 5-10 FTEs (handle inquiries—"What does Pi\*MZ mean?", "Should I see a doctor?", 30,000 customers × 10% call = 3,000 calls, 20 calls/day/counselor = 150 counselor-days, 5 FTEs for 6 months)
- **Specialist network**: 200+ pulmonologists trained (accept Foundation referrals—23andMe customers in every state, need nationwide coverage)
- **Website infrastructure**: Scale to 100K visitors/month (currently 5K—20x increase, ensure doesn't crash)

**Cost**:

- Genetic counselors: $200K (5 FTEs × 6 months × $8K/month)
- Specialist network development: $100K (training materials, recruiter time, 1 year advance work)
- Website scaling: $50K (cloud hosting, CDN, load testing)
- Marketing/PR: $50K (press release, media outreach—"23andMe + Mark Egly Foundation Identify Tens of Thousands with Rare Disease")
- **Total**: $400K (one-time cost—but identifies 30,000 patients, $13/patient—incredibly cost-effective)

---

**Phase 3: Ongoing Prospective** (Year 2+, $50K-$100K/year)

**All New 23andMe Customers Automatically Checked**:

- 23andMe adds AATD to standard health reports (new customer tests for ancestry—automatically receives AATD check as part of 23andMe+ subscription)
- 2 million new customers/year × 0.1% AATD = 2,000 new diagnoses/year (ongoing annual identification—sustainable pipeline)

**Foundation's Role**:

- Maintain landing page (update resources, specialist directory—annual refresh)
- Answer inquiries (1-2 FTEs ongoing—handle 2,000 new notifications/year)
- Annual data review (23andMe shares aggregate data—how many diagnosed, demographics, outcomes—research insights)

**Cost**: $50K-$100K/year ongoing (1-2 FTE + infrastructure—permanent budget line item)

---

## Clinical Testing Partnerships

### Invitae Partnership Deep Dive

**Goal**: Add SERPINA1 to All Invitae Panels (5M tests/year = 5,000 new diagnoses/year)

**Phase 1: Negotiation** (Months 1-6)

**Foundation's Pitch to Invitae**:

1. **Clinical utility** (AATD is medically actionable—early diagnosis prevents lung damage, liver monitoring, family cascade screening)
2. **Low cost** (Invitae already sequences exomes—adding SERPINA1 to report = marginal cost near-zero, already in data)
3. **Differentiation** (Invitae can market as "most comprehensive genetic test"—includes AATD, competitors may not)
4. **Partnership visibility** (Foundation promotes Invitae to physicians—"We recommend Invitae for AATD testing," co-marketing)

**Invitae's Concerns**:

- ❓ **Physician confusion** (primary care doctors don't know AATD—will ignore findings, waste money to report something not acted on)
- ❓ **Insurance coverage** (payers may deny if AATD not primary indication—e.g., cancer panel, AATD incidental, payer refuses to pay)

**Foundation's Solutions**:

- ✅ **Physician education** (Foundation develops CME course—"What to Do with an AATD Result," train 5,000 physicians, ensure findings acted on)
- ✅ **Specialist referral network** (Foundation provides pulmonologist directory—primary care can refer, don't need to manage themselves)
- ✅ **Insurance advocacy** (Foundation works with payers—argue AATD reporting is standard of care, should be covered on any genetic test)

---

**Phase 2: Implementation** (Months 7-12)

**Invitae Adds SERPINA1 to Panels**:

- Software update (next panel version—all multi-gene panels include SERPINA1 in report)
- Clinician notification (Invitae emails ordering physicians—"Update: All panels now include SERPINA1 [Alpha-1], see educational resources at MarkEglyFoundation.org")

**Foundation Delivers Support**:

- CME course: "Interpreting AATD Genetic Results" (1-hour online module, 1.0 CME credit, educate 5,000 physicians Year 1)
- Specialist directory: 200+ pulmonologists (accept referrals—nationwide coverage, primary care can refer AATD-positive patients)
- Patient resources: Updated website (FAQ, "I received an AATD result, now what?", connect to Foundation services)

---

**Phase 3: Ongoing Stewardship** (Year 2+)

**Annual Review**:

- Invitae shares data: # of AATD findings/year (e.g., 5,000), variant distribution (Pi*ZZ, Pi*SZ, carriers), physician response (how many referred to specialists)
- Foundation analyzes: Which findings most actionable? (Pi*ZZ always referred, Pi*MZ [carrier] often ignored—focus education on carrier management)
- Optimize: Improve physician education (Year 2—add case studies, decision algorithms, increase referral rate)

---

## At-Home Testing Programs

### Foundation-Funded Cascade Screening

**Goal**: Test First-Degree Relatives of Diagnosed Patients (Highest-Yield Population)

**Why Family Members?**

- **Genetics**: If parent has Pi*ZZ AATD—children have 50% chance of inheriting one Z allele (carrier), 0% chance of Pi*ZZ (unless other parent also carrier)
- **If both parents carriers (Pi*MZ × Pi*MZ)**: Children have 25% chance Pi*ZZ (affected), 50% chance Pi*MZ (carrier), 25% chance Pi\*MM (normal)
- **First-degree relatives of Pi\*ZZ patients**: Siblings have 25% chance Pi\*ZZ, 50% chance carrier (high yield—1 in 4 affected)

**Cascade Screening Process**:

1. **Index patient diagnosed** (patient learns they have Pi\*ZZ AATD—first in family to be diagnosed)
2. **Foundation encourages family testing** (genetic counselor: "Your siblings have 25% chance of AATD, we recommend testing," mail 5 free test kits—one for each sibling, parents)
3. **Family members order kits** (mail-in cheek swab—Invitae or Fulgent, Foundation pays $100-$200/kit)
4. **Results return** (2-3 weeks—positive results trigger genetic counseling + specialist referral)

**Expected Yield**:

- Index patient has average 2 siblings (US family size—some more, some fewer)
- 2 siblings × 25% affected = 0.5 additional diagnoses per index patient
- If Foundation diagnoses 1,000 new index patients/year (through other programs)—cascade screening finds 500 additional (50% increase—cascade amplifies every diagnosis strategy)

**Economics**:

- Cost per kit: $100-$200 (Foundation subsidizes—family free)
- Kits per index patient: 5 (2 siblings, 2 parents, 1 spouse [if children]—cast wide net)
- Cost per index patient: $500-$1,000 (5 kits—not all will test, but offer to all)
- Index patients/year: 1,000 (Foundation diagnoses via other programs—23andMe, Invitae, etc.)
- **Total cascade screening budget**: $500K-$1M/year (finds 500 additional patients—$1K-$2K per diagnosis)

---

### At-Risk Population Direct-to-Consumer Campaign

**Goal**: Reach Undiagnosed Symptomatic Patients (Self-Refer for Testing)

**Target Audience**:

- **Early COPD patients** (diagnosed with COPD age <50—unusual, should always check for AATD, but 70% of physicians don't)
- **Unexplained liver disease** (elevated LFTs, no obvious cause—alcohol negative, hepatitis negative, AATD possible)
- **Family history** (know relative has "lung/liver problems," don't know AATD, suspect genetic—"runs in family")

**Marketing Campaign**:

- **Digital ads**: Google ("COPD under 50," "genetic lung disease"), Facebook (target age 30-60, interests: lung health, ancestry, genetics)
- **Landing page**: "Could You Have Alpha-1?" (quiz: early COPD, liver problems, family history—if 2+ yes, "Get tested for $25")
- **Order kit**: Mail-in swab, $25 (Foundation subsidizes $175, patient pays shipping + small fee—psychological commitment, reduces no-shows)

**Expected Volume**:

- Digital ads reach: 1M impressions/year ($50K ad spend—$0.05/impression)
- Click-through: 1% (10,000 visitors to landing page)
- Conversion: 5% (500 order kits—most screen themselves out, only high-suspicion order)
- Diagnostic yield: 30-40% (family history + symptoms = enriched population, higher than 10% general population)
- New diagnoses: 150-200/year (500 kits × 35% positive)

**Economics**:

- Ad spend: $50K/year
- Kit subsidies: 500 kits × $175 = $87.5K/year
- Genetic counseling: $50K/year (1 FTE part-time—handle positive results)
- **Total cost**: $187.5K/year (150-200 diagnoses—$940-$1,250/diagnosis, cost-effective)

---

## Cascade Screening Strategy

### Family-Based Diagnosis Amplification

**Every Diagnosis = Opportunity to Find 3-5 More**:

- Index patient diagnosed → test siblings (find 0.5 on average)
- Index patient diagnosed → test parents (confirm inheritance, find undiagnosed parent—rare but happens, 0.1 on average)
- Index patient diagnosed → test children if patient has kids (find 0.5-1 on average if partner is carrier)
- **Total cascade potential**: 1 index patient → 1-2 additional diagnoses (doubles impact of every diagnosis program)

---

### Operationalizing Cascade Screening

**Step 1: Index Patient Education** (At Time of Diagnosis)

- Genetic counselor explains inheritance (draw pedigree—show who is at risk)
- Provide family testing kits (5 kits—"Mail these to your siblings, parents," pre-paid return envelopes)
- Follow-up (30 days later—"Did your family test? Need more kits?")

**Step 2: Family Outreach**

- Index patient contacts family ("I was diagnosed with genetic condition, you should get tested—here's free kit")
- Some families reluctant (stigma, denial, fear—not all participate)
- Foundation offers alternatives (family member can call Foundation directly—genetic counselor explains, answers questions, sends kit)

**Step 3: Results & Repeat**

- Positive results → new index patient (becomes their own index—start cascade with their family)
- Exponential potential (1 patient → 2 diagnoses → 4 diagnoses → 8 diagnoses—pyramid effect if compliance high)

**Compliance Challenge**:

- Only 30-50% of at-risk family members complete testing (despite free kits—anxiety, procrastination, family dynamics)
- Foundation strategies to improve: Reminder calls, family education webinars ("Why Your Family Should Test"), testimonials from diagnosed patients

---

## Economics & ROI

### Cost Per Diagnosis by Strategy

**Ranked by Cost-Effectiveness**:

1. **23andMe Data Mining**: $13/diagnosis ($400K one-time / 30,000 diagnoses—cheapest, but one-time opportunity)
2. **Cascade Screening**: $1,000-$2,000/diagnosis ($500K-$1M/year / 500 diagnoses—highly efficient, sustainable)
3. **Invitae Panel Addition**: $20-$40/diagnosis ($100K-$200K support / 5,000 diagnoses—very efficient, high volume)
4. **At-Home DTC Campaign**: $940-$1,250/diagnosis ($187.5K/year / 150-200 diagnoses—moderate cost, targets symptomatic)
5. **Quest Reflex Testing**: $67-$100/diagnosis ($100K/year / 1,500 diagnoses—clinical setting, physician-driven)

**For Comparison, Traditional Diagnosis Costs**:

- Symptomatic patient diagnosed via pulmonologist: $5,000-$10,000 (physician visits, imaging, multiple tests, specialist referrals before diagnosis)
- **All genetic testing strategies are 5x-100x more cost-effective than traditional route**

### 10-Year Projection: From 10% to 50% Diagnosed

**Current State**:

- 100,000 US AATD patients (estimated)
- 10,000 diagnosed (10%)
- 90,000 undiagnosed (90%)

**Foundation's 10-Year Goal**: Increase to 50,000 diagnosed (50% diagnosis rate)

**Pathway to 40,000 New Diagnoses**:

- **23andMe retrospective**: 30,000 (Year 1—one-time windfall)
- **23andMe prospective**: 20,000 (Years 2-10—2,000/year × 10 years)
- **Invitae ongoing**: 50,000 (Years 1-10—5,000/year × 10 years)
- **Cascade screening**: 50,000 (Years 1-10—amplifies every diagnosis, adds 50% to all programs)
- **Other strategies**: 20,000 (Quest, DTC, AncestryDNA, GeneDx—smaller contributions)
- **Total**: 170,000 diagnosed over 10 years (accounts for duplicates, natural growth, reduced undiagnosed pool as denominator shrinks)

**Realistic 10-Year Outcome**: 50,000-70,000 diagnosed (50-70% diagnosis rate—up from 10%, transformational)

### Investment Required

**Year 1** ($600K-$900K—launch partnerships):

- 23andMe pilot + rollout: $400K-$500K (one-time)
- Invitae partnership setup: $100K-$200K (implementation + physician education)
- Cascade screening program: $100K-$200K (first 200 index patients × $500-$1K)

**Years 2-5** ($1M-$1.5M/year—scale programs):

- 23andMe prospective: $50K-$100K/year (ongoing support)
- Invitae support: $100K-$200K/year (CME, specialist network, annual optimization)
- Cascade screening: $500K-$1M/year (scale to 1,000 index patients/year)
- DTC campaigns: $187.5K/year (ads + kits)
- Quest/LabCorp: $100K/year (reflex testing support)
- AncestryDNA, GeneDx, others: $200K/year (expand partnerships)

**Years 6-10** ($1.5M-$2M/year—mature programs):

- All programs running at scale (efficiency improves, cost per diagnosis decreases)
- 10,000-15,000 new diagnoses/year (steady state—majority of undiagnosed now identified, incremental diagnoses from new births, immigration, etc.)

**Total 10-Year Investment**: $12M-$18M (identifies 150,000 patients—$80-$120/diagnosis, incredibly cost-effective)

## Implementation Roadmap

### Year 1: Launch Tier 1 Partnerships

**Q1-Q2: 23andMe Negotiation**

- Foundation initiates partnership discussions (research team—draft proposal, estimate patient yield, outline responsibilities)
- 23andMe runs pilot analysis (100-500 customers—test notification messaging, measure response)

**Q3: 23andMe Pilot**

- Email 500 customers (measure click-through, confirmation, registry enrollment)
- Refine messaging ("Your test showed Alpha-1" vs. "Important genetic finding"—optimize)

**Q4: 23andMe Full Rollout**

- Email 30,000-60,000 customers (largest AATD diagnosis event in history—prepare infrastructure, genetic counselors, specialist network, PR)

---

### Year 2: Expand to Clinical Testing

**Q1: Invitae Partnership Launch**

- Invitae adds SERPINA1 to all panels (software update—5M tests/year now check AATD)
- Foundation launches CME course (educate 5,000 physicians—"Interpreting AATD Results")

**Q2-Q4: Other Clinical Labs**

- GeneDx adds AATD to rare disease panels (500K tests/year)
- Quest develops reflex testing protocol (simplify ordering—double testing rate)
- LabCorp follows Quest (second-mover advantage—learn from Quest's rollout)

---

### Year 3-5: Scale & Optimize

**Year 3**:

- AncestryDNA health pilot (AATD first health report—potential 20,000 diagnoses)
- Cascade screening scales (1,000 index patients/year—500 additional diagnoses from families)

**Year 4-5**:

- International expansion (partner with consumer genomics companies in Europe—UK Biobank, German genomics, reach 500K AATD patients globally)
- Rare variant database (partner with Mayo—sequence 10,000 AATD patients, identify all SERPINA1 variants, improve diagnostic accuracy)

## Summary

**Genetic Testing Partnerships = Foundation's Highest-Impact Diagnosis Strategy**:

- ✅ **10x Diagnosis Rate**: From 10% (10,000 diagnosed) to 50-70% (50,000-70,000) in 10 years
- ✅ **Cost-Effective**: $80-$120/diagnosis (vs. $5K-$10K traditional—50x more efficient)
- ✅ **Scalable**: Consumer genomics (50M+ databases), clinical testing (5M+/year)—sustainable pipeline
- ✅ **Proactive**: Catch patients before symptoms (genetic-first, not symptom-first—prevent lung damage)

**Priority Partnerships**:

1. **23andMe** (30,000-60,000 diagnoses Year 1—largest single impact)
2. **Invitae** (5,000/year ongoing—highest annual volume)
3. **Cascade Screening** (doubles every other strategy—force multiplier)

**10-Year Investment**: $12M-$18M total (identifies 150,000 patients—transforms AATD from 90% undiagnosed to majority diagnosed)
