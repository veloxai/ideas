# Mark Egly Foundation - Master Project Plan

**Mission**: Ending diagnostic delays and improving outcomes for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) patients through education, research, advocacy, and support.

**Founded by**: Mark Egly, PGA Member  
**Project Start**: November 7, 2025

---

## 🎯 Foundation Overview

### The Problem

**Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD)** is an orphan genetic disease that:
- Takes **7-8 years** and **4+ medical professionals** to diagnose on average
- Is often misdiagnosed as asthma or COPD
- Affects lung and liver function
- Is inherited genetically (Mark's children each have at least one mutated gene)
- New science shows even **MZ carriers** (one mutated gene) can have medical issues
- Is preventable/manageable with early detection and treatment

### Mark's Story

Mark Egly had to **self-diagnose** his AATD after years of symptoms. This diagnostic odyssey inspired him to:
1. Found this foundation to prevent others from the same struggle
2. Secure a **patent for repurposing AAT protein** ([Patent US20220160847](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20220160847))
3. Advocate for newborn screening and early detection
4. Build education programs for medical professionals

### Foundation Goals

**Primary Objectives**:
1. **Reduce diagnostic delay** from 7-8 years to <1 year
2. **Educate medical professionals** about AATD recognition
3. **Support patients** through testing, treatment, and community
4. **Advance research** into testing, treatment, and prevention
5. **Advocate for policy changes** (newborn screening, protected status)
6. **Commercialize innovations** (AAT glucometer, Mark's patent, etc.)

## 🔑 Key Strategic Initiatives

### Immediate High-Impact Programs

**1. AATD Certification Seal Program** (Like Fair Underwriting)
- Medical institutions get "AATD Aware" certification
- Demonstrates commitment to early detection
- Provides education materials and protocols
- Marketing benefit for participating institutions

**2. Physician Malpractice Education**
- CME-accredited courses on diagnostic delay risks
- Legal case studies of missed AATD diagnoses
- Differential diagnosis protocols
- Risk mitigation strategies

**3. Newborn Screening Advocacy**
- Push for AATD inclusion in state newborn screening panels
- Model legislation for all 50 states
- Evidence-based policy briefs
- Coalition building with other rare disease groups

**4. AAT "Glucometer" Device**
- Portable device to measure circulating AAT levels
- Enables real-time monitoring (like diabetes management)
- Early warning system for exacerbations
- Could be breakthrough product

**5. Data Donation Tax Deduction Program**
- Novel approach: tax write-off for DNA sequence donation
- Builds comprehensive research database
- Anonymized data for research
- Incentivizes participation

### Innovative Ideas & Recommendations

**Partnerships**:
- **23andMe/Ancestry.com**: Flag AATD carriers in existing databases
- **Pharmaceutical Companies**: AAT replacement therapy manufacturers
- **Medical Schools**: Integrate AATD into curriculum
- **Firefighter Unions**: Occupational health advocacy (smoke exposure)
- **Military**: Mandatory screening for service members

**Revenue Streams** (Sustainability):
