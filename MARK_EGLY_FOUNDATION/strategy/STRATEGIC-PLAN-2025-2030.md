## Executive Summary

### Our 5-Year Vision

**By 2030, the Mark Egly Foundation will have cut AATD diagnostic delays in half (from 7-8 years to 3-4 years), established newborn screening in 10+ states, and become the leading patient advocacy organization for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency.**

### The Challenge We're Solving

Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) is an orphan genetic disease affecting an estimated 100,000+ diagnosed Americans and 300,000+ undiagnosed. The average diagnostic delay is 7-8 years, resulting in preventable lung damage, reduced quality of life, and early mortality.

**Mark Egly's Story**: As a PGA Member, Mark self-diagnosed his AATD after years of symptoms. His diagnostic journey revealed systemic failures: physicians don't think to test, patients don't know it exists, and policy doesn't prioritize rare diseases. Mark holds a patent (US20220160847) for repurposing AAT protein for firefighters, military personnel, and asthma patients—demonstrating the broader potential of AATD research.

### Our Strategic Approach

We attack the problem from **four interconnected angles**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  EDUCATE → Physicians + Patients + Public               │
│  SUPPORT → Financial Aid + Navigation + Community       │
│  RESEARCH → Innovation + Data + Better Tools            │
│  ADVOCATE → Policy Change + Systems Reform              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Strategic Context

### Where We Are Today (November 2025)

**Foundation Status**:

- ✅ 501(c)(3) status: Active
- ✅ Board of Directors: Forming
- ✅ Website: old.markeglyfoundation.com (needs redesign)
- ✅ Core asset: Mark's patent (US20220160847)
- 🔶 Funding: Bootstrapping phase
- 🔶 Staff: Founder + early team
- 🔶 Programs: Planning/pilot phase

**Market Context**:

- **AATD patient population**: 100,000 diagnosed, 300,000+ undiagnosed (US)
- **Competitive landscape**:
  - Alpha-1 Foundation (established, research-focused)
  - AlphaNet (patient support)
  - Pharma companies (augmentation therapy providers)
- **Our differentiation**:
  - Founder-driven with personal patent
  - Focus on diagnostic delay (unmet need)
  - Physician education + policy advocacy combination
  - Innovation pipeline (glucometer, rapid testing)

**Opportunity Assessment**:

- ✅ **High-impact problem**: 7-8 year delay is preventable
- ✅ **Underserved need**: No org focused primarily on diagnostic delay
- ✅ **Policy momentum**: Rare disease advocacy growing
- ✅ **Innovation potential**: Mark's patent + research partnerships

## Risk Management

### Risk 1: Funding Shortfalls

**Likelihood**: High (Year 1-2), Medium (Year 3-5)
**Impact**: Critical

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Diversified revenue**: Don't rely on single source
2. **Phased approach**: Scale programs based on funding
3. **Cost controls**: Lean operations, maximize volunteer support
4. **Reserve fund**: Build 6-month operating reserve by Year 3
5. **Contingency plans**: Prioritize high-impact programs if cuts needed

**Scenario Planning**:

- **Best case** (110% of goal): Accelerate timeline
- **Base case** (100% of goal): Execute as planned
- **Downside** (75% of goal): Scale back support/research, maintain education/advocacy
- **Worst case** (50% of goal): Focus only on education, pause other programs

---

### Risk 2: Physician Adoption

**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High

**Risk**: Physicians don't change behavior despite education

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Incentives**: Tie to malpractice insurance discounts
2. **Ease of use**: Make testing/protocols turnkey
3. **Peer influence**: Leverage early adopters as champions
4. **Measurement**: Track behavior change, adapt approach
5. **Systems focus**: Work with institutions, not just individuals

**Early Warning Signs**:

- Low CME enrollment
- Physicians complete course but don't test more
- Certification program has few applicants

**Pivot Options**:

- Focus on policy mandates (required testing protocols)
- Target high-volume institutions vs. individual physicians
- Simplify testing process further

---

### Risk 3: Innovation Delays

**Likelihood**: Medium-High
**Impact**: Medium

**Risk**: AAT glucometer takes longer/costs more than expected

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Phased development**: Prototype → validation → FDA → launch
2. **Expert partners**: Work with established device companies
3. **Parallel paths**: Pursue multiple innovations simultaneously
4. **Realistic timelines**: Build in buffer for setbacks
5. **Alternative revenue**: Don't rely solely on glucometer royalties

**Contingency**:

- If glucometer delayed: Focus on rapid DNA testing simplification
- If too expensive: Seek grant funding for R&D
- If technical hurdles: Partner with larger medical device firm

---

### Risk 4: Policy Setbacks

**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium

**Risk**: Newborn screening legislation stalls or fails

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **State-by-state approach**: Don't need all 50 immediately
2. **Bipartisan strategy**: Make it non-partisan issue
3. **Coalition strength**: United front with other rare diseases
4. **Patient stories**: Humanize the issue
5. **Economic argument**: Early detection saves healthcare dollars

**Alternative Approaches**:

- If state legislation fails: Focus on voluntary hospital screening
- If federal bill stalls: Pursue regulatory pathway (CDC, NIH)
- If policy route blocked: Focus on medical system change

---

### Risk 5: Competition

**Likelihood**: Low-Medium
**Impact**: Low-Medium

**Risk**: Established orgs (Alpha-1 Foundation, AlphaNet) expand into our space

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Differentiation**: Focus on diagnostic delay (our unique niche)
2. **Collaboration**: Partner rather than compete
3. **Innovation**: Our IP (Mark's patent, glucometer) creates moat
4. **Founder story**: Mark's personal journey is unique asset
5. **Speed**: Move fast to establish leadership

**Competitive Advantages**:

- ✅ Founder-driven with personal patent
- ✅ Focus on prevention (not just treatment)
- ✅ Physician education + policy combined
- ✅ Innovation pipeline

## Conclusion: Our 5-Year Commitment

The Mark Egly Foundation commits to an ambitious but achievable goal: **cut AATD diagnostic delays in half by 2030**. We will do this by:

✅ **Educating** 50,000+ physicians and millions of patients
✅ **Supporting** 50,000+ patients with financial aid and navigation
✅ **Researching** innovations like the AAT glucometer and simplified testing
✅ **Advocating** for policy changes in 10+ states and federally

**We will measure our success** not by dollars raised or programs launched, but by **lives saved through earlier diagnosis**.

**This strategic plan is our roadmap**, but we remain flexible to adapt as we learn. We are committed to evidence-based decision-making, transparent operations, and patient-first values.

**By 2030, AATD will no longer be an overlooked orphan disease.** It will be a condition every physician recognizes, every patient can access support for, and policy protects.

**This is Mark's vision. This is our commitment.**
