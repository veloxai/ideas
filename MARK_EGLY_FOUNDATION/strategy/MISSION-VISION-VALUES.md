## 🎯 Mission Statement

> **The Mark Egly Foundation exists to eliminate diagnostic delays and improve outcomes for individuals affected by Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency through education, research, advocacy, and compassionate support.**

We achieve this by:
- **Educating** medical professionals to recognize and diagnose AATD early
- **Supporting** patients and families through testing, treatment, and community
- **Advancing** research into better detection, treatment, and prevention
- **Advocating** for policy changes that protect and empower AATD patients
- **Innovating** new technologies and approaches to AATD care

---

## 🌟 Vision Statement

> **A world where no one suffers from undiagnosed Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency.**

**By 2035**, we envision:
- **Universal newborn screening** for AATD in all 50 states
- **Diagnostic delay reduced** from 7-8 years to less than 1 year
- **Every physician** trained to recognize AATD symptoms
- **Comprehensive support systems** for every AATD patient
- **Breakthrough treatments** resulting from accelerated research
- **AATD recognized** as a protected condition with full insurance coverage

We will transform AATD from an overlooked orphan disease into a well-understood, treatable condition with early detection protocols and robust patient support.

---

## 💙 Core Values

### 1. **Patient First** 🫁

**Definition**: Every decision prioritizes the health, dignity, and well-being of AATD patients and their families.

**In Practice**:
- Listen deeply to patient experiences and needs
- Design programs based on patient feedback
- Measure success by patient outcomes, not just metrics
- Ensure accessibility of all resources (no patient left behind)
- Treat patients as partners, not beneficiaries

**Why It Matters**: Mark's journey of self-diagnosis after years of struggle reminds us that patients are experts in their own experience. We exist to serve them.

---

### 2. **Urgency** ⏰

**Definition**: Every day of diagnostic delay is a day of preventable suffering. We act with purpose and speed.

**In Practice**:
- Prioritize high-impact initiatives that save time
- Move quickly from strategy to implementation
- Embrace calculated risks to accelerate progress
- Streamline processes to reduce bureaucracy
- Celebrate quick wins while pursuing long-term goals

**Why It Matters**: The average 7-8 year diagnostic delay costs lives, lung function, and quality of life. We cannot afford to move slowly.

---

### 3. **Evidence-Based** 🔬

**Definition**: Science, data, and research guide our decisions. We commit to intellectual rigor and continuous learning.

**In Practice**:
- Base programs on peer-reviewed research
- Measure impact rigorously and transparently
- Partner with credible academic and medical institutions
- Pivot when evidence suggests a better approach
- Share data openly to advance collective knowledge

**Why It Matters**: AATD is a medical condition requiring medical solutions. Credibility comes from scientific integrity.

---

### 4. **Collaboration Over Competition** 🤝

**Definition**: We partner generously with other organizations, researchers, and stakeholders to maximize collective impact.

**In Practice**:
- Share resources, knowledge, and best practices freely
- Celebrate other organizations' successes
- Build coalitions rather than work in silos
- Seek partnerships that amplify our reach
- Credit collaborators and contributors prominently

**Why It Matters**: AATD affects too few people for organizations to compete. Together, we are stronger.

---

### 5. **Innovation** 💡

**Definition**: We challenge the status quo and pioneer new approaches to AATD detection, treatment, and support.

**In Practice**:
- Invest in breakthrough technologies (AAT glucometer, rapid testing)
- Commercialize Mark's patent to fund research and expand access
- Experiment with novel programs (data donation tax deduction)
- Learn from failures and iterate quickly
- Think beyond traditional nonprofit models

**Why It Matters**: Incremental improvement won't solve the diagnostic delay crisis. Bold innovation is required.

---

### 6. **Transparency** 🔍

**Definition**: We operate with openness, honesty, and accountability to donors, patients, and partners.

**In Practice**:
- Publish financials and impact reports publicly
- Admit mistakes and share lessons learned
- Make decision-making processes clear
- Welcome feedback and constructive criticism
- Protect patient privacy while sharing aggregate insights

**Why It Matters**: Trust is earned through transparency. Donors and patients deserve to see exactly how we operate.

---

### 7. **Hope** 🌅

**Definition**: We inspire optimism and possibility for AATD patients, even in the face of a chronic condition.

**In Practice**:
- Tell stories of thriving, not just surviving
- Celebrate milestones, big and small
- Connect newly diagnosed patients with community
- Frame AATD as manageable with proper care
- Emphasize what's possible, not just what's difficult

**Why It Matters**: A diagnosis of AATD can be terrifying. We provide hope that a full, meaningful life is possible.

## 🎭 Our Story: Why We Exist

### Mark Egly's Journey

Mark Egly is a PGA Member who experienced firsthand the devastating consequences of delayed AATD diagnosis. Like thousands of others, Mark:
- Suffered from symptoms for years
- Saw multiple doctors who missed the diagnosis
- Eventually **self-diagnosed** after extensive research
- Lost precious time and lung function due to the delay

### The Diagnostic Delay Crisis

**The current reality**:
- Average time to diagnosis: **7-8 years**
- Average number of physicians consulted: **4+**
- Common misdiagnoses: Asthma, COPD, allergies
- Outcome: Preventable lung damage, delayed treatment

**Why delays happen**:
- AATD is an "orphan disease" (rare, often overlooked)
- Physicians aren't trained to look for it
- Symptoms mimic more common conditions
- No standard screening protocols exist
- Genetic testing not routinely offered

### The Hidden Population: MZ Carriers

Emerging science reveals that even **heterozygous carriers** (one mutated gene) like Mark's children can experience health impacts:
- Increased lung disease risk with environmental exposures
- Potential liver involvement
- Previously dismissed as "just carriers"
- Millions of Americans may be affected

This discovery expands the urgent need for:
- **Carrier awareness and education**
- **Monitoring protocols for MZ individuals**
- **Research into single-gene impacts**
- **Family cascade testing**

### Mark's Patent: Turning Innovation into Impact

Mark secured **US Patent 20220160847** for repurposing Alpha-1 Antitrypsin protein for:
- Treatment of other diseases
- Protection for firefighters (smoke inhalation)
- Asthma management
- Military applications (combat exposures)
- Novel delivery methods

**Foundation Impact**:
- Licensing revenue funds patient assistance
- Advances treatment accessibility
- Demonstrates innovation leadership
- Creates sustainable funding model

### Why This Foundation Matters

**No one should have to self-diagnose a genetic condition.**

The Mark Egly Foundation exists because:
1. **Patients deserve faster answers** - 7-8 years is unacceptable
2. **Physicians need better education** - AATD must be on their radar
3. **Research needs acceleration** - Innovations like the AAT glucometer can save lives
4. **Families need support** - Navigating AATD shouldn't be a solo journey
5. **Policy must change** - Newborn screening should be universal

## 📊 Theory of Change (Simplified)

```
IF we educate physicians about AATD...
  THEN more patients will be diagnosed earlier
  
IF patients are diagnosed earlier...
  THEN they can start treatment sooner
  
IF treatment starts sooner...
  THEN lung function is preserved and outcomes improve
  
IF we support patients through their journey...
  THEN they thrive rather than just survive
  
IF we advocate for policy changes...
  THEN systemic barriers to early diagnosis are removed
  
IF we fund innovative research...
  THEN we accelerate breakthroughs in detection and treatment

ULTIMATE OUTCOME:
AATD transforms from an overlooked orphan disease 
with devastating diagnostic delays into a well-understood, 
manageable condition with early detection, effective treatment, 
and comprehensive support.
```
