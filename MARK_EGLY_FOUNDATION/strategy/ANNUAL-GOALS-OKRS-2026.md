## Celebrating Wins & Learning from Misses

### When We Hit OKRs

- 🎉 Share with board and donors
- 🎉 Public announcement (build momentum)
- 🎉 Thank partners and volunteers

**Amplify**:

- Document what worked (create playbook)
- Share learnings with team
- Look for opportunities to replicate success

---

### When We Miss OKRs

**Analyze**:

- Was the OKR unrealistic?
- Did we execute poorly?
- Were there external factors?
- What can we learn?

**Adapt**:

- Adjust strategy if needed
- Revise OKR if appropriate
- Communicate transparently
- Recommit to mission

**Example**:

> "We set a goal to train 1,000 physicians but only reached 700. After analysis, we learned that free CME courses have low completion rates. In Year 2, we're adding incentives (malpractice insurance discounts) and shortening the course. We're confident this will help us exceed our Year 2 goal of 6,000 physicians."
