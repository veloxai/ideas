## Framework Overview

### What Is Impact Measurement?

Impact measurement is how we answer the question: **"Are we achieving our mission?"**

For the Mark Egly Foundation, this means:

- ✅ Are diagnostic delays decreasing?
- ✅ Are more patients being diagnosed earlier?
- ✅ Are health outcomes improving?
- ✅ Are systems changing (policy, medical practice)?

### Our Measurement Approach

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  INPUTS → ACTIVITIES → OUTPUTS → OUTCOMES → IMPACT     │
│                                                         │
│  What we     What we      What we      What           Ultimate  │
│  invest      do           produce      changes         goal      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

We measure at **all five levels**:

1. **Inputs**: Resources invested (money, time, partnerships)
2. **Activities**: Programs executed (CME courses, grants, advocacy)
3. **Outputs**: Direct results (physicians trained, patients served)
4. **Outcomes**: Changes in behavior/systems (earlier testing, policy wins)
5. **Impact**: Ultimate goal achieved (diagnostic delays eliminated)

---

## Impact Measurement Philosophy

### Guiding Principles

**1. Mission-Driven Metrics**

- Every metric ties back to our mission: eliminate diagnostic delays
- If a metric doesn't inform our strategy, we don't track it
- Quality over quantity (meaningful impact > vanity metrics)

**2. Patient-Centered**

- Patient outcomes are the ultimate measure of success
- Patient voices included in evaluation
- We measure what matters to patients, not just what's easy to count

**3. Evidence-Based**

- Data-driven decision making
- Rigorous evaluation methods
- Honest assessment (celebrate wins, learn from failures)

**4. Transparent Reporting**

- Publish impact data annually
- Share successes AND challenges
- Invite external evaluation

**5. Continuous Improvement**

- Metrics inform strategy adjustments
- Quarterly reviews for course correction
- Willingness to pivot if something isn't working

### What Success Looks Like

**Short-Term Success** (1-2 years):

- Programs launched and scaling
- Early adoption by physicians
- Patient community growing
- Awareness increasing

**Medium-Term Success** (3-5 years):

- Measurable decrease in diagnostic delay
- Policy wins in multiple states
- Research innovations advancing
- National recognition as AATD leader

**Long-Term Success** (5-10 years):

- Diagnostic delay cut in half
- Systemic change achieved
- Universal newborn screening
- Model replicated for other rare diseases

---

## Primary Impact Metric

### Diagnostic Delay Time (DDT)

**Definition**: Average time from first symptom presentation to confirmed AATD diagnosis

**Why This Metric?**

- ✅ Directly measures our mission
- ✅ Captures cumulative impact of all programs
- ✅ Meaningful to patients (lived experience)
- ✅ Comparable over time (trend analysis)

**Measurement Method**:

```
For each newly diagnosed patient, calculate:

DDT = Date of Diagnosis - Date of First AATD-Related Symptom

Example:
- First symptom (shortness of breath): January 2018
- Diagnosis: March 2025
- DDT = 7 years, 2 months
```

**Data Collection**:

- Annual survey of newly diagnosed patients (sample size: 500+)
- Questions:
  - When did you first experience symptoms?
  - When were you diagnosed?
  - How many physicians did you see?
  - What were you initially diagnosed with?
  - How did you finally get diagnosed?

**Baseline & Targets**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  DIAGNOSTIC DELAY TIME (Years)                          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Baseline (2025):     7-8 years                         │
│  Target Year 1 (2026): 7-8 years (building phase)       │
│  Target Year 2 (2027): 6-7 years (early impact)         │
│  Target Year 3 (2028): 5-6 years (measurable change)    │
│  Target Year 4 (2029): 4-5 years (acceleration)         │
│  Target Year 5 (2030): 3-4 years ✅ (GOAL)              │
│                                                         │
│  Long-Term (2035):    <1 year (ultimate vision)         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Statistical Analysis**:

- Mean and median DDT
- Distribution (25th, 50th, 75th percentile)
- Year-over-year change
- Statistical significance testing
- Subgroup analysis (age, geography, genotype)

**Reporting**:

- Published annually in impact report
- Trend line visualization
- Confidence intervals included
- Methodology transparent

---

## Success Celebration & Learning

### When We Hit Milestones

**Celebrate**:

- 🎉 Public announcement (press release)
- 🎉 Internal celebration (staff/volunteer recognition)
- 🎉 Share patient stories
- 🎉 Thank donors and partners

**Learn**:

- What worked? (document best practices)
- Can we replicate this success elsewhere?
- What surprised us?

---

### When We Miss Targets

**Honest Assessment**:

- Why did we miss the target? (root cause analysis)
- Was the target unrealistic?
- Did we execute poorly?
- Were there external factors?

**Learn & Adapt**:

- Adjust strategy if needed
- Revise targets if appropriate
- Communicate transparently (don't hide failures)
- Recommit to mission

**Example Response**:

> "We set a goal to train 5,000 physicians this year but only reached 3,200. After analysis, we discovered that our free CME approach led to low completion rates (40%). In response, we're adding incentives (malpractice insurance discounts) and shortening the course. We're confident these changes will help us exceed next year's goal."

## Summary: Measuring What Matters

The Mark Egly Foundation measures impact at multiple levels:

**✅ Primary Impact**: Diagnostic delay reduction (ultimate goal)
**✅ Program Outcomes**: Education, Support, Research, Advocacy metrics
**✅ Organizational Health**: Financial, capacity, partnership strength

**Our commitment**:

- 📊 **Data-driven** decision making
- 🔍 **Transparent** reporting (share everything publicly)
- 📈 **Continuous improvement** (learn and adapt)
- 💙 **Patient-centered** (measure what matters to patients)

**By 2030**, we will have rigorous data proving that our multi-pronged approach works. We will share our model openly so other rare disease foundations can replicate our success.

**This is how we ensure Mark's vision becomes reality.**
