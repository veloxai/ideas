## Occupational Risk Overview

### Why Occupation Matters for AATD

**The Science**:

- **AATD = Low AAT Protein** (alpha-1 antitrypsin protects lungs from damage)
- **Lung Irritants = Inflammation** (smoke, dust, chemicals, fumes trigger inflammation)
- **Low AAT + Inflammation = Accelerated Lung Disease** (emphysema develops faster, earlier)

**High-Risk Occupations**:

1. **Firefighters**: Smoke, toxic gases, particulate matter (even with PPE)
2. **Military**: Burn pits (Iraq/Afghanistan), industrial exposures, combat exposures
3. **Mining**: Coal dust, silica dust
4. **Manufacturing**: Chemical fumes, particulate matter
5. **Construction**: Dust, asbestos, silica
6. **Agriculture**: Pesticides, grain dust, animal dander
7. **Welding**: Metal fumes

**The Problem**:

- Workers with AATD don't know they have it (undiagnosed)
- Occupational exposures accelerate disease (30s-40s instead of 50s-60s)
- Early disability or death (preventable with early detection + career change)
- Workers' compensation battles (is it genetic or occupational?)

---

### Foundation's Position

**1. Early Detection**:

- High-risk occupations should offer AATD screening (voluntary, pre-employment or periodic)
- Goal: Identify workers with AATD BEFORE significant lung damage

**2. Accommodation**:

- Workers with AATD should have option to transfer to lower-exposure roles (not forced out)
- Example: Firefighter with AATD → administrative role, fire prevention, training

**3. Protection**:

- Improved PPE, exposure monitoring, workplace controls (benefit all workers, especially AATD)

**4. Compensation**:

- Workers with AATD who develop lung disease due to occupational exposures deserve workers' compensation (even if genetic component)

**Balance**: Worker safety + privacy (genetic discrimination concerns)

---

## Firefighter Advocacy Strategy

### The Firefighter-AATD Connection

**Why Firefighters Are at Risk**:

- Smoke exposure (structure fires, wildland fires)
- Toxic gases (CO, hydrogen cyanide, etc.)
- Particulate matter (even with SCBA—self-contained breathing apparatus)
- Chronic, repeated exposures (career firefighters: 20-30 years)

**Evidence**:

- Firefighters have higher COPD rates than general population
- Some firefighters with early COPD likely have undiagnosed AATD
- AATD accelerates smoke-related lung damage

**Challenges**:

- Firefighters are "tough" culture (may resist genetic testing—seen as weakness)
- Genetic discrimination fears (will I lose my job? Be denied workers' comp?)
- Union concerns (testing used against firefighters?)

**Approach**:

- Voluntary testing (not mandatory)
- Genetic privacy protections (results confidential, cannot be used for hiring/firing)
- Reframe as "empowerment" (knowledge = career planning, not career-ending)

---

### Policy Goals

**1. Voluntary AATD Screening Programs**:

- Fire departments offer AATD testing (blood test: AAT level + genotype)
- Pre-employment (optional—candidate choice) OR periodic (every 5 years for active firefighters)
- Free (paid by department or Foundation)

**2. Genetic Privacy Protections**:

- AATD test results confidential (HIPAA + state genetic privacy laws)
- Cannot be used for:
  - Hiring/firing decisions
  - Job assignments (unless firefighter voluntarily discloses + requests accommodation)
  - Workers' compensation denials (see below)

**3. Accommodation Options**:

- Firefighters with AATD have option to transfer to lower-exposure roles:
  - Fire prevention/inspection
  - Training/education
  - Administrative roles
  - Emergency medical services (EMS)—less smoke exposure
- NOT forced out of department

**4. Workers' Compensation Presumption**:

- If firefighter has AATD + develops lung disease (COPD, emphysema) → **presumed work-related** (eligible for workers' comp)
- Rationale: Occupational exposure accelerated genetic condition (combined causation)

---

### Legislative Strategy

**Model Legislation**: "Firefighter AATD Screening and Protection Act"

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Voluntary Screening**:
   - Fire departments to offer AATD testing to all firefighters (new hires + active)
   - Voluntary (opt-in)
   - Free (department pays, or state grant)

2. **Genetic Privacy**:
   - Test results confidential (cannot be disclosed without firefighter consent)
   - Prohibited uses: Hiring, firing, assignment, workers' comp denials

3. **Accommodation**:
   - Firefighters with AATD can request transfer to lower-exposure role (department must accommodate if feasible)
   - No reduction in pay or benefits

4. **Workers' Compensation**:
   - Presumptive coverage: Firefighter with AATD + lung disease = work-related (unless employer proves otherwise)

5. **Education**:
   - Fire academies to include AATD education in training curriculum
   - Annual awareness campaigns (AATD + occupational health)

**Target States**: Pennsylvania, Florida, California (strong firefighter unions, rare disease advocacy)

**Timeline**:

- **2028**: Draft legislation, engage firefighter unions
- **2029**: Introduce in 2-3 states
- **2030**: Passage in 1+ states (aspirational)

---

### Union Engagement

**Target Unions**:

- **International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF)**: 300K+ members, U.S./Canada
- **National Volunteer Fire Council (NVFC)**: Volunteer firefighters
- **State/local unions**: Target key states (PA, FL, CA)

**Engagement Strategy**:

**1. Education**:

- Present to union leadership (IAFF conventions, state conferences)
- Materials: "AATD and Firefighters: What Every Firefighter Should Know"
- Message: AATD screening empowers firefighters (early detection = career planning)

**2. Address Concerns**:

- **Genetic Discrimination**: We support strong privacy protections (test results confidential)
- **Job Loss**: Voluntary testing + accommodation (not career-ending, career-planning)
- **Workers' Comp**: We advocate for presumptive coverage (AATD + lung disease = work-related)

**3. Partnership**:

- Offer free AATD screening to union members (Foundation pays)
- Partner on awareness campaigns (AATD education at union events)

**4. Champion Identification**:

- Find firefighters with AATD (personal stories)
- Champions speak to union members (peer-to-peer education)

---

### Pilot Programs

**Firefighter AATD Screening Pilot**:

**Goal**: Demonstrate feasibility, acceptance, prevalence

**Partners**: 3-5 fire departments (urban + rural, volunteer + career)

**Protocol**:

1. Recruit departments (voluntary participation)
2. Offer free AATD testing to all firefighters (opt-in)
3. Genetic counseling for AATD-positive firefighters (education, family screening, career planning)
4. Track outcomes:
   - Participation rate (% of firefighters tested)
   - Prevalence (% AATD-positive)
   - Follow-up actions (career changes, treatment started, family screening)

**Budget**: $50K (500 firefighters × $100/test)

**Timeline**:

- **2027**: Design pilot, recruit departments
- **2028**: Implement pilot (testing + counseling)
- **2029**: Evaluate, publish results

**Use Results**: Evidence for state legislation, union engagement, national replication

## Military Advocacy Strategy

### The Military-AATD Connection

**Why Military Service Members Are at Risk**:

- **Burn pits**: Iraq, Afghanistan (incineration of waste—plastics, chemicals, medical waste, etc.)
- **Industrial exposures**: Ships (asbestos, chemicals), aircraft maintenance (fuel, solvents)
- **Combat exposures**: Smoke, dust, explosions
- **Training exposures**: Firing ranges (lead, particulate matter)

**Evidence**:

- Veterans exposed to burn pits have higher rates of respiratory disease
- Some veterans with "unexplained COPD" likely have AATD (accelerated by exposures)
- VA recognizes burn pit exposure as service-connected condition (but AATD often missed)

---

### Policy Goals

**1. VA AATD Screening Initiative**:

- **Target Population**: Veterans with unexplained COPD, emphysema, or chronic respiratory symptoms (especially burn pit exposure)
- **Screening Protocol**: Offer AATD testing (AAT level + genotype) as part of standard workup
- **Education**: VA providers trained on AATD (when to test, how to interpret results)

**2. Service-Connected Disability Presumption**:

- **Current**: VA recognizes burn pit exposure as service-connected (if veteran deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan 2001-2021)
- **Proposed**: If veteran has AATD + lung disease + burn pit exposure → **presumed service-connected** (eligible for disability benefits)
- **Rationale**: Burn pit exposure accelerated genetic condition (combined causation)

**3. Active-Duty Screening**:

- **Long-term goal**: Add AATD to military entrance medical screening (MEPS—Military Entrance Processing Station)
- **Rationale**: Identify service members with AATD before deployments (inform career planning, avoid high-risk exposures)
- **Challenge**: Genetic discrimination concerns (will disqualify people from service?)
- **Approach**: Pilot program first (voluntary screening for active-duty personnel)

---

### VA Engagement

**Target**: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)

**Strategy**:

**1. VA Leadership Meetings**:

- Meet with VA leadership (Veterans Health Administration, Office of Research and Development)
- Present: AATD and veterans (burn pit connection, diagnostic delays, treatment options)

**2. VA Directive**:

- Request VA issue clinical directive: "AATD Screening for Veterans with Respiratory Disease"
- Recommend AATD testing for veterans with:
  - Unexplained COPD or emphysema (especially age <50)
  - Burn pit exposure history
  - Family history of AATD or early emphysema

**3. VA Research**:

- Fund VA research: "Prevalence of AATD Among Veterans with Burn Pit Exposure"
- Partner with VA researchers (collaborate on studies)

**4. VA Provider Education**:

- Develop CME for VA providers (AATD 101, when to test, treatment options)
- Distribute through VA Office of Academic Affiliations

---

### Congressional Advocacy (Veterans Affairs Committees)

**Target Committees**:

- House Committee on Veterans' Affairs
- Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs

**Ask**:

1. **Congressional Hearing**: "Undiagnosed Conditions Among Veterans: The Case of AATD"
   - Witnesses: Veteran with AATD (burn pit exposure), VA physician, patient advocate
2. **Appropriations**: Request funding for VA AATD screening initiative ($5M/year)
3. **Oversight**: Request VA report on AATD prevalence among veterans (data collection)

**Timeline**:

- **2028**: Engage veterans committees, request hearing
- **2029**: Hearing (if successful), appropriations request
- **2030**: VA pilot program launched (aspirational)

---

### Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs)

**Target VSOs**:

- American Legion
- Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW)
- Disabled American Veterans (DAV)
- Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA)

**Engagement Strategy**:

- Present at VSO conferences (educate about AATD)
- Partner on burn pit advocacy (many VSOs already advocating for burn pit victims)
- Identify veteran champions (veterans with AATD share stories)

---

## Industrial Worker Strategy

### High-Risk Industries

**Priority Industries**:

1. **Mining**: Coal, silica dust (Appalachia, Wyoming, West Virginia)
2. **Manufacturing**: Chemical plants, refineries (Texas, Louisiana, Ohio)
3. **Construction**: Dust, asbestos, silica (nationwide)
4. **Welding**: Metal fumes (manufacturing, construction, shipyards)

**Strategy**: Partner with labor unions, OSHA, state occupational health agencies

---

### Labor Union Engagement

**Target Unions**:

- United Mine Workers of America (UMWA)
- United Steelworkers (USW)
- International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM)
- Laborers' International Union of North America (LiUNA)

**Engagement**:

- Education: "AATD and Occupational Lung Disease"
- Offer: Free AATD screening to union members (pilot programs)
- Advocacy: Support workers' comp for AATD + occupational lung disease

---

### OSHA Engagement

**Target**: U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)

**Opportunity**:

- OSHA regulates workplace exposures (dust, fumes, chemicals)
- OSHA does not mandate AATD screening (but could recommend)

**Strategy**:

- **OSHA Outreach**: Meet with OSHA leadership (present AATD + occupational health connection)
- **Guidance Document**: Request OSHA issue guidance: "Medical Surveillance for Workers in High-Exposure Industries" (include AATD screening recommendation)
- **State OSHA Plans**: Engage state OSHA plans (some states have more authority than federal OSHA)

---

## Workers' Compensation

### The Workers' Comp Challenge

**Question**: Is AATD-related lung disease work-related or genetic?

**Answer**: **Both** (combined causation)

**Current Problem**:

- Workers with AATD who develop lung disease often denied workers' comp
- Argument: "It's genetic, not work-related"
- Counterargument: "Yes, genetic—but occupational exposure accelerated disease (without exposure, might not have developed symptomatic disease until 60s-70s)"

---

### Foundation's Position: Presumptive Coverage

**Policy Goal**: Workers with AATD who develop lung disease in high-risk occupations should receive workers' compensation

**Rationale**:

- **Genetic + Environmental = Disease**: AATD alone doesn't cause disease—requires "second hit" (smoking, occupational exposure, infection)
- **Accelerated Disease**: Occupational exposures cause disease to develop earlier, faster, more severe
- **But-For Test**: "But for" occupational exposure, worker would not have developed symptomatic disease at this age
- **Fairness**: Worker took high-risk job (firefighter, miner, welder) → exposed to hazards → developed disease → deserves compensation

**Model Policy**: "Presumptive Workers' Compensation for AATD-Related Occupational Lung Disease"

**Key Provisions**:

1. If worker has AATD + develops lung disease (COPD, emphysema) while employed in high-risk occupation → **presumed work-related**
2. Burden of proof on employer (to prove disease NOT work-related)
3. High-risk occupations: Firefighting, mining, welding, chemical manufacturing, construction, military

---

### State Workers' Comp Advocacy

**Strategy**:

**1. Legislative Approach**:

- State legislation: "Presumptive Workers' Comp for Firefighters with AATD" (start with firefighters—easiest case)
- Example: Similar to cancer presumption laws (many states presume cancer in firefighters is work-related)

**2. Regulatory Approach**:

- State workers' comp board rulemaking (some states allow regulatory changes without legislation)

**3. Case-by-Case Advocacy**:

- Support individual workers' comp cases (expert witness testimony, medical evidence, legal support)
- Build case law (precedent for future cases)

**Target States**: Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio (mining states, strong labor unions)

---

## Employer Engagement

### Voluntary Screening Programs

**Goal**: Encourage employers to offer voluntary AATD screening

**Target Employers**:

- Fire departments
- Mining companies
- Manufacturing companies (chemical, refining)
- Construction companies

**Value Proposition for Employers**:

- ✅ **Healthier Workforce**: Early detection → treatment or career change → healthier workers
- ✅ **Reduced Workers' Comp Costs**: Early intervention reduces long-term claims (prevent advanced disease)
- ✅ **Employee Retention**: Accommodation (not termination) → retain experienced workers
- ✅ **Corporate Social Responsibility**: Demonstrate commitment to worker health + safety

**Foundation Support**:

- Free or subsidized testing (Foundation pays for tests)
- Genetic counseling (Foundation provides counselors)
- Education materials (for employers + employees)
- Technical assistance (program design, implementation)

---

### Workplace Accommodations

**Goal**: Help employers accommodate workers with AATD

**Accommodations** (Examples):

- **Firefighters**: Transfer to fire prevention, training, EMS, administrative role
- **Miners**: Transfer to surface operations, equipment maintenance, safety roles
- **Welders**: Transfer to less-exposure role (supervisor, quality control, training)
- **Manufacturing**: Transfer to lower-exposure area, improved ventilation, respiratory protection

**Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)**:

- AATD may qualify as disability under ADA (if substantially limits major life activity—breathing)
- Employers must provide reasonable accommodations (unless undue hardship)

---
