## Insurance Landscape

### Current Coverage Environment

**What's Covered (Generally)**:

- ✅ **AATD Testing**: AAT level blood test covered by most insurance (Medicare, Medicaid, commercial)
- ✅ **Genetic Testing**: Genotyping (Pi*Z, Pi*S alleles) covered when medically necessary
- ✅ **Augmentation Therapy**: Covered by Medicare, most Medicaid, most commercial insurance (IF criteria met)
- ✅ **Standard COPD Care**: Inhalers, pulmonary rehab, oxygen (standard coverage)

**Coverage Gaps & Barriers**:

- ❌ **Prior Authorization**: Augmentation therapy requires prior auth (30-90 day delays)
- ❌ **Step Therapy**: Some plans require "fail first" (try cheaper treatments before augmentation therapy)
- ❌ **High Cost-Sharing**: Copays for augmentation therapy can be $500-$2,000/month (unaffordable)
- ❌ **Network Restrictions**: Limited to certain infusion centers, providers
- ❌ **Testing Under-Utilized**: Even when covered, providers don't order test (awareness problem, not coverage)
- ❌ **Family Testing**: Cascade screening (genetic testing for relatives) often denied as "not medically necessary"

---

### Key Payers

**Medicare** (Federal, 65+ or disabled):

- Covers AATD testing, augmentation therapy (if criteria met)
- Part B (medical) or Part D (pharmacy) depending on product
- Challenge: Prior authorization through Medicare Advantage plans (not traditional Medicare)

**Medicaid** (State-Federal, low-income):

- Coverage varies by state
- Challenge: Prior authorization, limited provider networks, coverage denials

**Commercial Insurance** (Employer-sponsored, individual market):

- Most plans cover AATD testing + treatment
- Challenge: High deductibles, copays, prior authorization, step therapy

**Self-Pay/Uninsured**:

- AATD testing: $50-$300 (affordable)
- Augmentation therapy: $100K-$200K/year (unaffordable—need patient assistance programs)

---

## Coverage Barriers

### Barrier 1: Prior Authorization for Augmentation Therapy 🔥

**The Problem**:

- **What**: Insurance requires provider to submit detailed paperwork + medical records before approving augmentation therapy
- **Timeline**: 30-90 days (sometimes longer)
- **Impact**: Delayed treatment → lung function declines (irreversible damage)
- **Burden**: Providers spend hours on paperwork (some refuse to prescribe due to admin burden)

**Clinical Criteria (Typical)**:

1. AAT level <11 µM (57 mg/dL)
2. Pi*ZZ, Pi*SZ, or other high-risk genotype
3. Lung disease (FEV1 30-65% predicted OR radiographic evidence of emphysema)
4. Non-smoker (or quit smoking >6 months ago)

**Why Prior Auth is Problematic**:

- Criteria are objective (easy to verify—why delay?)
- Augmentation therapy is evidence-based (ATS/ERS guidelines recommend)
- Delays harm patients (lung damage is irreversible)

**Foundation's Position**: **Eliminate prior authorization** for augmentation therapy when clinical criteria clearly met (AAT <11 µM + high-risk genotype + non-smoker).

---

### Barrier 2: Step Therapy (Fail First)

**The Problem**:

- **What**: Some insurers require patients to try cheaper treatments (inhalers, oxygen) and "fail" before approving augmentation therapy
- **Impact**: Delayed treatment (3-6 months or longer)
- **Medical Logic**: Flawed—augmentation therapy is not a "last resort," it's a disease-modifying treatment (like insulin for diabetes)

**Foundation's Position**: **Eliminate step therapy** for augmentation therapy. It's not a stepwise treatment—it's replacement therapy for genetic protein deficiency.

---

### Barrier 3: High Cost-Sharing

**The Problem**:

- **What**: Even when covered, patient copays/coinsurance can be $500-$2,000/month (augmentation therapy)
- **Impact**: Treatment non-adherence (patients skip infusions due to cost)
- **Who's Affected**: Patients with high-deductible plans, commercial insurance

**Current Solutions**:

- Pharmaceutical patient assistance programs (PAPs): Grifols, CSL Behring, Takeda, Baxter, Octapharma offer copay assistance
- Challenge: Not all patients aware of PAPs, application process burdensome

**Foundation's Role**:

- **Connect patients to PAPs** (patient navigation)
- **Advocate for copay caps** (state-level legislation limiting out-of-pocket costs for specialty drugs)

---

### Barrier 4: Network Restrictions

**The Problem**:

- **What**: Insurance limits augmentation therapy to certain infusion centers (some remote, inconvenient)
- **Impact**: Travel burden (patients drive 1-2 hours for weekly infusions)
- **Who's Affected**: Rural patients, patients with limited transportation

**Foundation's Position**: **Expand access** to home infusion (when clinically appropriate), telemedicine oversight (reduce travel).

---

### Barrier 5: Cascade Screening Denials

**The Problem**:

- **What**: After one family member diagnosed with AATD, genetic testing for relatives (cascade screening) often denied as "not medically necessary"
- **Medical Logic**: Flawed—AATD is genetic (50% chance siblings have same genotype), early detection critical
- **Impact**: Missed diagnoses (family members remain undiagnosed until symptomatic)

**Foundation's Position**: **Mandate coverage** for cascade screening (first-degree relatives of AATD patients).

---

## Advocacy Priorities

### Priority 1: Eliminate Prior Authorization for Augmentation Therapy 🔥

**Goal**: Automatic approval when clinical criteria met

**Strategy**:

**1. Federal Level**:

- **CMS Rulemaking**: Comment on proposed rules (request prior auth elimination or expedited review)
- **Congressional Oversight**: Request hearing on prior authorization burdens (focus on rare diseases)

**2. State Level**:

- **State Legislation**: Model bill: "AATD Treatment Access Act" (eliminate prior auth)
- **Target States**: Texas, Florida, California (Tier 1 states)

**3. Payer Engagement**:

- **Direct Outreach**: Meet with medical directors of major insurers (present evidence: delays harm patients, prior auth doesn't save money)
- **Clinical Guidelines**: Leverage ATS/ERS guidelines (recommend augmentation therapy—no mention of "fail first")

**4. Provider Advocacy**:

- **Medical Societies**: Engage American Thoracic Society (ATS), American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) to advocate for prior auth reform

---

### Priority 2: Eliminate Step Therapy

**Goal**: Remove "fail first" requirements for augmentation therapy

**Strategy**:

**1. State Step Therapy Reform Bills**:

- Many states considering step therapy reform (not AATD-specific, but would help AATD patients)
- Support coalitions advocating for reform (patient groups, medical societies)

**2. Payer Education**:

- Educate payers: Augmentation therapy is not a "last resort"—it's disease-modifying, replacement therapy
- Clinical evidence: Augmentation therapy slows lung function decline (evidence-based)

**3. Clinical Guideline Leverage**:

- ATS/ERS guidelines do not recommend step therapy (use guidelines to challenge denials)

---

### Priority 3: Copay Cap Advocacy

**Goal**: State-level legislation capping out-of-pocket costs for specialty drugs

**Status**:

- Several states have passed or considering copay cap legislation (not AATD-specific, but would benefit AATD patients)
- Example: Colorado caps specialty drug copays at $250/month

**Strategy**:

- **Coalition Approach**: Join coalitions advocating for copay caps (patient groups for chronic diseases—cancer, MS, diabetes, etc.)
- **AATD Stories**: Share patient stories (can't afford augmentation therapy, skip infusions, lung function declines)

**Target States**: California, New York, Massachusetts (progressive health policies)

---

### Priority 4: Cascade Screening Coverage Mandate

**Goal**: Require insurance to cover genetic testing for first-degree relatives of AATD patients

**Strategy**:

**1. Federal Level**:

- **CMS Coverage Decision**: Request National Coverage Determination (NCD) for cascade screening
- **Evidence**: Cost-effectiveness studies (cascade screening is highly cost-effective for genetic diseases)

**2. State Level**:

- **State Legislation**: Model bill requiring coverage (like some states mandate BRCA testing for breast cancer families)

**3. Payer Engagement**:

- **Direct Outreach**: Present evidence to payers (cascade screening identifies cases early, reduces long-term costs)

---

## Payer Engagement Strategy

### Target Payers

**Tier 1 (Years 1-2)**:

- Medicare (CMS)
- Top 5 commercial insurers: UnitedHealthcare, Anthem (BCBS), Aetna, Cigna, Humana
- Top 3 Medicaid MCOs: Centene, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan, Anthem Medicaid

**Tier 2 (Years 3-5)**:

- Regional insurers (Blue Cross Blue Shield state plans)
- PBMs (Pharmacy Benefit Managers): CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, OptumRx
- Self-insured employers (Fortune 500 companies)

---

### Engagement Tactics

**1. Medical Director Meetings**:

- **Who**: Foundation leadership (Executive Director, Medical Director, patient advocate)
- **Purpose**: Educate about AATD, present evidence (diagnostic delays, coverage barriers), request policy changes
- **Ask**: Eliminate prior auth, expedite reviews, cover cascade screening

**2. Payer Advisory Boards**:

- **What**: Some insurers have patient/provider advisory boards
- **Goal**: Get AATD patient or provider on board (inside voice)

**3. Clinical Evidence Submissions**:

- **What**: Submit formal evidence packets to payers (clinical guidelines, cost-effectiveness studies, patient testimonials)
- **Outcome**: Influence coverage policies

**4. Collaborative Problem-Solving**:

- **Approach**: Partner with payers (not adversarial)
- **Example**: Pilot program—payer + Foundation collaborate on AATD patient navigation (demonstrate improved outcomes, reduced costs)

---

### Evidence Package for Payers

**Prepare Standardized Evidence Packet**:

1. **Clinical Overview**:
   - What is AATD? (prevalence, genetics, natural history)
   - Diagnostic delay problem (7-8 years average)
   - Treatment options (augmentation therapy, standard COPD care)

2. **Clinical Guidelines**:
   - ATS/ERS guidelines (recommend augmentation therapy for AAT <11 µM + lung disease)
   - No mention of step therapy or "fail first"

3. **Cost-Effectiveness**:
   - Studies showing augmentation therapy is cost-effective (slows disease, reduces hospitalizations, improves quality of life)
   - Early diagnosis saves $$ (prevents advanced disease)

4. **Coverage Barriers**:
   - Prior auth delays (average 60 days)
   - Step therapy is inappropriate (replacement therapy, not last resort)
   - High copays → non-adherence

5. **Proposed Solutions**:
   - Eliminate prior auth (or auto-approve when criteria met)
   - Eliminate step therapy
   - Cover cascade screening
   - Copay assistance programs (partner with Foundation)

6. **Patient Stories**:
   - 3-5 patient testimonials (diagnostic delay, coverage barriers, impact on life)

---

## Patient Support

### Insurance Navigation Services

**Program**: AATD Insurance Navigation (part of Patient Services program)

**Services**:

1. **Coverage Verification**:
   - Help patients understand their insurance coverage (what's covered, copays, prior auth requirements)

2. **Prior Authorization Support**:
   - Assist providers with prior auth paperwork (gather medical records, complete forms)
   - Follow up with insurance (expedite reviews)

3. **Appeal Assistance**:
   - If coverage denied → help patient appeal (write appeal letter, gather supporting evidence)
   - Medical necessity letters (template letters for providers)

4. **Patient Assistance Program (PAP) Connections**:
   - Connect patients to pharmaceutical PAPs (Grifols, CSL Behring, Takeda, Baxter, Octapharma)
   - Help complete PAP applications

5. **Financial Assistance**:
   - Foundation's Patient Assistance Microgrants (for copays, testing costs—see Microgrants Program)

### Denial Tracking

**Goal**: Track insurance denials + appeals (identify patterns, inform advocacy)

**Data to Collect**:

- Payer (insurance company)
- Denial reason (prior auth denied, step therapy required, "not medically necessary," etc.)
- Appeal outcome (approved, denied, pending)
- Time to resolution (days from denial to approval)

**Use Data For**:

- **Payer Engagement**: "Your company denies augmentation therapy 40% of the time—this is harming patients"
- **Policy Advocacy**: Evidence for state/federal legislation
- **Patient Support**: Identify problematic payers (provide extra support to patients with those insurers)

---

## Policy Interventions

### Federal Policy

**1. CMS Coverage Policies**:

- **National Coverage Determination (NCD)**: Request CMS issue NCD for AATD (standardize coverage across Medicare)
- **Prior Auth Reform**: Comment on CMS proposed rules (request prior auth elimination or expedited review)

**2. Congressional Action**:

- **Support Federal Prior Auth Reform Bills**: Several bills introduced to reform prior authorization (not AATD-specific, but would help)
- **Oversight Hearings**: Request hearing on prior auth delays for rare disease treatments

---

### State Policy

**1. Prior Authorization Reform**:

- **Model Legislation**: "Prior Authorization Reform Act" (expedite reviews, require electronic submissions, transparency)
- **AATD-Specific**: "AATD Treatment Access Act" (eliminate prior auth for augmentation therapy when criteria met)

**2. Step Therapy Reform**:

- **Model Legislation**: "Step Therapy Override Act" (allow providers to override step therapy if medically inappropriate)

**3. Copay Caps**:

- **Model Legislation**: "Specialty Drug Copay Cap Act" (cap monthly copays at $X, e.g., $250)

**4. Cascade Screening Mandate**:

- **Model Legislation**: Require coverage of genetic testing for first-degree relatives of AATD patients

---

### Employer Engagement

**Goal**: Improve AATD coverage in employer-sponsored plans

**Target**: Self-insured employers (Fortune 500, large companies)

**Strategy**:

1. **Education**:
   - Educate HR benefits managers about AATD (prevalence, coverage barriers, employee impact)

2. **Case Study**:
   - Demonstrate: Improving AATD coverage = healthier employees, lower long-term costs (prevent hospitalizations)

3. **Model Plan Design**:
   - Provide model plan language (eliminate prior auth, cover cascade screening, copay assistance)

4. **Employee Resource Groups**:
   - Connect with employee resource groups (health advocacy groups within companies)
