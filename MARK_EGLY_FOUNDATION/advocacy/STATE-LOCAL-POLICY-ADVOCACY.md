## State Policy Landscape

### Why State Policy Matters for AATD

**States Control**:

- ✅ **Newborn screening programs** (each state decides which conditions to screen)
- ✅ **Medicaid coverage** (states set coverage policies within federal guidelines)
- ✅ **Insurance regulations** (states regulate health insurance—coverage mandates, prior authorization)
- ✅ **Public health programs** (disease surveillance, screening programs, awareness campaigns)
- ✅ **Occupational health** (workers' compensation, workplace safety—relevant for firefighters, military)
- ✅ **Medical education** (state medical boards, CME requirements)

**State Wins = Faster Progress**:

- Easier than federal (50 state legislatures vs. 1 Congress)
- Laboratories for innovation (test policies in one state, then replicate)
- Immediate impact (state laws take effect quickly)

---

### State Policy Environment for AATD

**Current State**:

- ❌ **No state mandates AATD screening** (for COPD patients, at-risk populations)
- ❌ **Inconsistent Medicaid coverage** (prior authorization varies wildly by state)
- ❌ **No state newborn screening** (except voluntary programs in a few states)
- ✅ **Some state rare disease councils** (advisory bodies—opportunity to engage)
- ✅ **Genetic privacy laws** (some states stronger than federal GINA)

**Opportunity**:

- Low-hanging fruit (states not opposed, just unaware)
- AATD is bipartisan (not politically divisive)
- Patient stories are powerful (legislators respond to constituents)

---

## Priority States

### Tier 1 States (Years 1-3) 🔥

**Selection Criteria**:

- Large AATD patient population (or high undiagnosed rate)
- Favorable political environment (history of rare disease legislation)
- Foundation presence (board members, donors, staff, or strong patient advocates)
- Potential for replication (success here can inspire other states)

**Tier 1 States**:

1. **Florida**:
   - **Why**: Mark Egly's home state, strong Foundation presence, large population, aging demographics
   - **Priority**: AATD testing mandate for COPD patients
   - **Champion**: Identify state legislator (patient connection)

2. **California**:
   - **Why**: Largest population, progressive health policies, strong rare disease advocacy
   - **Priority**: Newborn screening for AATD (pilot program)
   - **Champion**: Partner with California Rare Disease Coalition

3. **Texas**:
   - **Why**: Second-largest population, strong patient advocacy network, business-friendly
   - **Priority**: Medicaid prior authorization reform (eliminate barriers to augmentation therapy)
   - **Champion**: Partner with Texas Rare Disease Coalition

4. **New York**:
   - **Why**: Large population, progressive health policies, strong patient advocacy
   - **Priority**: Genetic privacy protections (expand beyond GINA)
   - **Champion**: Partner with Genetic Alliance NY chapter

5. **Pennsylvania**:
   - **Why**: High COPD prevalence, Rust Belt state (occupational exposures), strong rare disease advocacy
   - **Priority**: Firefighter AATD screening mandate
   - **Champion**: Partner with firefighter unions, PA Rare Disease Coalition

---

### Tier 2 States (Years 3-5)

**Selection Criteria**: High COPD prevalence, geographic diversity, replication opportunities

**Tier 2 States**:

- Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, Massachusetts, Washington, Virginia, Colorado

**Strategy**: Learn from Tier 1 wins, replicate successful policies

---

## State Legislative Priorities

### Priority 1: AATD Testing Mandate for COPD Patients 🔥

**Model Legislation**: "AATD Early Detection Act" (state version)

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Testing Requirement**:
   - All individuals newly diagnosed with COPD must be offered AATD testing (AAT level + genotype)
   - Healthcare providers must document:
     - Test offered (yes/no)
     - Patient accepted or declined
     - Test results (if accepted)

2. **Insurance Coverage**:
   - All health insurance plans (including Medicaid) must cover AATD testing for COPD patients (no cost-sharing, no prior authorization)

3. **Provider Education**:
   - State health department to develop and disseminate AATD provider education materials
   - CME credit available (optional but encouraged)

4. **Data Collection**:
   - State health department to track:
     - # COPD patients diagnosed (annually)
     - # AATD tests performed
     - # AATD cases identified
     - Diagnostic delay (time from symptom onset to AATD diagnosis)

**Rationale**:

- 50%+ of AATD patients misdiagnosed with COPD
- Simple test (blood test, widely available)
- Cost-effective (early diagnosis prevents costly complications)
- Patient autonomy (test offered, not forced)

**Political Strategy**:

- **Bipartisan**: Health issue, not political
- **Coalition**: Partner with COPD Foundation, American Lung Association, rare disease groups
- **Champions**: Legislators with COPD or AATD constituents
- **Testimonials**: AATD patients share diagnostic delay stories

**First State Target**: Florida (Mark's home state, strong Foundation presence)

**Timeline**:

- **2026**: Draft legislation, identify champion
- **2027**: Introduce bill, committee hearings
- **2028**: Floor vote, passage (aspirational)
- **2029**: Implementation, track outcomes

---

### Priority 2: Medicaid Prior Authorization Reform

**Problem**:

- Many states require prior authorization for augmentation therapy (Prolastin, Aralast, Zemaira, Glassia)
- Prior auth delays treatment 30-90 days (lung function declines)
- Burdensome paperwork (providers, patients)

**Model Policy**: "AATD Augmentation Therapy Access Act"

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Eliminate Prior Authorization**:
   - Medicaid must cover augmentation therapy without prior authorization IF:
     - AAT level <11 µM (57 mg/dL)
     - Genotype: Pi*ZZ, Pi*SZ, or other high-risk genotype
     - Non-smoker (or quit smoking >6 months ago)
   - If criteria met → automatic approval

2. **Expedited Review** (for edge cases):
   - If patient doesn't meet all criteria but provider believes treatment necessary → expedited review (7 days max)

3. **Annual Review**:
   - State Medicaid agency to report annually:
     - # augmentation therapy prescriptions
     - Average time from prescription to first infusion
     - Denials (# and reasons)

**Rationale**:

- Delays harm patients (irreversible lung damage)
- Criteria are clear (easy to verify)
- Reduces administrative burden (saves Medicaid $$)

**First State Target**: Texas (large Medicaid population, strong patient advocacy)

**Timeline**:

- **2027**: Draft policy, identify champion
- **2028**: Introduce bill or rulemaking petition
- **2029**: Policy change (aspirational)

---

### Priority 3: Newborn Screening for AATD

**Goal**: Add AATD to state newborn screening panel

**Strategy**:

- Long-term (5-10 years—complex policy change)
- Pilot program first (demonstrate feasibility, benefits)

**Model Program**: "AATD Newborn Screening Pilot" (California target)

**Key Components**:

1. **Voluntary Pilot** (2-3 years):
   - Partner with 5-10 hospitals
   - Offer AATD screening to all newborns (opt-out)
   - Track:
     - Prevalence (how many babies have AATD?)
     - Parental acceptance (opt-out rate)
     - Follow-up outcomes (do families use information?)

2. **Genetic Counseling**:
   - All AATD-positive babies → genetic counseling for parents
   - Education: What is AATD? What does it mean for our child? Cascade screening (test siblings, parents)

3. **Long-Term Follow-Up**:
   - Track health outcomes (do early-detected children have better outcomes?)
   - Build evidence base for statewide screening

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Cost-benefit analysis
   - Ethical considerations (genetic privacy, insurance discrimination)
   - Stakeholder input (parents, providers, ethicists)

**If Pilot Successful**:

- Submit application to state health department (add AATD to statewide newborn screening panel)
- Present evidence: Pilot results, medical advisory committee recommendation, parent testimonials

**First State Target**: California (progressive health policies, large population, strong infrastructure)

**Timeline**:

- **2027**: Design pilot, secure funding ($500K-$1M)
- **2028-2030**: Pilot implementation
- **2031**: Evaluation, statewide application
- **2032+**: Statewide screening (if successful)

---

### Priority 4: Firefighter AATD Screening

**Problem**:

- Firefighters exposed to smoke, toxins (accelerates AATD lung disease)
- Many firefighters have AATD but don't know it
- Early retirement, disability, death (preventable with early detection)

**Model Legislation**: "Firefighter AATD Screening Act"

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Pre-Employment Screening**:
   - All new firefighter candidates must be offered AATD testing (AAT level + genotype)
   - Optional (not mandatory—avoid discrimination concerns)
   - Paid for by fire department or state

2. **Active Firefighter Screening**:
   - All active firefighters offered AATD testing (one-time or periodic)
   - Voluntary

3. **Genetic Privacy**:
   - AATD test results confidential (cannot be used for hiring, firing, or assignment decisions)
   - Exception: Firefighter can voluntarily disclose to request accommodations

4. **Workers' Compensation**:
   - If firefighter has AATD + develops lung disease → presumed work-related (eligible for workers' comp)

5. **Education**:
   - Fire departments to provide AATD education (what it is, why screening matters, treatment options)

**Rationale**:

- Firefighters = high-risk occupation (smoke exposure)
- Early detection = career planning (avoid further exposures)
- Life-saving (treatment + lifestyle changes)

**Coalition Partners**:

- International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF)
- National Volunteer Fire Council (NVFC)
- State firefighter unions

**First State Target**: Pennsylvania (Rust Belt, strong firefighter unions, rare disease advocacy)

**Timeline**:

- **2028**: Draft legislation, engage firefighter unions
- **2029**: Introduce bill
- **2030**: Passage (aspirational)

---

### Priority 5: Genetic Privacy Protections

**Problem**:

- GINA (federal law) prohibits genetic discrimination in health insurance + employment
- But GINA does NOT cover: Life insurance, disability insurance, long-term care insurance
- AATD patients denied coverage or charged higher premiums

**Model Legislation**: "Genetic Privacy Act" (state version)

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Expand Protections**:
   - Prohibit life insurance, disability insurance, long-term care insurance from:
     - Requiring genetic testing
     - Using genetic information to deny coverage or set premiums

2. **Exceptions**:
   - Life insurance policies >$X (e.g., >$500K) may use genetic information (balance consumer protection with insurance industry concerns)

3. **Enforcement**:
   - State insurance commissioner to enforce
   - Private right of action (individuals can sue for violations)

**First State Target**: New York (progressive, strong genetic privacy laws already)

**Timeline**:

- **2028-2029**: Draft legislation, coalition building
- **2030**: Introduce bill
- **2031+**: Passage (long-term goal)

---

## State Agency Engagement

### State Health Departments

**Goal**: Partner with state health departments on AATD initiatives

**Opportunities**:

1. **AATD Awareness Campaigns**:
   - Partner on COPD awareness campaigns (add AATD messaging)
   - Example: "Know Your ABCs: Asthma, Bronchitis, COPD... and AATD"

2. **Provider Education**:
   - State health department distributes AATD provider toolkits (CME credit)

3. **Data Collection**:
   - Add AATD to state rare disease registries (if exists)
   - Track prevalence, diagnostic delays, outcomes

**Target States**: Florida, California, Texas (Tier 1)

---

### State Medicaid Agencies

**Goal**: Improve Medicaid coverage for AATD

**Tactics**:

1. **Coverage Review**:
   - Request Medicaid agency review AATD coverage policies
   - Submit formal comments (identify barriers, propose solutions)

2. **Pilot Programs**:
   - Propose AATD patient navigation pilot (Medicaid pays for navigator services—demonstrate cost savings)

3. **Quality Metrics**:
   - Propose AATD quality metrics for Medicaid managed care plans:
     - % COPD patients tested for AATD
     - Average time from prescription to augmentation therapy
     - AATD patient outcomes (hospitalizations, ER visits)

---

### State Insurance Departments

**Goal**: Reduce insurance barriers (prior authorization, coverage denials)

**Tactics**:

1. **Consumer Complaints**:
   - Encourage AATD patients to file complaints with state insurance department (document problems)
   - Aggregate complaints → evidence for policy change

2. **Coverage Mandates**:
   - Propose state insurance coverage mandate (all plans must cover AATD testing + treatment)

3. **Prior Authorization Reform**:
   - Support state-level prior authorization reform bills (not AATD-specific, but would help AATD patients)

---

## Local Policy Opportunities

### City/County Health Departments

**Goal**: Local AATD screening + awareness initiatives

**Opportunities**:

1. **Community Health Fairs**:
   - Partner with city/county health departments on health fairs (offer AATD screening)

2. **COPD Programs**:
   - Integrate AATD education into existing COPD programs (pulmonary rehab, smoking cessation)

3. **Vulnerable Populations**:
   - Target underserved communities (high COPD prevalence, low diagnosis rates)

**Target Cities**: Miami, Los Angeles, Houston, New York City, Philadelphia (large populations, existing health infrastructure)

---

### Fire Departments (Local)

**Goal**: Firefighter AATD screening programs (even without state mandate)

**Strategy**:

1. **Pilot Programs**:
   - Partner with 3-5 fire departments (offer free AATD screening to all firefighters)
   - Track results (prevalence, firefighter acceptance, outcomes)

2. **Union Engagement**:
   - Work with local firefighter unions (education, advocacy)

3. **Workers' Comp Integration**:
   - If firefighter diagnosed with AATD → help navigate workers' comp (if lung disease develops)

**Target Cities**: Phoenix, Denver, Portland, Seattle (firefighter-friendly cities, progressive health policies)

---

### School Districts

**Goal**: AATD education in schools (raise awareness among future healthcare providers, patients)

**Opportunities**:

1. **Health Education Curriculum**:
   - Partner with school districts to integrate AATD into health education (high school biology, health classes)

2. **Genetic Literacy**:
   - AATD as case study for genetic disease education

3. **Career Awareness**:
   - For students interested in healthcare careers (medical, nursing, respiratory therapy schools)

---

## Grassroots Mobilization

### Patient Advocates

**Goal**: Train and mobilize AATD patient advocates in every state

**Strategy**:

**Year 1-2**: Train 50 advocates (focus on Tier 1 states)

- Advocacy training workshops (how to tell your story, meet with legislators, write op-eds)
- Toolkit: One-pagers, talking points, sample letters

**Year 3-5**: Expand to 100+ advocates (all 50 states)

- Train-the-trainer model (experienced advocates train new advocates)
- Virtual training (accessible to all)

**Advocate Activities**:

- Meet with state legislators (district offices, state capitol)
- Testify at committee hearings
- Write op-eds, letters to editor
- Social media advocacy
- Media interviews (local TV, radio, newspapers)

---

### Local Advocacy Days

**Event**: "AATD Advocacy Day at State Capitol"

**Model**: Similar to federal Advocacy Day, but state-level

**Schedule**:

- **Morning**: Advocacy training (for first-time advocates)
- **Midday**: Capitol visits (meetings with legislators, staff)
- **Afternoon**: Press conference (patient stories, legislative ask)

**Target States**: Florida (2027), California (2028), Texas (2029)

**Budget**: $10K per state (travel stipends for advocates, materials, venue)

---

### Coalition Building (State-Level)

**Join State Coalitions**:

- State rare disease coalitions (most states have one)
- State lung disease coalitions
- State genetic counselor associations

**Build AATD-Specific Coalitions**:

- State AATD coalitions (patients + providers + advocates)
- Example: "Florida AATD Alliance"
