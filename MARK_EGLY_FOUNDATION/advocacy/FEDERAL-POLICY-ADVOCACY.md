## Federal Policy Landscape

### Current Federal Context for AATD

**Strengths**:

- ✅ NIH funds some AATD research (limited, competitive)
- ✅ FDA regulates augmentation therapy (4 approved products)
- ✅ Medicare/Medicaid covers AATD testing and treatment (with limitations)
- ✅ Rare disease designation (AATD is recognized as rare disease)

**Gaps & Challenges**:

- ❌ **No federal AATD screening mandate** (unlike newborn screening for other genetic conditions)
- ❌ **Low research funding** (AATD is "rare" but not rare enough for Orphan Drug Act incentives in practice)
- ❌ **Insurance barriers** (prior authorization, step therapy, high copays for augmentation therapy)
- ❌ **Diagnostic delays not prioritized** (no federal initiative to reduce diagnostic delays)
- ❌ **Limited awareness among policymakers** (most don't know what AATD is)

---

### Federal Agencies Relevant to AATD

**1. National Institutes of Health (NIH)**:

- **Role**: Fund AATD research (basic, translational, clinical)
- **Key Institutes**: NHLBI (lung), NIDDK (liver), NICHD (pediatric), NIGMS (genetics)
- **Opportunity**: Increase AATD research funding

**2. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**:

- **Role**: Public health surveillance, disease prevention
- **Opportunity**: Add AATD to CDC rare disease tracking, promote screening

**3. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**:

- **Role**: Approve diagnostics, therapeutics, devices
- **Opportunity**: Expedited review for AATD diagnostics (AAT glucometer), new treatments

**4. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)**:

- **Role**: Reimbursement policies for testing, treatment
- **Opportunity**: Expand coverage, reduce prior authorization barriers

**5. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)**:

- **Role**: Healthcare workforce, underserved populations
- **Opportunity**: AATD patient navigation programs, community health center grants

**6. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)**:

- **Role**: Healthcare quality, patient safety, evidence-based practices
- **Opportunity**: AATD diagnostic delay research, quality improvement initiatives

## Legislative Priorities

### Priority 1: AATD Early Detection Act 🔥 (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Goal**: Federal legislation to improve early detection of AATD

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Targeted Screening Mandate**:
   - Require AATD testing for all individuals diagnosed with COPD (unless previously tested)
   - Rationale: 50%+ of AATD patients misdiagnosed with COPD; testing this population captures many undiagnosed

2. **Cascade Screening**:
   - Once one family member diagnosed, require insurance to cover genetic testing for first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children)
   - Rationale: AATD is genetic—testing family members identifies more cases

3. **Provider Education Funding**:
   - $5M/year to CDC or HRSA for AATD provider education (CME, toolkits, awareness campaigns)
   - Rationale: Providers don't test because they don't think of AATD—education increases detection

4. **Data Collection**:
   - Require CDC to track AATD prevalence, diagnostic delays, health outcomes
   - Rationale: Can't improve what you don't measure

**Status**: Draft legislation being developed (Year 1-2)

**Strategy**:

- Champion identification (find bipartisan congressional champion—ideally someone with personal AATD connection)
- Coalition building (partner with Alpha-1 Foundation, American Lung Association, rare disease coalitions)
- Patient stories (bring AATD patients to Capitol Hill to share diagnostic delay stories)

**Timeline**:

- **2026**: Draft bill, identify champion
- **2027**: Introduce bill in House and Senate
- **2028**: Committee hearings, advocacy push
- **2029**: Floor vote (if momentum)
- **2030**: Passage (aspirational)

---

### Priority 2: Rare Disease Research Funding Increase

**Goal**: Increase NIH funding for rare disease research (including AATD)

**Mechanism**: Congressional appropriations (annual budget process)

**Ask**:

- **NIH Rare Disease Research**: Increase by $100M/year
- **NHLBI AATD Program**: Dedicated $10M/year for AATD research (within NIH budget)

**Strategy**:

- Join rare disease coalitions (NORD, EveryLife Foundation, Genetic Alliance)
- Annual "Rare Disease Week" advocacy (February—Rare Disease Day)
- Congressional letters (ask Members of Congress to sign letter to Appropriations Committee)
- Senate/House Appropriations Committee testimony (submit written testimony, request speaking slot)

**Timeline**: Annual (every budget cycle)

---

### Priority 3: Medicare/Medicaid Coverage Expansion

**Goal**: Expand Medicare/Medicaid coverage for AATD services

**Specific Asks**:

1. **Eliminate Prior Authorization for Augmentation Therapy**:
   - Current: Many states require prior auth (delays treatment 30-90 days)
   - Proposed: Automatic approval if AAT level <11 µM (57 mg/dL) + ZZ or SZ genotype
   - Rationale: Delays harm patients (lung function declines)

2. **Cover Genetic Testing**:
   - Current: Some states don't cover genetic testing (only AAT level)
   - Proposed: Require coverage of genotyping (Pi*Z, Pi*S allele testing)
   - Rationale: Genotype determines eligibility for augmentation therapy

3. **Cover Patient Navigation**:
   - Proposed: Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement for AATD patient navigators
   - Rationale: Navigation reduces diagnostic delays, improves treatment adherence

**Mechanism**:

- CMS rulemaking (comment on proposed rules)
- Congressional oversight (ask Health Subcommittee to hold hearing on AATD coverage barriers)

**Timeline**:

- **2026**: Submit comment letters to CMS
- **2027**: Congressional hearing (if opportunity arises)
- **2028-2030**: Policy changes (if advocacy successful)

---

### Priority 4: Newborn Screening for AATD

**Goal**: Add AATD to federal Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP)

**Background**:

- **RUSP**: Federal advisory committee recommends which conditions should be included in state newborn screening programs
- **Current status**: AATD is NOT on RUSP (some states screen voluntarily, most don't)

**Rationale**:

- ✅ AATD is genetic (present at birth)
- ✅ Simple blood test (AAT level + genotype)
- ✅ Early detection enables:
  - Avoid smoking (prevent lung disease)
  - Avoid harmful occupations (dust, fumes)
  - Early treatment (if liver disease)
  - Family screening (cascade testing)

**Challenge**:

- ❌ No immediate treatment for most babies with AATD (unlike PKU, hypothyroidism)
- ❌ Ethical concerns (genetic information, insurance discrimination)
- ❌ High bar for RUSP inclusion (must meet evidence criteria)

**Strategy**:

- Long-term goal (5-10 years)
- Build evidence base (research studies showing benefit of early detection)
- Pilot programs (partner with 2-3 states to pilot newborn screening)
- Coalition building (pediatricians, genetic counselors, patient groups)

**Timeline**:

- **2026-2028**: Research + pilot programs
- **2029-2030**: RUSP application submitted
- **2031-2035**: RUSP review + decision (aspirational)

---

### Priority 5: Insurance Non-Discrimination Protections

**Goal**: Strengthen protections against genetic discrimination

**Background**:

- **GINA (Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, 2008)**: Prohibits health insurance + employment discrimination based on genetic information
- **Gap**: GINA does NOT cover life insurance, disability insurance, long-term care insurance

**Problem for AATD Patients**:

- Many patients denied life insurance or charged higher premiums after AATD diagnosis
- Discourages people from getting tested (fear of discrimination)

**Proposed Solution**:

- Expand GINA to cover life insurance, disability insurance, long-term care insurance
- Or: Pass separate "Genetic Privacy Act"

**Strategy**:

- Join existing coalitions (many rare disease groups face this issue)
- Patient stories (AATD patients denied life insurance)
- Bipartisan support (privacy is bipartisan issue)

**Timeline**:

- **2027-2030**: Advocacy campaign
- **2030+**: Legislation introduced (long-term goal)

---

## Regulatory Priorities

### Priority 1: FDA Fast Track for AATD Diagnostics

**Goal**: Expedited FDA review for novel AATD diagnostics

**Target**: AAT glucometer (Mark Egly's patent, US20220160847)

**Mechanism**:

- **FDA Fast Track Designation**: Expedites development and review of drugs/devices for serious conditions
- **FDA Breakthrough Device Designation**: Expedites devices that provide more effective treatment/diagnosis

**Strategy**:

- Meet with FDA (pre-submission meeting)
- Demonstrate: AATD is serious condition, diagnostic delay is significant problem, glucometer would improve early detection
- Submit Fast Track or Breakthrough Device application

**Timeline**:

- **2027**: FDA pre-submission meeting
- **2028**: Fast Track/Breakthrough Device designation (if glucometer development progresses)
- **2029-2030**: FDA approval (if device successful)

---

### Priority 2: CMS Coverage for Home Testing

**Goal**: Medicare/Medicaid coverage for home-based AATD testing

**Background**:

- Currently: AATD testing requires doctor's order + lab visit
- Proposed: Home-based testing (finger prick, mail to lab OR home glucometer)
- Benefit: Increases access (especially rural, underserved populations)

**Mechanism**:

- CMS National Coverage Determination (NCD) or Local Coverage Determination (LCD)

**Strategy**:

- Submit coverage application to CMS
- Provide evidence: Home testing is accurate, increases detection rates, cost-effective
- Coalition support: Patient groups, medical societies

**Timeline**:

- **2028**: Submit coverage application (once home testing validated)
- **2029**: CMS review
- **2030**: Coverage decision (aspirational)

---

### Priority 3: FDA Guidance on AATD Clinical Trials

**Goal**: FDA guidance document for AATD clinical trial design

**Need**:

- AATD is rare—small patient populations make traditional RCTs difficult
- Need FDA guidance on acceptable trial designs (adaptive trials, real-world evidence)

**Strategy**:

- Convene stakeholders (FDA, NIH, industry, patient groups)
- Develop consensus recommendations
- Submit to FDA (request guidance document)

**Timeline**:

- **2027-2028**: Stakeholder meetings
- **2029**: Submit recommendations to FDA
- **2030**: FDA publishes guidance (if successful)
