## Advocacy 101

### What is Advocacy?

**Advocacy** = Using your voice to influence decisions that affect your life and the lives of others

**Types of Advocacy**:

1. **Legislative Advocacy**: Influencing laws (federal, state, local)
2. **Regulatory Advocacy**: Influencing agency policies (FDA, CMS, CDC, etc.)
3. **Corporate Advocacy**: Influencing private sector (insurance companies, employers, pharma)
4. **Public Awareness**: Educating the public, raising awareness, changing perceptions

---

### Why Your Voice Matters

**Legislators Listen to Constituents**:

- You vote (they want your vote)
- You have lived experience (more powerful than statistics)
- You represent others (thousands of AATD patients can't be there—you speak for them)

**Personal Stories > Data**:

- Data is important (provides evidence)
- But stories are memorable (emotional connection)
- Example: "700,000 Americans have AATD" (statistic) vs. "I spent 7 years seeing doctors before anyone tested me for AATD—7 years of declining lung function, preventable damage" (story)

**You Don't Need to Be an Expert**:

- You're an expert on YOUR experience (that's what matters)
- Foundation staff can provide policy details, data, research
- Your job: Share your story, explain why policy matters to YOU

---

### Rights and Protections for Advocates

**You Have the Right To**:

- ✅ Meet with your elected officials (they work for YOU)
- ✅ Express your opinions (First Amendment—free speech)
- ✅ Petition your government (redress of grievances)
- ✅ Join advocacy organizations (freedom of association)

**501(c)(3) Advocacy Rules** (for Foundation):

- Nonprofits CAN advocate for policies (issue advocacy)
- Nonprofits CANNOT endorse political candidates or parties (partisan politics)
- Foundation can say: "We support AATD Early Detection Act" ✅
- Foundation CANNOT say: "Vote for Candidate X" ❌

**As an Individual**:

- You can do both (issue advocacy + partisan politics)
- When advocating on behalf of Foundation, stick to issues (not candidates)

---

## Telling Your Story

### Why Stories Matter

**Stories Are**:

- **Memorable**: People remember stories, not statistics
- **Relatable**: Humanize the issue (not abstract policy, but real people)
- **Persuasive**: Emotional connection → action

**Your Story Has Power**:

- You've lived with AATD (diagnostic delay, treatment challenges, daily impact)
- Legislators don't know what AATD is (you educate them)
- Your story makes policy personal (not theoretical—affects real constituents)

---

### Story Arc: The Three-Part Structure

**1. Life Before AATD Diagnosis** (Setup):

- Who you are (name, age, where you live, family, career)
- First symptoms (when did you notice something was wrong?)
- Diagnostic odyssey (how many doctors? how long? misdiagnoses?)

**2. The AATD Diagnosis** (Turning Point):

- How you were diagnosed (what led to the test?)
- Reaction (shock, relief, confusion, fear)
- Impact (how did it change your life?)

**3. Life After Diagnosis** (Resolution + Call to Action):

- Treatment (augmentation therapy, other treatments)
- Current status (managing disease, challenges)
- **Why policy matters** (how would [bill/policy] have helped you or will help others?)

---

### Sample Story Template

**Template: Diagnostic Delay Story**

> "My name is [Name], and I'm from [City, State]. I'm [age] years old, [married/parent/career].
>
> In [year], I started experiencing [symptoms—shortness of breath, fatigue, chronic cough]. I went to my primary care doctor, who diagnosed me with asthma. I tried inhalers, but they didn't help.
>
> Over the next [X years], I saw [X] different doctors—pulmonologists, allergists, even a cardiologist. I was told I had asthma, bronchitis, even anxiety. No one mentioned AATD. No one tested me.
>
> During those [X] years, my lung function declined from [X]% to [Y]%. I couldn't [play with my kids/work/climb stairs]. I felt like I was suffocating. I thought I was dying.
>
> Finally, in [year], a new pulmonologist ordered an alpha-1 antitrypsin test. Within a week, I had my answer: Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, Pi\*ZZ genotype. Severe AAT deficiency. I had never heard of it.
>
> I was relieved to have a diagnosis—but devastated. If I'd been diagnosed [X] years earlier, I could have started treatment sooner. I could have avoided [smoking/occupational exposures]. My lungs might be healthier today.
>
> That's why I'm here today. The [AATD Early Detection Act / other policy] would require doctors to test COPD patients for AATD. If this law had existed [X] years ago, I would have been diagnosed years earlier. My life would be different.
>
> Please support this legislation. Help ensure that no one else has to wait [X] years for a diagnosis like I did."

**Key Elements**:

- ✅ Personal (name, age, where you're from—humanize)
- ✅ Specific details (X years, X doctors, lung function %—make it real)
- ✅ Emotional (fear, frustration, relief—connect emotionally)
- ✅ Call to action (specific policy ask)
- ✅ Brief (2-3 minutes spoken, 1 page written)

---

### Do's and Don'ts

**Do**:

- ✅ Be authentic (speak from the heart, be yourself)
- ✅ Use plain language (no medical jargon—explain AATD in simple terms)
- ✅ Be specific (numbers, timelines, details make story credible)
- ✅ Connect to policy (explain WHY this policy matters for your story)
- ✅ Practice (rehearse your story—know your key points)

**Don't**:

- ❌ Be preachy (don't lecture—share your experience)
- ❌ Be too technical (legislators aren't doctors—keep it simple)
- ❌ Be too long (2-3 minutes max for verbal, 1 page for written)
- ❌ Attack (don't blame doctors, insurance companies, etc.—focus on solutions)
- ❌ Forget the ask (always end with specific policy request)

---

## Meeting with Legislators

### Before the Meeting

**1. Schedule the Meeting**:

- Call or email legislator's office (ask for scheduler or health policy staffer)
- Message: "I'm a constituent with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency. I'd like to meet with [Legislator] to discuss [AATD Early Detection Act / other policy]."
- Offer: In-person (district office or Capitol) or virtual (Zoom)
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks in advance (legislators' schedules fill up)

**2. Prepare**:

- Research: What committees is legislator on? Have they supported rare disease bills?
- Materials: Bring one-pagers (AATD 101, policy summary—Foundation provides)
- Your story: Practice telling your story (2-3 minutes)
- The ask: Know exactly what you're asking for (co-sponsor bill, vote yes, etc.)

**3. Bring Support**:

- Not required, but helpful: Bring 1-2 other advocates (strength in numbers)
- Or: Foundation staff (if available—policy expertise)

---

### During the Meeting

**Meeting Structure** (typical 15-30 minutes):

**1. Introductions** (2 minutes):

- "Thank you for meeting with us. My name is [Name], I'm from [City], and I'm a constituent."
- Introduce others (if applicable)

**2. Tell Your Story** (3-5 minutes):

- Use story arc (life before, diagnosis, life after)
- Connect to policy (why this matters)

**3. Explain the Policy** (3-5 minutes):

- Brief overview (what is the bill/policy?)
- Key provisions (1-3 bullet points)
- Impact (how many people affected? cost? outcomes?)
- **Foundation staff can cover this part** (if present)

**4. The Ask** (1 minute):

- Be specific: "Will you co-sponsor the AATD Early Detection Act?"
- Or: "Will you vote yes when this bill comes to the floor?"
- Or: "Will you meet with [agency] to discuss AATD screening?"

**5. Listen + Respond** (5-10 minutes):

- Legislator or staff may ask questions (answer if you can, or defer to Foundation staff)
- They may express concerns (listen, acknowledge, address if possible)
- They may commit (great!) or say they'll "look into it" (follow up later)

**6. Thank You + Follow-Up** (1 minute):

- Thank them for their time
- Leave materials (one-pagers, business card)
- Ask: "What's the best way to follow up?" (email? call? staffer's name?)

---

### Meeting Tips

**Do**:

- ✅ Be respectful (even if you disagree with legislator on other issues)
- ✅ Be concise (legislators are busy—get to the point)
- ✅ Be positive (focus on solutions, not just problems)
- ✅ Listen (don't just talk—hear their concerns)
- ✅ Take notes (write down what they said—useful for follow-up)

**Don't**:

- ❌ Be confrontational (you want them on your side—adversarial approach backfires)
- ❌ Lie or exaggerate (credibility is everything—stick to facts)
- ❌ Argue (if they disagree, acknowledge + move on—don't debate)
- ❌ Bring huge group (3-5 people max—too many overwhelming)

---

### After the Meeting

**1. Thank You Note** (within 24-48 hours):

- Email or handwritten note
- Thank them for meeting
- Reiterate your ask
- Provide any information they requested

**2. Report Back**:

- Let Foundation know how it went (what did legislator say? did they commit?)
- Foundation tracks advocacy meetings (informs strategy)

**3. Follow Up**:

- If legislator said "I'll look into it" → follow up in 2-4 weeks
- If bill moves forward → thank them + provide updates
- If bill passes → celebrate + thank them publicly (social media, letter to editor)

---

## Media Engagement

### Why Media Matters

**Media Amplifies Your Voice**:

- Reach thousands (or millions) of people
- Educate public about AATD
- Pressure policymakers (legislators pay attention to media coverage)

**Types of Media**:

1. **Earned Media**: News coverage (TV, radio, newspapers, online news)
2. **Social Media**: Facebook, Instagram, X (Twitter), TikTok, LinkedIn
3. **Opinion Media**: Op-eds, letters to editor, blog posts

---

### Talking to Reporters

**If Reporter Contacts You**:

- Don't panic! (It's okay to ask for time to prepare—"Can I call you back in 30 minutes?")
- Call Foundation staff first (we can help you prepare, or join the interview)
- If time-sensitive, proceed (but follow tips below)

**Interview Tips**:

**Do**:

- ✅ Prepare key messages (3 key points you want to make)
- ✅ Tell your story (personal stories make good journalism)
- ✅ Bridge to your message (if reporter asks off-topic question → answer briefly → bridge back: "What's really important is...")
- ✅ Use plain language (assume audience knows nothing about AATD)
- ✅ Be quotable (short, punchy statements—"7-8 year diagnostic delay is unacceptable")

**Don't**:

- ❌ Say "no comment" (sounds guilty—instead: "I'm not familiar with that specific issue, but I can speak to...")
- ❌ Go off the record (assume everything is on the record—even casual conversation)
- ❌ Lie or speculate (if you don't know, say "I don't know, but I can find out")
- ❌ Attack (stay positive, solutions-focused)

---

### Writing Op-Eds

**Op-Ed** = Opinion Editorial (your opinion published in newspaper or online news site)

**Why Write Op-Eds**:

- Educate public about AATD
- Influence policymakers (they read local newspapers)
- Raise your profile (establish yourself as AATD advocate)

**Op-Ed Structure** (500-800 words):

**1. Hook** (First paragraph):

- Grab attention (statistic, personal story, provocative question)
- Example: "I spent 7 years seeing doctors before anyone tested me for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency. I'm not alone—700,000 Americans have AATD, and 90% are undiagnosed."

**2. Problem** (2-3 paragraphs):

- Explain the problem (diagnostic delay, coverage barriers, etc.)
- Use data + story (combine statistics with personal experience)

**3. Solution** (2-3 paragraphs):

- Propose solution (legislation, policy change, awareness campaign)
- Explain how it works + impact

**4. Call to Action** (Final paragraph):

- What should readers do? (contact legislators, get tested, learn more)
- Example: "I urge Florida legislators to support the AATD Early Detection Act. And I urge readers: if you have unexplained COPD or emphysema, ask your doctor about AATD testing. Early diagnosis saves lives."

**Where to Submit**:

- Local newspapers (start small—easier to get published)
- State newspapers (larger reach)
- National outlets (New York Times, Washington Post—harder, but worth trying)
- Online news sites (HuffPost, Medium, health blogs)

**Foundation Support**: Staff can help draft, edit, or co-author op-eds

---

### Letters to the Editor

**Letter to Editor** = Short response to news article or op-ed (150-300 words)

**Why Write Letters**:

- Easier to get published than op-ed (shorter, less competitive)
- Respond to news coverage (correct misinformation, add patient perspective)
- Reinforce advocacy messages

**Structure**:

1. Reference article ("I read [article title] on [date]...")
2. Your perspective (1-2 paragraphs—personal story or opinion)
3. Call to action (1 sentence)

**Where to Submit**:

- Local/state newspapers (email to letters@newspaper.com or online form)

---

## Written Advocacy Tools

### One-Pagers

**What**: Single-page fact sheet (policy summary, AATD overview, etc.)

**Purpose**: Leave-behind for legislator meetings, distribute at events

**Template**:

- **Title**: Bold, clear (e.g., "AATD Early Detection Act: Summary")
- **Problem**: 2-3 bullet points (why is this needed?)
- **Solution**: 2-3 bullet points (what does the bill/policy do?)
- **Impact**: Statistics (how many people affected? cost? outcomes?)
- **Call to Action**: What you're asking for (co-sponsor, vote yes, etc.)
- **Contact**: Foundation contact info

**Foundation Provides**: One-pagers for key policies (AATD 101, legislation summaries, etc.)

```
[Date]

The Honorable [Legislator Name]
[Address]
[City, State ZIP]

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name]:

I am writing to urge you to co-sponsor the Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) Early Detection Act, [Bill Number].

## Coalition Building

### Why Coalitions Matter

**Strength in Numbers**:

- More voices = more influence
- Diverse perspectives = broader support
- Shared resources = amplified impact

**Types of Coalitions**:

- **Disease-Specific**: AATD organizations (Alpha-1 Foundation, support groups)
- **Issue-Based**: Rare disease coalitions, lung health coalitions, genetic privacy coalitions
- **Geographic**: State rare disease councils, local patient groups

---

### Building Coalitions

**Steps**:

**1. Identify Potential Partners**:

- Who shares your goals? (other AATD groups, rare disease groups, lung/liver disease groups)
- Who has influence? (medical societies, patient organizations, unions)

**2. Reach Out**:

- Email or call potential partners
- Explain: What you're working on, why you want to partner, what you're asking

**3. Find Common Ground**:

- What do you agree on? (shared goals)
- What do you disagree on? (acknowledge differences, focus on common ground)

**4. Formalize Partnership**:

- Coalition charter (mission, goals, decision-making process)
- Regular meetings (monthly calls, quarterly in-person)
- Shared resources (materials, mailing lists, advocacy tools)

**5. Coordinate Advocacy**:

- Joint statements (press releases, sign-on letters)
- Shared events (Advocacy Day, awareness campaigns)
- Division of labor (who contacts which legislators, who writes op-ed, etc.)

---

## Advocacy Campaign Planning

### Campaign Planning Framework

**1. Goal**:

- What do you want to achieve? (pass legislation, change regulation, raise awareness)
- Specific, measurable, time-bound (e.g., "Pass AATD Early Detection Act by end of 2028")

**2. Target**:

- Who has the power to achieve your goal? (legislators, agency officials, corporate executives)
- Primary target (who makes the decision?)
- Secondary targets (who influences the decision-maker?)

**3. Message**:

- What do you want to communicate? (problem, solution, call to action)
- Tailored to audience (different messages for legislators, media, public)

**4. Tactics**:

- How will you reach your target? (meetings, media, social media, events, petitions)
- Mix of tactics (don't rely on one—use multiple approaches)

**5. Timeline**:

- When will you do what? (monthly action plan)
- Key milestones (bill introduction, committee hearing, floor vote)

**6. Resources**:

- What do you need? (people, money, materials)
- What do you have? (staff, volunteers, budget)
- What's the gap? (what do you need to acquire?)

**7. Evaluation**:

- How will you measure success? (# meetings, media mentions, petition signatures, bill progress)
- Adjust as needed (if tactics not working, try new approaches)

---
