## Why Stories Matter

### The Power of Stories

**Data tells, stories sell.**

- ✅ **Emotional Connection**: Stories create empathy and move people to action
- ✅ **Memorability**: People remember stories far better than statistics
- ✅ **Humanization**: Stories put faces and names to abstract problems
- ✅ **Persuasion**: Stories convince donors, policymakers, and media to support our cause
- ✅ **Inspiration**: Stories give hope to newly diagnosed patients

**Statistics set the stage. Stories close the deal.**

---

### Our Storytelling Mission

**"We tell authentic AATD patient stories to educate, inspire action, and demonstrate the urgent need to eliminate diagnostic delays."**

**Stories serve multiple purposes**:

- Fundraising appeals (move donors to give)
- Advocacy campaigns (move legislators to act)
- Patient education (show others they're not alone)
- Medical education (show physicians real consequences of delays)
- Media relations (give journalists human-interest angle)

---

## Storytelling Framework

### The Diagnostic Journey Arc

**Every AATD story follows a similar arc**:

```
1. Life Before → 2. First Symptoms → 3. Medical Run-Around → 4. Diagnosis → 5. Treatment & Advocacy → 6. Life Now
```

---

### Story Arc Breakdown

**1. Life Before Symptoms**

- Who was the person before AATD?
- What did they love to do? (work, hobbies, family)
- Set the stage: "This could be anyone."

**2. First Symptoms**

- When did they first notice something was wrong?
- What symptoms? (shortness of breath, coughing, fatigue)
- How did it impact daily life?

**3. The Medical Run-Around** (the crisis)

- How many doctors did they see?
- What were they told? (misdiagnoses: asthma, COPD, anxiety)
- How long did this go on?
- Emotional toll: frustration, fear, confusion
- **This is the diagnostic delay we're fighting.**

**4. The Diagnosis** (the turning point)

- How did they finally get diagnosed?
- Who ordered the right test?
- What was the reaction? (relief, fear, anger, confusion)

**5. Treatment & Advocacy**

- What treatment did they start? (augmentation therapy, lifestyle changes)
- How has it helped?
- How are they now advocating? (support groups, speaking out, policy work)

**6. Life Now**

- How is life different post-diagnosis?
- What's their message to others?
- What gives them hope?

---

### Story Elements That Work

**Specific Details**: Don't say "She felt bad." Say "She couldn't walk from her car to the grocery store without stopping to catch her breath."

**Dialogue**: Include direct quotes. "The doctor said, 'It's just anxiety. You need to relax.'"

**Emotion**: Show the frustration, fear, relief, hope.

**Relatable Moments**: "She missed her daughter's soccer games because she was too exhausted."

**Hope & Action**: End with what they're doing now and why they have hope.

---

## Ethics & Consent

### Patient Privacy & HIPAA

**Protected Health Information (PHI)** includes:

- Name, address, phone number
- Medical record numbers
- Photos of face
- Any other identifying information

**If patient voluntarily shares their story**: They're waiving their right to privacy **for that specific story only**. Still get written consent.

---

### Informed Consent Requirements

**Patient Storytelling Consent Form** must include:

1. **Purpose**: How story will be used (fundraising, website, advocacy, media)
2. **Content**: What information will be shared (name, photo, diagnosis, story details)
3. **Rights**: Patient can withdraw consent at any time (but published materials may remain)
4. **Compensation**: None (voluntary)
5. **Questions**: Contact person for concerns

**Signature**: Patient signs and dates

**Sample Consent Language**:
_"I, [Name], give Mark Egly Foundation permission to share my AATD story, including my name, photo, and medical information related to AATD, in print materials, online, in media interviews, and in fundraising/advocacy campaigns. I understand I can withdraw consent at any time by contacting [name] at [email], though materials already published may remain in circulation. I have received no compensation for sharing my story."_

---

### Ethical Storytelling Guidelines

**Do**:

- ✅ Get written consent for every use (fundraising, website, social media, etc.)
- ✅ Let patients review and approve before publishing
- ✅ Be transparent about how story will be used
- ✅ Respect patients' boundaries (if they don't want photo used, honor that)
- ✅ Protect minors (parental consent required for anyone under 18)
- ✅ Compensate for time if appropriate (e.g., gift card for 2-hour interview)

**Don't**:

- ❌ Share story without consent
- ❌ Embellish or change facts
- ❌ Use story in ways not disclosed to patient
- ❌ Pressure patients to share more than they're comfortable with
- ❌ Exploit suffering without showing hope or action

---

### Special Considerations

**Minors**: Parent/guardian must sign consent

**Deceased Patients**: Family member must sign consent (next of kin)

**Sensitive Topics**: If story involves suicide, abuse, or other sensitive topics, consult legal counsel on consent language

**Photos of Patients**: Separate photo release form (some patients may consent to written story but not photo)

---

## Story Formats

### 1. Written Testimonial (500-1,000 words)

**Structure**:

- Headline (compelling, specific): "After 8 Years and 5 Doctors, Sarah Finally Got Answers"
- Opening hook (emotional moment or shocking detail)
- Background (life before symptoms)
- Diagnostic journey (the struggle)
- Diagnosis and treatment (the turning point)
- Life now and advocacy (the hope)
- Closing quote (powerful, inspiring)

**Tone**: Conversational, emotional, hopeful

**POV**: First-person ("I") or third-person narrative ("Sarah says...")

**Example Opening**:
_"By the time Sarah Martinez was finally diagnosed with AATD, she had been to five different doctors, tried a dozen medications that didn't work, and missed countless family moments because she was too exhausted to participate. 'I felt like I was going crazy,' Sarah says. 'Every doctor told me it was just asthma or stress, but I knew something was seriously wrong.'"_

---

### 2. Video Story (2-5 minutes)

**Format**:

- Patient interviewed in comfortable setting (home, outdoors, support group)
- Mix of interview clips and B-roll (patient doing activities, family photos)
- Captions throughout (accessibility)
- Light background music (hopeful, not overdramatic)
- Opening text: "Patient Name | Diagnosed [Year] | [Location]"
- Closing text: Foundation logo + tagline + website

**B-Roll Ideas**:

- Patient breathing into spirometer or taking medication
- Family photos (before/after diagnosis)
- Patient at work, with family, doing hobbies
- Support group meetings
- Advocacy events

**Interviews**:

- Natural lighting (near window or outdoors)
- Frame patient off-center (rule of thirds)
- Comfortable chair or couch
- Simple background (not cluttered)

---

### 3. Social Media Story (150-300 words + photo)

**Short version of written testimonial**:

- Hook (1-2 sentences)
- Key details (diagnostic delay, misdiagnoses)
- Emotional impact (1-2 sentences)
- Hope/action (what they're doing now)
- Call-to-action (donate, get tested, share)

**Hashtags**: #AATD #Alpha1 #RareDisease #DiagnosticDelay #MarkEglyFoundation

**Example Instagram Post**:
_"Meet Sarah. For 8 years, doctors told her she had asthma. But her inhaler didn't work. Her breathing kept getting worse. Finally, a pulmonologist ordered the right test: AATD._

_Sarah's story is why we exist. Diagnostic delays aren't just frustrating—they're dangerous. Every year of delay means more irreversible lung damage._

_Today, Sarah is on augmentation therapy and leading her local AATD support group. She's sharing her story so others don't have to wait 8 years for answers._

_If you have unexplained breathing problems, get tested. Link in bio._

## Mark's Story

### The Founder's Journey (Template for All Tellings)

**Headline**: _"From Misdiagnosis to Mission: How Mark Egly Turned Personal Frustration into a Foundation"_

---

### Mark's Story (Full Version - 1,000 words)

**Life Before AATD**

Mark Egly didn't set out to become a rare disease advocate. He was a PGA golf professional, working at country clubs and teaching the sport he loved. Golf was more than a job—it was his life. He spent hours on the course, walking 18 holes multiple times a week, teaching lessons, and playing in tournaments.

But in his mid-30s, something changed. He started feeling short of breath during rounds. At first, he chalked it up to being out of shape. But even after improving his fitness, the breathlessness persisted. Then came the chronic cough. The fatigue. The chest tightness.

"I knew something was wrong," Mark recalls. "But I didn't know what."

---

**The Medical Run-Around**

Mark did what anyone would do: He went to the doctor. Then another. And another.

Over seven years, Mark saw multiple physicians. Each one had a different theory: asthma, allergies, bronchitis, acid reflux. He tried inhaler after inhaler. Antibiotics. Allergy medications. Nothing worked.

"Every doctor was treating symptoms, not looking for a root cause," Mark says. "I'd leave appointments feeling dismissed, like they thought I was exaggerating."

The worst part wasn't the physical symptoms—it was the uncertainty. Mark's career depended on being able to walk a golf course. His quality of life depended on breathing freely. And no one could tell him why he couldn't.

As the years went by, his lung function declined. He had to cut back on teaching. Some days, he couldn't make it through 18 holes without stopping to catch his breath. He watched his colleagues and friends play effortlessly while he struggled.

"I felt like my body was betraying me, and no one could explain why."

---

**The Self-Diagnosis**

By year seven, Mark was frustrated enough to take matters into his own hands. He started researching his symptoms online—shortness of breath, early-onset emphysema, chronic lung disease.

That's when he came across Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD).

The description matched perfectly: genetic lung disease, often misdiagnosed as asthma or COPD, affects people in their 30s-50s. A simple blood test can diagnose it.

"I read about AATD and thought, 'This is me. This is what I have,'" Mark says. "But why hadn't any of my doctors tested for it?"

He brought his research to his doctor and asked for an AAT blood test. The doctor was skeptical but agreed.

Two weeks later, the results confirmed it: Mark had Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, severe type (ZZ genotype). The diagnosis that should have taken one blood test had taken seven years.

---

**The Turning Point**

Mark's emotions were mixed. Relief—finally, an answer. Anger—this could have been diagnosed years ago. Fear—what damage had already been done?

He started augmentation therapy (weekly infusions of AAT protein) to slow the progression of his lung disease. He changed his lifestyle, avoiding lung irritants and optimizing his health. Slowly, he regained some quality of life.

But the question haunted him: **Why did it take seven years?**

The more Mark learned about AATD, the more alarmed he became. His experience wasn't unique—it was typical. The average AATD patient waits 7-8 years and sees 4+ doctors before diagnosis. An estimated 300,000 Americans have AATD but don't know it. Diagnostic delays lead to irreversible lung damage that could have been prevented.

"I thought, 'This is insane. We know what AATD is. We know how to test for it. We know how to treat it. So why are people waiting years for answers?'"

---

**From Frustration to Innovation**

Mark isn't someone who accepts broken systems. As a businessman and golfer, he's used to problem-solving, strategizing, and innovating. He started thinking: What if we could diagnose AATD faster? What if we could repurpose the AAT protein for other conditions?

That curiosity led Mark to research and eventually secure a patent (US20220160847) for repurposing AAT protein to help firefighters, military personnel, and asthma patients—groups at higher risk of lung damage.

But the patent was just the beginning. Mark realized that fixing the AATD diagnostic delay crisis required a comprehensive approach: educating doctors, supporting patients, funding research, and changing policy.

So in 2025, he founded **Mark Egly Foundation** with a bold mission: **Eliminate AATD diagnostic delays.**

---

**The Mission Today**

Mark Egly Foundation isn't like other rare disease organizations. It's laser-focused on one problem: diagnostic delays. The foundation works on four fronts:

1. **Medical Education**: Training physicians to recognize AATD early through free CME courses
2. **Patient Support**: Helping patients navigate testing, treatment, and the healthcare system
3. **Research Innovation**: Funding quick-test devices, mass AAT production, and novel therapies
4. **Policy Advocacy**: Pushing for newborn screening and workplace protections

The goal is ambitious but measurable: **Cut diagnostic delays in half—from 7-8 years to 3-4 years—by 2030.**

"If I can save even one person from going through what I went through, this foundation will have been worth it," Mark says. "But I think we can help thousands."

---

**Mark's Message**

Today, Mark is stable on augmentation therapy. He's back on the golf course, though not at the pace he once was. But his focus has shifted from par scores to policy wins, from teaching golf to teaching doctors about AATD.

His message to AATD patients: **"You're not alone. There's hope. And there's treatment—if you can get diagnosed."**

His message to doctors: **"Think AATD. Test early. One blood test can change—or save—a life."**

His message to supporters: **"We can fix this. Diagnostic delays are preventable. With your help, we'll make sure no one else waits seven years for answers."**

### Mark's Story (Short Version - 300 words)

Mark Egly is a PGA golf professional who spent seven years searching for answers. He experienced shortness of breath, chronic cough, and declining lung function—but doctor after doctor told him it was asthma, allergies, or stress. Nothing they prescribed worked.

By year seven, Mark was frustrated enough to research his symptoms himself. He discovered Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD), a genetic lung disease that matched his symptoms perfectly. He asked his doctor for a simple blood test. The result: severe AATD (ZZ genotype).

Mark's diagnosis should have taken one blood test. Instead, it took seven years and multiple misdiagnoses. By the time he was diagnosed, he had irreversible lung damage.

But Mark didn't just move on. He learned that his experience was typical—the average AATD patient waits 7-8 years for diagnosis, and an estimated 300,000 Americans have AATD but don't know it. He also discovered that diagnostic delays are preventable with physician education and policy changes.

So Mark founded **Mark Egly Foundation** to eliminate diagnostic delays through medical education, patient support, research innovation, and policy advocacy. He even secured a patent (US20220160847) for repurposing AAT protein to help firefighters, military personnel, and asthma patients.

Today, Mark is on augmentation therapy and stable. His mission: **Cut AATD diagnostic delays in half by 2030**—from 7-8 years to 3-4 years. He's training physicians, supporting patients, and pushing for newborn screening legislation.

"If I can save even one person from going through what I went through," Mark says, "this foundation will have been worth it."

### Example Case Study

**Title**: _From 8-Year Delay to 3-Month Diagnosis: How Patient Navigation Changed Sarah's Life_

---

**Background**
Sarah Martinez, a 42-year-old elementary school teacher from Phoenix, experienced shortness of breath and chronic cough for eight years before being diagnosed with AATD. By the time she found Mark Egly Foundation, she had seen six doctors, tried twelve medications, and lost hope of ever getting answers.

---

**The Challenge**
Sarah's symptoms began at age 34. Over the next eight years, she was misdiagnosed with asthma, anxiety, and COPD. No treatment worked. Her lung function declined. She missed work frequently and couldn't keep up with her students or her own children.

"I felt like I was drowning," Sarah says. "And no one could tell me why."

By age 42, Sarah had nearly given up. Then a friend shared a social media post about AATD. Sarah reached out to Mark Egly Foundation's patient navigation program.

---

**The Intervention**
Sarah was paired with a patient navigator, who:

1. Reviewed Sarah's medical history and symptoms
2. Connected Sarah with a pulmonologist experienced in AATD
3. Helped Sarah obtain an AAT blood test (covered by insurance)
4. Coordinated follow-up genetic testing to confirm diagnosis
5. Assisted with insurance approval for augmentation therapy

Total time from first contact to diagnosis: **3 months**.

---

**The Outcome**
Sarah was diagnosed with severe AATD (ZZ genotype) and started augmentation therapy. Within six months, her quality of life improved significantly.

"For the first time in eight years, I can breathe," Sarah says. "I'm back to teaching full-time. I can play with my kids. I have my life back."

Sarah also joined a support group and now volunteers as a patient storyteller and advocate.

---

**The Impact**
Sarah's case demonstrates the power of patient navigation:

- **Speed**: 3 months vs. 8 years (97% faster)
- **Accuracy**: Direct path to correct diagnosis (no more misdiagnoses)
- **Access**: Navigator helped overcome insurance and referral barriers
- **Support**: Sarah wasn't alone in navigating the system

Mark Egly Foundation is scaling this model to serve 500 patients per year by Year 5.

---

**Key Takeaways**

- ✅ Patient navigation dramatically reduces diagnostic delays
- ✅ Connecting patients with AATD-experienced physicians is critical
- ✅ Insurance navigation removes financial barriers
- ✅ Early diagnosis enables treatment and improves quality of life
- ✅ Patients who receive support often become advocates themselves
