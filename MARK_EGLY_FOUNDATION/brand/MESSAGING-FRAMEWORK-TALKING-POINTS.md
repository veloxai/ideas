## Elevator Pitches

### 30-Second Pitch (Networking, Casual Conversations)

_"I work with the Mark Egly Foundation. We're a nonprofit working to eliminate diagnostic delays for AATD—a genetic lung disease that affects 300,000 Americans but takes an average of 7-8 years to diagnose. Every year of delay means more lung damage, so we're training doctors, supporting patients, and pushing for policy changes to cut those delays in half by 2030. It's named after Mark Egly, a PGA golfer who went through the diagnostic nightmare himself and decided to fix the system."_

---

### 60-Second Pitch (Donor Meetings, Introductions)

_"The Mark Egly Foundation eliminates diagnostic delays for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, or AATD—a genetic condition that causes lung and liver disease. Here's the crisis: An estimated 300,000 Americans have AATD but don't know it, and those who do know waited an average of 7-8 years to get diagnosed. By the time they're diagnosed, many have irreversible lung damage._

_We're solving this through four strategies: First, educating physicians with free CME courses so they recognize AATD earlier. Second, supporting patients with navigation services and financial assistance. Third, funding research like quick-test devices and new treatments. And fourth, advocating for policies like newborn screening._

_Our founder, Mark Egly, is a PGA golfer who experienced this diagnostic delay firsthand and even holds a patent for repurposing the AATD protein for firefighters and military. Our goal is ambitious but achievable: Cut diagnostic delays in half by 2030. That means thousands of people will get diagnosed before it's too late."_

---

### 2-Minute Pitch (Formal Presentations, Major Donor Cultivation)

_"Imagine experiencing shortness of breath, chronic coughing, and constant fatigue—but every doctor you see tells you it's just asthma or bronchitis. You try inhaler after inhaler, but nothing works. Seven years go by. Four different doctors. Finally, one orders the right blood test, and you learn you have Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency—a genetic condition that's been destroying your lungs this entire time. Now the damage is irreversible._

_This is the reality for 100,000 diagnosed AATD patients in the U.S. And it's the reality that an estimated 300,000 more will face if we don't change the system. That's why the Mark Egly Foundation exists._

_We were founded by Mark Egly, a PGA golf professional who lived this nightmare himself. After years of being misdiagnosed, Mark finally figured it out on his own. But instead of just moving on, he decided to fix the broken system. He's even patented an innovation for repurposing the AAT protein to help firefighters, military personnel, and asthma patients._

_Our strategy is comprehensive: We're training physicians through free, accredited CME courses so they recognize AATD early. We're supporting patients with navigation services, financial assistance, and community—because diagnosis is just the first step. We're funding research into innovations like quick-circulating AAT test devices and mass protein production. And we're advocating for policy changes like newborn screening and workplace protections for high-risk groups._

_But here's what sets us apart: We don't just measure awareness. We measure impact. Our north star metric is Diagnostic Delay Time—the time from first symptoms to diagnosis. And we've set a bold, measurable goal: Cut that 7-8 year average in half by 2030._

_By Year 5, we'll have trained 2,000 physicians, served 10,000 patients, and helped pass newborn screening laws in 5 states. That's not just awareness—that's lives saved and suffering prevented._

_And we're transparent about it. Every quarter, we report on our progress publicly. Donors and supporters can see exactly how their contributions move the needle._

_This is personal for us. It's urgent. And it's solvable. With your support, we're going to eliminate AATD diagnostic delays and ensure that no one else has to wait 7 years for answers. Thank you."_

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### General AATD Questions

**Q: What is AATD?**
A: Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) is a genetic condition that causes low levels of the AAT protein, which protects the lungs and liver. Low AAT leads to lung disease (emphysema) and liver disease. It's inherited from both parents and affects an estimated 300,000+ Americans.

**Q: What are the symptoms of AATD?**
A: Common symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, chronic cough, frequent respiratory infections, and fatigue. Symptoms often mimic asthma or COPD, which is why AATD is frequently misdiagnosed. Some people also develop liver disease (cirrhosis).

**Q: How is AATD diagnosed?**
A: A simple blood test measures AAT protein levels and identifies genetic mutations. If levels are low, genetic testing confirms the specific SERPINA1 gene mutations (e.g., ZZ, SZ, MZ).

**Q: Is there a cure for AATD?**
A: There's no cure, but augmentation therapy (weekly infusions of AAT protein) can slow lung disease progression. Liver transplant is the only cure for severe liver disease. Early detection and lifestyle changes (avoiding smoking, reducing lung irritants) also help.

**Q: Who should get tested for AATD?**
A: The WHO recommends testing everyone with COPD. You should also get tested if you have unexplained lung disease, family history of AATD, chronic liver disease, or certain occupational exposures (firefighters, military).

### What NOT to Say in a Crisis

❌ "No comment." (Sounds evasive)
❌ "It's not a big deal." (Minimizes concern)
❌ "That's not true." (Without evidence to back it up)
❌ "We can't talk about it." (Without explanation)
❌ "It's not our fault." (Defensive)

**Instead**: Be honest, empathetic, and solution-focused.

- ✅ Stick to your expertise (AATD and foundation programs)
- ✅ Use plain language (avoid jargon)
- ✅ Tell patient stories (with permission)
- ✅ Cite credible sources (WHO, research studies)
- ✅ Bridge back to key messages ("What's important to understand is...")
- ✅ Be authentic and passionate

**Don't**:

- ❌ Speculate or guess
- ❌ Say "no comment" (offer to follow up instead)
- ❌ Go off the record (assume everything is on the record)
- ❌ Badmouth other organizations
- ❌ Make promises you can't keep

---

### Media Interview Template

**Reporter**: _Tell me about Mark Egly Foundation._

**You**: _Mark Egly Foundation eliminates diagnostic delays for AATD, a genetic lung disease that affects 300,000 Americans but takes 7-8 years to diagnose. We train doctors, support patients, fund research, and advocate for policy changes. Our goal is to cut diagnostic delays in half by 2030._

---

**Reporter**: _What's the impact of diagnostic delays?_

**You**: _Every year of delay means progression of irreversible lung disease. By the time many AATD patients are diagnosed, they've already lost significant lung function. Early detection allows for treatment—augmentation therapy—that can slow progression and improve quality of life. That's why our work is so urgent._

---

**Reporter**: _Why does it take so long to diagnose AATD?_

**You**: _AATD symptoms mimic common conditions like asthma and COPD, so doctors often don't think to test for it. Medical schools spend little time on rare diseases, so many physicians aren't familiar with AATD. The World Health Organization recommends testing all COPD patients for AATD, but only 10% of U.S. doctors actually do. We're changing that through education and advocacy._

---

**Reporter**: _Tell me about Mark Egly._

**You**: _Mark is a PGA golf professional who went through the diagnostic delay crisis himself—7 years of seeing doctors who missed his AATD. He finally self-diagnosed and confirmed it with a blood test. But instead of just moving on, he founded this organization to fix the system. He even holds a patent for repurposing the AAT protein to help firefighters and military personnel. His story is our "why"—it's personal, urgent, and drives everything we do._

---

**Reporter**: _What can people do to help?_

**You**: _Three things: First, if you have unexplained breathing problems or family history of lung disease, get tested for AATD. Second, spread the word—many people have never heard of AATD. And third, support our work. Donate at MarkEglyFoundation.org or volunteer. Every contribution helps us reach more doctors, help more patients, and ultimately save lives._
