## Program Overview

### The Problem

**Physicians are missing AATD diagnoses because they're not trained to recognize it.**

**Key Statistics**:

- Only 10% of U.S. physicians routinely test COPD patients for AATD (despite WHO recommendations)
- Medical schools spend minimal time on rare diseases
- Average physician graduates without exposure to AATD cases
- Diagnostic delays average 7-8 years because symptoms mimic common conditions

**The Impact**:

- Patients are misdiagnosed with asthma, COPD, or bronchitis for years
- Irreversible lung damage occurs before correct diagnosis
- Treatment opportunities are missed
- Patients suffer unnecessarily

---

### The Solution

**Free, accredited CME courses that train physicians to:**

- ✅ Recognize AATD symptoms and risk factors
- ✅ Know when to test (WHO guidelines)
- ✅ Order correct diagnostic tests
- ✅ Interpret results and refer appropriately
- ✅ Understand treatment options (augmentation therapy)
- ✅ Provide genetic counseling for families

**Result**: More physicians test for AATD → Earlier diagnoses → Better outcomes

---

### Program Goals

**Year 1**:

- Launch 1 foundational CME course (1.0 CME credits)
- Train 500 physicians
- Achieve 90%+ satisfaction rating
- Document 50+ AATD diagnoses resulting from course

**Year 3**:

- Expand to 3 courses (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Train 1,500 physicians annually
- Partner with 10 medical institutions
- Track 200+ annual diagnoses attributed to training

**Year 5**:

- Train 2,000 physicians annually (cumulative: 7,500+ trained)
- Offer courses in-person, online, and at conferences
- Achieve national recognition as premier AATD education provider
- Measurable impact: Reduce diagnostic delays in trained physicians' patients by 50%

---

## CME Accreditation Strategy

### What is CME?

**Continuing Medical Education (CME)** is required for physicians to maintain licensure. Physicians must complete a certain number of CME credits annually.

**Why CME matters for us**:

- ✅ Physicians actively seek CME courses
- ✅ Accreditation signals quality and credibility
- ✅ Free CME is highly attractive (removes cost barrier)
- ✅ Tracking CME completion = data on reach and impact

---

### Accreditation Process

**Option 1: Direct Accreditation (ACCME)**

- **Accrediting Body**: Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME)
- **Process**: Apply to become accredited CME provider
- **Timeline**: 12-18 months for initial accreditation
- **Cost**: $10,000-$15,000 application fee + annual fees
- **Pros**: Full control, foundation branded, long-term investment
- **Cons**: Time-consuming, expensive, requires dedicated staff

**Option 2: Joint Providership (Partner with Accredited Institution)**

- **Process**: Partner with medical school, hospital, or CME accreditation company
- **Timeline**: 3-6 months to develop and launch course
- **Cost**: $5,000-$10,000 per course for joint providership
- **Pros**: Faster, less expensive, leverage partner's credibility
- **Cons**: Less control, partner name appears alongside foundation

**Recommendation for Year 1**: **Joint Providership**

- Faster time to market
- Lower upfront costs
- Test course demand before investing in direct accreditation
- Transition to direct accreditation in Year 2-3 once program is established

---

### Joint Providership Partners (Options)

**Medical Schools**:

- University of Arizona College of Medicine (Phoenix)
- Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine

- Pulmonologists are primary AATD diagnosticians
- Large membership (19,000+ physicians)
- Established CME program
- Annual conference with 6,000+ attendees

---

### Accreditation Requirements

**To qualify for CME accreditation, course must**:

- ✅ Address identified educational need (diagnostic delays = clear need)
- ✅ Include measurable learning objectives
- ✅ Be evidence-based (cite research, guidelines)
- ✅ Be free from commercial bias (no pharmaceutical promotion)
- ✅ Include pre-test and post-test to assess learning
- ✅ Provide certificate of completion
- ✅ Collect evaluation data

**CME Credit Calculation**:

- 1 CME credit = 1 hour of instruction
- Example: 60-minute course = 1.0 CME credits

---

---

### Impact Tracking (Long-Term)

**Question**: _Does CME course lead to more AATD diagnoses?_

**How to Track**:

**Method 1: Post-Course Survey (3-6 months after completion)**

- Email survey to course completers
- Questions:
  - Have you tested any patients for AATD since taking this course? (Yes/No)
  - If yes, how many? (Number)
  - How many were diagnosed with AATD? (Number)
  - Would you have tested these patients before taking the course? (Yes/No/Unsure)

**Method 2: Physician Self-Reporting**

- Optional: Physicians can submit case reports
- Form: "I diagnosed an AATD patient as a result of your CME course"
- Collect anonymized data (no PHI)

**Method 3: Partner with Labs**

- Partner with AATD testing labs (e.g., AlphaID, Grifols)
- Track: Are more tests being ordered by course-completing physicians?
- Compare: Test volume by trained vs. untrained physicians

**Method 4: National Data Analysis**

- Long-term: Analyze national AATD diagnosis trends
- Hypothesis: Regions with higher CME enrollment → shorter diagnostic delays

**Year 1 Impact Goal**: Document 50+ AATD diagnoses attributed to CME course

---

---

## Summary: CME as a Force Multiplier

**Why CME Works**:

- ✅ Physicians need CME → Built-in demand
- ✅ Free CME removes cost barrier
- ✅ Online delivery = scalable (500 → 2,000+ physicians)
- ✅ Credible, evidence-based education
- ✅ Direct impact: Trained physicians diagnose AATD earlier

**The Multiplier Effect**:

- 1 trained physician diagnoses 10 AATD patients over career
- 500 trained physicians (Year 1) = 5,000 potential diagnoses
- 2,000 trained annually (Year 5) = 20,000 diagnoses over 10 years

**Our north star metric**: Reduce diagnostic delays
**CME is the vehicle**: Educate physicians → Earlier testing → Earlier diagnosis → Better outcomes

---

**Next Steps** (Year 1, Q1-Q2):

1. ✅ Hire Medical Education Director
2. ✅ Secure joint providership with CHEST
3. ✅ Develop foundational CME course
4. ✅ Submit for accreditation approval
5. ✅ Build LMS platform
6. ✅ Launch marketing campaign
7. ✅ Enroll first 500 physicians
