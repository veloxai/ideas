## Program Overview

### What is Patient Navigation?

**Patient Navigation** is personalized, one-on-one support helping AATD patients:

- ✅ **Understand diagnosis** (genetics, prognosis, treatment options)
- ✅ **Access testing** (AAT level testing, genetic testing, pulmonary function tests)
- ✅ **Find specialists** (pulmonologists, hepatologists, AATD experts)
- ✅ **Navigate insurance** (coverage, prior authorizations, appeals)
- ✅ **Coordinate care** (appointments, medical records, second opinions)
- ✅ **Connect to resources** (financial assistance, support groups, clinical trials)
- ✅ **Advocate for themselves** (prepare for appointments, ask right questions, self-advocacy skills)

**Navigator = "Sherpa"**: Guides patient through complex healthcare terrain (doesn't replace doctor, but helps patient get most from medical care)

---

### Program Goals

**Year 1** (2026):

- 2 full-time Patient Navigators hired
- 500 patients served (100 intensive cases, 400 brief consultations)
- 90% patient satisfaction
- Average 5 touchpoints per patient (calls, emails, meetings)

**Year 3** (2028):

- 5 Navigators
- 2,000 patients served/year
- Specialized navigators (pediatric, transplant, veterans)

**Year 5** (2030):

- 10 Navigators (covering all regions)
- 5,000 patients served/year (5% of US diagnosed AATD population)
- 24/7 crisis navigation line

---

## Why Navigation Matters

### The Healthcare Maze Problem

**AATD patients face extraordinary complexity**:

- **Rare disease** (most doctors have never seen AATD—misdiagnosis common)
- **Multi-system disease** (lungs + liver + skin—need multiple specialists)
- **Complex genetics** (ZZ, MZ, MS, rare variants—confusing even for doctors)
- **Expensive treatment** (augmentation therapy $100K-$200K/year—insurance battles)
- **Fragmented care** (PCP, pulmonologist, hepatologist, geneticist—no one coordinates)
- **Information overload** (Google search returns conflicting info—what to trust?)

**Without navigation, patients get lost**:

- Delayed treatment (6-12 months to get augmentation therapy approved—patients give up)
- Mismanaged care (lung doctor doesn't know about liver disease, vice versa)
- Financial catastrophe (don't know about assistance programs—go into debt)
- Treatment non-adherence (overwhelmed, confused, frustrated—stop infusions)

**With navigation, patients succeed**:

- Faster treatment access (Navigator handles prior auth paperwork—approved in 4-6 weeks vs. 6+ months)
- Coordinated care (Navigator ensures all doctors communicate)
- Financial stability (connected to assistance programs—$0 out-of-pocket for many patients)
- Better outcomes (less stress, better adherence, improved quality of life)

### Patient Stories

**Story 1: Jessica's Diagnosis Journey (Newly Diagnosed)**:

- 38-year-old female, ZZ AATD diagnosis (FEV1 58%)
- Pulmonologist said "You have AATD, here's a brochure, see you in 6 months"
- Jessica panicked ("Am I dying? What do I do? Who do I call?")
- **Navigator stepped in**:
  - Spent 1 hour on phone explaining AATD (genetics, prognosis, treatment options)
  - Scheduled genetic counseling (explain inheritance, test family members)
  - Connected to support group (met other young women with AATD)
  - Started augmentation therapy paperwork (insurance approval in 6 weeks)
- **Outcome**: "My Navigator saved me. I went from terrified to empowered. She answered every question, held my hand through the process. I couldn't have done this alone."

**Story 2: Tom's Insurance Battle (Treatment Access)**:

- 55-year-old male, needed augmentation therapy (FEV1 45%)
- Insurance denied (said "not medically necessary")
- Tom didn't know how to appeal (gave up, lung function declined)
- **Navigator intervened**:
  - Reviewed denial letter (identified issue—missing PFT documentation)
  - Gathered medical records (PFTs, AAT levels, doctor letters)
  - Wrote appeal letter (cited ATS guidelines, medical necessity)
  - Submitted appeal (approved 3 weeks later)
- **Outcome**: "My Navigator fought for me when I didn't have energy to fight. She knew exactly what insurance needed. Now I'm on therapy, feeling better every week."

**Story 3: Maria's Care Coordination (Complex Case)**:

- 8-year-old boy, ZZ AATD with liver disease
- Seeing 5 specialists (pulmonologist, hepatologist, geneticist, nutritionist, pediatrician)
- No one coordinating care (conflicting instructions, duplicate tests, confused parents)
- **Navigator became quarterback**:
  - Created shared care plan (all doctors on same page)
  - Scheduled appointments efficiently (minimize school absences)
  - Coordinated records sharing (eliminated duplicate tests)
  - Connected family to financial assistance (travel grants, lodging)
- **Outcome**: "Our Navigator brought order to chaos. Before her, we were drowning. Now we have a plan, a team, and hope."

- **Duration**: 1-4 weeks
- **Caseload**: 100-150 brief cases per Navigator per year

**Year 1**: 2 Navigators → 50 intensive + 200-300 brief = 500 patients total

---

## Services Provided

### 1. Diagnosis Support (First 90 Days)

**When Patient Contacts Foundation**:

- **Phone Call** (within 24 hours—Navigator calls newly diagnosed patient)
- **First Conversation** (60-90 min):
  - Understand patient's story (how diagnosed, symptoms, fears, questions)
  - Explain AATD basics (genetics, prognosis, treatment, NOT a death sentence)
  - Assess needs (insurance, specialist, family testing, financial concerns)
  - Create action plan (prioritize steps—genetic counseling first, or start augmentation therapy?)

**Navigator Actions**:

- ✅ Send Welcome Packet (What is AATD guide, testing info, Foundation services)
- ✅ Schedule genetic counseling (explain inheritance, recommend family testing)
- ✅ Find AATD specialist (locate expert pulmonologist within patient's insurance network)
- ✅ Connect to support group (virtual or local—peer support crucial in first months)
- ✅ Start insurance verification (check coverage for augmentation therapy, testing)

**Follow-Up**:

- Week 1: Check in (how are you doing? questions from packet?)
- Week 2: Genetic counseling debrief (what did you learn? family testing plans?)
- Week 4: Specialist appointment prep (prepare questions, what to expect)
- Week 6: After specialist visit (what did doctor say? next steps?)
- Week 12: Treatment status check (on augmentation? insurance approved? feeling better?)

---

### 2. Treatment Access Support

**Augmentation Therapy Navigation**:

- **Insurance Verification**: Navigator calls insurance (verify coverage, prior auth requirements)
- **Prior Authorization**: Gather documentation (PFTs, AAT levels, doctor letter), submit paperwork
- **Follow-Up**: Track status (call insurance weekly, push for faster decision)
- **Denial Management**: If denied, write appeal (cite ATS/ERS guidelines, medical necessity), resubmit
- **Approval**: Once approved, connect patient to infusion center, home health, or self-infusion training

**Timeline Goals**:

- Without Navigator: 3-6 months (average time to start therapy—many give up)
- With Navigator: 4-8 weeks (Navigator expedites process)

**Clinical Trial Navigation**:

- Identify relevant trials (match patient to appropriate studies—gene therapy, new AAT formulations)
- Explain trial (what's involved, risks/benefits, how to enroll)
- Facilitate enrollment (connect patient to research coordinator, help with travel logistics)

---

### 3. Specialist Referral & Coordination

**Finding the Right Doctor**:

- **Navigator uses database**: 200+ AATD specialists nationwide (Cleveland Clinic, National Jewish, Mayo, regional experts)
- **Filter by**: Insurance network, location, subspecialty (pediatric, liver, transplant)
- **Provide options**: Give patient 2-3 specialist names (bio, credentials, patient reviews)

**Appointment Coordination**:

- Call to schedule (Navigator can make appointment on patient's behalf—if requested)
- Prepare patient (send appointment prep checklist, questions to ask)
- Send records (ensure specialist has PFTs, AAT levels, genetic testing before visit)
- Follow-up (call after appointment—what did doctor say? understand recommendations?)

**Care Team Communication**:

- Facilitate sharing (connect pulmonologist + hepatologist + PCP—shared care plan)
- Avoid duplication (ensure one doctor orders PFTs, not all three—save patient time, money)

---

### 4. Insurance Navigation & Financial Assistance

**Insurance Education**:

- Explain coverage (deductibles, copays, out-of-pocket max—how much will patient pay?)
- Verify benefits (call insurance—confirm AAT testing, augmentation therapy, specialist visits covered)
- Prior authorization coaching (if patient wants to do it themselves, Navigator provides template, guides process)

**Appeals Support**:

- Review denial letter (identify reason—missing documentation? coverage exclusion? medical necessity dispute?)
- Gather evidence (PFTs, AAT levels, ATS guidelines, peer-reviewed studies)
- Write appeal (Navigator drafts letter, patient reviews/signs)
- Submit & track (follow up every 5-7 days, escalate if delayed)

**Financial Assistance Connection**:

- **Patient Assistance Programs** (pharma-sponsored—Grifols, CSL Behring, Takeda offer copay assistance, free drug for uninsured)
- **Foundation Grants** (testing assistance, travel grants, emergency funds)
- **Copay Cards** (reduce out-of-pocket to $0-$10 per infusion)
- **Medicare/Medicaid** (help patient apply if eligible—disability, low income)

**Goal**: Reduce financial barriers → 90% of patients access therapy at $0-$50/month out-of-pocket

---

### 5. Ongoing Support & Check-Ins

**Long-Term Relationship**:

- Navigator stays connected (not indefinitely, but until patient stable and resourced)
- **Quarterly Check-Ins** (after intensive phase): "How are you? Any issues? Questions?"
- **Open Door Policy**: Patient can always call back (even years later—Navigator remembers them)

**Life Transitions**:

- **Job Change**: New insurance → Navigator helps re-verify coverage, transfer to new specialist if needed
- **Pregnancy**: Connect to high-risk OB, genetic counselor (discuss AATD pregnancy management)
- **Transplant Listing**: Intensive navigation resumes (explain process, connect to transplant center, financial assistance for travel)
- **Disease Progression**: If lung/liver worsens → Navigator helps access hospice, palliative care (end-of-life support)

---

- ✅ Financial assistance (copay cards, patient assistance programs)

**Touchpoints**: 5-8 (bi-weekly during setup, then monthly)

---

### Stage 4: Stable Management (6+ Months Post-Diagnosis)

**Patient Need**: "I'm on therapy, stable, know the ropes. Just need occasional help."

**Navigator Support**:

- ✅ Quarterly check-ins (proactive—"How are you?")
- ✅ On-demand help (patient calls with specific issue—job change, insurance denial, new symptom)
- ✅ Resource updates (new trials, policy changes, Foundation events)

**Touchpoints**: 2-4/year (unless crisis, then ramp up)

---

### Stage 5: Advanced Disease / Transplant (Variable Timeline)

**Patient Need**: "My disease is progressing. Need transplant. How do I prepare?"

**Navigator Support** (Intensive Again):

- ✅ Transplant center referral (connect to top centers—Cleveland Clinic, Duke, UCSF)
- ✅ Listing process (explain MELD score, waitlist, what to expect)
- ✅ Financial assistance (travel grants, lodging during evaluation/surgery)
- ✅ Emotional support (transplant is terrifying—connect to post-transplant patients, therapist)
- ✅ Post-transplant navigation (immunosuppression, rejection monitoring, long-term follow-up)

**Touchpoints**: 10-20 (pre-transplant intensive, post-transplant follow-up for 1 year)

---

## Case Management Process

### Intake & Assessment

2. **Provider Referral**: Doctor refers patient (common after diagnosis)
3. **Support Group**: Member mentions need, leader connects to Navigator
4. **Outreach**: Foundation identifies newly diagnosed (through testing program), Navigator proactively reaches out

**Initial Assessment** (30-60 min phone call):

- **Demographics**: Name, age, location, insurance, employment
- **Medical History**: Diagnosis date, genotype (ZZ, MZ, etc.), symptoms, FEV1, AAT level, current treatment
- **Current Needs**: What brings you to Navigation? (new diagnosis? insurance issue? need specialist?)
- **Priorities**: What's most urgent? (start therapy? find doctor? financial help?)
- **Resources**: What have you tried? (support group? Alpha1Life.com? patient assistance programs?)
- **Barriers**: What's blocking you? (insurance denial? can't afford copays? overwhelmed?)

**Document in CRM**: All info entered (Salesforce or similar—track interactions, follow-ups, outcomes)

---

### Action Plan Development

**Navigator Creates Customized Plan**:

- **Goal**: What does patient want to achieve? (start therapy, find specialist, get financial help)
- **Steps**: Break into action items (1. Verify insurance, 2. Submit prior auth, 3. Appeal if denied, 4. Connect to copay assistance)
- **Timeline**: When will each step happen? (Week 1: verify insurance, Week 2: submit paperwork, Week 4: follow up)
- **Responsibilities**: Who does what? (Navigator submits paperwork, patient signs forms, doctor writes letter)

**Share with Patient**: Email action plan (written roadmap—patient knows what to expect)

---
