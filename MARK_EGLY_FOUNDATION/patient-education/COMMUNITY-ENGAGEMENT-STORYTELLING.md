## Overview

### What is Patient Storytelling?

**Patient storytelling** is the strategic collection, production, and sharing of authentic AATD patient narratives to:

- ✅ **Raise Awareness**: Humanize AATD (faces, names, families—not just medical statistics)
- ✅ **Reduce Isolation**: Show patients "You're not alone" (see others thriving despite diagnosis)
- ✅ **Educate**: Teach through experience (symptoms, diagnosis journey, treatment, coping strategies)
- ✅ **Inspire Action**: Motivate advocacy (legislators moved by stories, not data)
- ✅ **Build Community**: Create connections (patients recognize themselves in others' stories)
- ✅ **Attract Donors**: Move hearts, open wallets (donors give to people, not causes)

**Stories are the Foundation's currency** → more powerful than any statistic, brochure, or website

---

### Strategic Goals

**Year 1** (2026):

- 100 patient stories collected (written, video, audio)
- 50 stories published (Alpha1Life.com, social media, newsletters)
- 10 signature stories (professional video production—fundraising, awareness campaigns)
- 1M story impressions (views, shares, engagement across all platforms)

**Year 3** (2028):

- 500 stories in Story Bank
- 200 published stories
- 50 signature video stories
- 5M impressions/year

**Year 5** (2030):

- 1,000 stories (comprehensive library—every AATD experience represented)
- 500 published stories
- 100 signature videos
- 10M impressions/year

---

## Why Storytelling Matters

### The Science of Storytelling

**Research shows stories are more effective than facts**:

- **23x more memorable** than facts alone (brain remembers narratives, not statistics)
- **4x more persuasive** for advocacy (legislators vote based on constituent stories, not policy briefs)
- **2x more donations** (donors give more when shown individual story vs. aggregate data)
- **Empathy activation**: Stories trigger mirror neurons (reader/viewer feels patient's emotions)

### AATD Storytelling Imperative

**Why AATD needs stories especially**:

- **Unknown disease** (99% of Americans have never heard of AATD—stories make it real)
- **Misunderstood** ("Just another lung disease" → No, genetic, rare, complex)
- **Invisible illness** (many patients look healthy—stories reveal hidden struggles)
- **Diagnostic delay crisis** (7-8 years average—stories show consequences, motivate change)
- **Policy inaction** (no federal newborn screening—stories move legislators to act)

---

### Impact Examples

**Story 1: Jessica's Video Changed Her State Law**:

- Young mother, ZZ AATD, featured in 3-minute video (diagnosis story, kids' genetic risk, plea for newborn screening)
- Video shown to state legislature (Health Committee watched, cried, voted unanimously for screening bill)
- **Result**: Bill passed, signed into law—now all babies in state screened for AATD
- **Lesson**: One compelling story > 100 pages of research

**Story 2: Tom's Testimony Secured $1M Grant**:

- Veteran with AATD, testified at Foundation fundraiser (burn pit exposure, misdiagnosis, VA battles)
- Pharmaceutical CEO in audience (moved, approached Foundation after event)
- **Result**: Company donated $1M to veteran AATD research program
- **Lesson**: Stories inspire action (donors, partners, supporters)

**Story 3: Maria's Facebook Post Built Support Group**:

- Parent of pediatric AATD patient, shared story on Facebook (child's liver disease, fear, isolation)
- Post went viral in AATD community (100+ shares, 50 parents commented "Me too!")
- **Result**: 20 parents formed Pediatric AATD Support Group (now meets monthly)
- **Lesson**: Stories build community (patients find each other)

---

## Story Types & Purposes

### 1. Diagnosis Stories (30% of Story Bank)

**Purpose**: Educate about diagnostic delay, symptoms, misdiagnosis

**Structure**:

- **Before Diagnosis**: Years of symptoms (shortness of breath, misdiagnosed as asthma)
- **Turning Point**: How finally diagnosed (new doctor, self-advocacy, genetic testing)
- **After Diagnosis**: Relief (finally know what's wrong), fear (what now?), hope (there's treatment)

**Key Messages**:

- Early diagnosis matters (treatment works best when started early)
- Advocate for yourself (if doctor dismisses symptoms, seek second opinion)
- Testing is easy (simple blood test—don't delay)

**Examples**:

- "I Was Misdiagnosed for 10 Years—Doctors Said It Was Asthma"
- "I Diagnosed Myself—Then Saved My Family"
- "My Doctor Had Never Heard of AATD—I Had to Educate Her"

---

### 2. Living Well Stories (25% of Story Bank)

**Purpose**: Inspire hope, show AATD patients can thrive

**Structure**:

- **Challenges**: Disease limitations (oxygen use, fatigue, frequent exacerbations)
- **Adaptation**: How patient adjusted (pacing, accommodations, mindset shifts)
- **Thriving**: Full life despite AATD (career, family, hobbies, advocacy)

**Key Messages**:

- AATD is not a death sentence (many patients live long, fulfilling lives)
- Treatment works (augmentation therapy slows disease, improves quality of life)
- Community helps (support groups, Alpha1Life.com, Foundation resources)

**Examples**:

- "I Climbed a Mountain with AATD (and Oxygen)"
- "I Run a Business, Raise Three Kids, and Manage AATD—Here's How"
- "I'm 72, Have AATD, and I'm Living My Best Life"

---

### 3. Advocacy Stories (15% of Story Bank)

**Purpose**: Motivate policy change, recruit advocates

**Structure**:

- **The Problem**: Policy gap (no newborn screening, insurance denials, discrimination)
- **Taking Action**: How patient advocated (testified, organized, lobbied)
- **The Win**: Change achieved (bill passed, coverage approved, awareness raised)

**Key Messages**:

- You can make a difference (legislators listen to constituents)
- Collective action works (organize, amplify voices)
- Advocacy is for everyone (don't need experience—just passion)

**Examples**:

- "I Testified at My State Capitol—And We Passed Newborn Screening"
- "I Fought My Insurance for 2 Years—And Won"
- "How 100 AATD Patients Changed Federal Policy"

---

### 4. Caregiver & Family Stories (15% of Story Bank)

**Purpose**: Recognize caregivers, address family dynamics, genetic implications

**Structure**:

- **Caregiver Perspective**: Watching loved one struggle (helplessness, fear, burnout)
- **Family Impact**: Genetic testing, siblings at risk, family planning decisions
- **Coping & Hope**: How family adapted, found support, grew stronger

**Key Messages**:

- Caregivers matter (Foundation supports families, not just patients)
- Genetic testing saves lives (test siblings, children—early diagnosis prevents harm)
- Families are stronger together (support groups, family counseling, shared advocacy)

**Examples**:

- "My Husband Has AATD—Here's How I Support Him Without Burning Out"
- "I Tested My Kids for AATD—Best Decision I Ever Made"
- "Our Son's AATD Brought Our Family Closer"

---

### 5. Medical Professional Stories (10% of Story Bank)

**Purpose**: Educate providers, reduce diagnostic delay, recruit champions

**Structure**:

- **Missed Diagnosis**: Doctor shares case they missed (patient suffered, learned lesson)
- **Diagnostic Success**: Doctor shares how they caught AATD early (saved patient's life)
- **Professional Commitment**: Why doctor now screens all COPD patients, advocates for awareness

**Key Messages**:

- Test for AATD (in young COPD, non-smokers, family history)
- Diagnostic delay has consequences (legal, moral, patient outcomes)
- Doctors can be champions (educate colleagues, advocate for screening)

**Examples**:

- "I Missed AATD for 5 Years—Now I Test Everyone"
- "This Simple Test Saved My Patient's Life"
- "Why Every Pulmonologist Should Screen for AATD"

---

### 6. Loss & Memorial Stories (5% of Story Bank—Handle Sensitively)

**Purpose**: Honor those lost, motivate urgency for research and awareness

**Structure**:

- **Life Cut Short**: Patient died from AATD (late diagnosis, no treatment, complications)
- **Family Remembers**: Loved ones share story, mission to prevent others' suffering
- **Call to Action**: Donate, advocate, test—in memory of patient

**Key Messages**:

- AATD is serious (can be fatal if untreated)
- Early diagnosis saves lives (honor the lost by preventing future deaths)
- Donate to research (find better treatments, cure)

**Examples**:

- "In Memory of My Sister—Why I Fight for AATD Awareness"
- "He Was Diagnosed Too Late—Let's Make Sure No One Else Is"
- "A Mother's Mission: Newborn Screening After Losing My Son"

---

## Story Collection Process

### Step 1: Identify Storytellers

**Outreach Methods**:

- **Support Groups**: Ask leaders to nominate storytellers (patients who speak up in meetings—compelling, articulate)
- **Alpha1Life.com**: "Share Your Story" form (open submission—any patient can submit)
- **Navigator Referrals**: Patient Navigators identify great stories (during case management, ask "Would you share your story?")
- **Social Media**: Monitor Facebook, Instagram (patients already sharing—ask permission to feature)
- **Events**: Conferences, awareness walks (recruit storytellers at Foundation events)

**Ideal Storytellers**:

- ✅ Articulate (can explain AATD clearly, compelling speaker/writer)
- ✅ Authentic (vulnerable, honest—not polished or scripted)
- ✅ Diverse (represent all ages, races, genders, genotypes, disease stages—not just young, white, mildly affected)
- ✅ Willing (comfortable sharing publicly—name, photo, medical details)
- ✅ Available (responsive, meet deadlines, participate in promotion)

---

### Step 2: Pre-Interview & Consent

**Initial Contact**:

- Foundation staff calls patient (15-min conversation—explain storytelling program, what's involved)
- **Set Expectations**: "We'd love to share your story on Alpha1Life.com, social media, maybe newsletters. You'd do a 60-min interview, we'd draft story, you'd review and approve before publishing. Interested?"

**Consent Process**:

- Send **Storytelling Consent Form** (patient signs—gives permission to use name, photo, story)
- **Key Clauses**:
  - Right to review (patient approves final story before publishing)
  - Photo/video release (Foundation can use images in marketing, social media, fundraising)
  - Revocation (patient can withdraw story anytime—Foundation will remove)
  - No compensation (storytelling is volunteer—but Foundation may cover travel to events)

**HIPAA Considerations**:

- Patient **controls** what they share (no medical details without their explicit consent)
- Foundation does **not** access medical records (patient self-reports—they decide what's public)

---

### Step 3: Interview & Story Capture

**Interview Methods**:

- **Phone Interview** (60-90 min—most common, convenient for patient)
- **Video Call** (Zoom—if story will be video, capture interview footage)
- **In-Person** (conferences, support groups—deeper connection, body language)
- **Written Submission** (patient writes own story—less work for Foundation, but fewer patients willing)

**Interview Guide** (Questions to Ask):

1. **Diagnosis Journey**: "When were you diagnosed? What symptoms did you have? How long did it take?"
2. **Turning Point**: "What finally led to diagnosis? How did you feel when you got the news?"
3. **Treatment**: "Are you on augmentation therapy? How has it helped? Any challenges?"
4. **Daily Life**: "How does AATD affect your daily life? Work? Family? Hobbies?"
5. **Support**: "What resources have helped most? Support groups? Alpha1Life? Foundation?"
6. **Hope**: "What gives you hope? What would you say to newly diagnosed patients?"
7. **Advocacy**: "Are you involved in advocacy? Why is it important to you?"
8. **Call to Action**: "What do you want readers/viewers to take away from your story?"

**Recording**:

- Audio record (with permission—for transcription)
- Take notes (key quotes, emotional moments)
- Request photos (patient provides 3-5 photos—headshot, family, hobbies)

---

### Step 4: Story Production

**Written Stories** (800-1,200 words):

- **Draft**: Foundation writer/intern drafts story (based on interview, in patient's voice—first person)
- **Structure**:
  - **Hook** (1-2 paragraphs—grab attention, establish stakes)
  - **Diagnosis Journey** (3-4 paragraphs—symptoms, misdiagnosis, finally getting diagnosed)
  - **Treatment & Management** (2-3 paragraphs—augmentation therapy, lifestyle adjustments, coping)
  - **Life Today** (2-3 paragraphs—work, family, hobbies—patient thriving)
  - **Message of Hope** (1-2 paragraphs—advice for others, call to action)
- **Review**: Send draft to patient (patient edits, approves—usually 1-2 rounds of revisions)
- **Final Approval**: Patient signs off ("Yes, publish this")

**Video Stories** (3-5 minutes):

- **Script**: Based on written story (patient speaks to camera, tells story in their words)
- **Filming**: Professional videographer (if budget allows) or DIY (patient records on phone, Foundation edits)
- **Editing**: Add B-roll (patient at home, with family, doing activities), music, Foundation branding
- **Review**: Patient watches final video, approves before publishing

**Photo Stories** (Social Media):

- **Format**: Single photo + caption (100-200 words—patient's story in brief)
- **Quick & Shareable**: For Instagram, Facebook (drive traffic to full story on website)

---

## Storytelling Ethics & Consent

### Ethical Guidelines

**1. Informed Consent Always**:

- Patient signs consent form (before any story published)
- Explain exactly how story will be used (website? social media? fundraising materials?)
- Patient can revoke consent anytime (Foundation removes story promptly)

**2. Patient Controls Narrative**:

- Patient decides what to share (medical details, photos, family names)
- Foundation never pressures (if patient uncomfortable, respect boundaries)
- Patient approves final story (review, edit, approve before publishing)

**3. No Exploitation**:

- Don't sensationalize ("Dying from AATD" clickbait)
- Don't guilt-trip ("Donate or patients die")
- Respect dignity (especially end-of-life, pediatric stories—handle with care)

**4. Diverse Representation**:

- Seek stories from all demographics (not just young, white, affluent patients)
- Represent all disease stages (mild, severe, transplant, carriers—not just "inspiring" stories)
- Avoid tokenism (don't feature one minority patient to check box)

**5. Privacy Protection**:

- Use only patient-provided info (no medical records, no third-party info)
- Protect minors (parental consent for children, limit identifying details)
- Anonymity option (if patient wants to share story but not name, use pseudonym)

---

### Sensitive Situations

**Loss & Memorial Stories**:

- Approach family gently (express condolences first, wait appropriate time before asking)
- Ensure family wants to share (don't pressure—some need privacy in grief)
- Honor patient's memory (family reviews, approves story)

**Pediatric Stories**:

- Parental consent required (both parents if possible)
- Child's assent (if old enough—ask "Is it OK if we share your story?")
- Limit identifying info (school name, city—protect child's privacy)

**Mental Health Struggles**:

- Handle carefully (depression, suicidal ideation—don't glamorize, provide resources)
- Trigger warnings (if story discusses self-harm, give readers heads-up)
- Resource links (988 Suicide Hotline, crisis text line—always include)

---

## Story Bank Management

### Organizing the Story Bank

**Story Database** (Airtable or CRM):

- **Fields**: Patient name, story type (diagnosis, living well, advocacy), publication date, channels used, consent status, contact info
- **Tags**: Genotype (ZZ, MZ), disease stage (mild, severe, transplant), demographics (age, gender, race), themes (career, parenting, advocacy)
- **Status**: Draft, approved, published, archived

**Search & Filter**:

- Need diagnosis story for physician education → filter by "Diagnosis" tag
- Need diverse representation → filter by race, age, gender (ensure balance)
- Need advocacy story for legislative campaign → filter by "Advocacy" tag

---

### Story Lifecycle

**1. Collection**: Interview patient, gather photos, draft story
**2. Approval**: Patient reviews, approves final version
**3. Publication**: Publish on Alpha1Life.com, share on social media
**4. Promotion**: Feature in newsletter, use in fundraising, advocacy campaigns
**5. Refresh**: Re-share old stories periodically ("Throwback Thursday: Remember Jessica's story?")
**6. Update**: Check in with patient annually ("How are you? Any updates to your story?")
**7. Archive**: If patient requests removal or passes away (mark archived, don't delete—preserve history)
