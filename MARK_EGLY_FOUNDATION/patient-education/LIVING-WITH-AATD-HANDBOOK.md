## Daily Health Management

### Morning Routine

**Medications & Treatments**:

- ✅ Take prescribed inhalers/medications
- ✅ Check oxygen saturation (if you have pulse oximeter)
- ✅ Do breathing exercises (5-10 minutes)

**Self-Assessment**:

- How's my breathing today?
- Any new symptoms?
- Energy level?

**Planning**:

- Schedule activities during high-energy times
- Pace yourself (don't overdo it)

---

### Throughout the Day

**Energy Conservation**:

- Sit when you can (e.g., sit while getting dressed, cooking)
- Use assistive devices (shower chair, grabber tools)
- Take breaks before you get tired
- Delegate heavy tasks

**Breathing Techniques**:

- **Pursed-lip breathing**: Breathe in through nose, exhale slowly through pursed lips
- **Diaphragmatic breathing**: Use belly, not chest
- Use during shortness of breath episodes

**Hydration**:

- Drink 6-8 glasses of water daily
- Keeps mucus thin and easier to cough up

**Avoid Triggers**:

- Smoke (cigarettes, vaping, secondhand smoke)
- Air pollution (stay inside on high pollution days)
- Strong scents (perfumes, cleaners, paint)
- Dust and mold

---

### Evening Routine

**Medications**:

- Take evening medications as prescribed
- Prepare tomorrow's meds

**Symptom Tracking**:

- Log any symptoms in journal or app
- Note activity level and how you felt

**Relaxation**:

- Stress management (meditation, reading, gentle stretching)
- Good sleep hygiene (cool room, dark, quiet)

---

## Nutrition & Exercise

### Nutrition for AATD

**Goals**:

- Maintain healthy weight
- Support immune system
- Reduce inflammation
- Preserve muscle mass

**What to Eat**:

- ✅ **Protein**: Lean meats, fish, eggs, beans (maintain muscle)
- ✅ **Fruits & vegetables**: Antioxidants, vitamins (5+ servings/day)
- ✅ **Whole grains**: Energy, fiber
- ✅ **Healthy fats**: Omega-3s (fish, nuts, olive oil) reduce inflammation
- ✅ **Water**: Stay hydrated

**What to Limit**:

- ❌ **Processed foods**: High sodium (can cause fluid retention)
- ❌ **Alcohol**: Hard on liver (especially if liver disease present)
- ❌ **Sugary foods**: Can cause energy crashes

---

### Weight Management

**If underweight** (common with advanced lung disease):

- Eat smaller, frequent meals (5-6 per day)
- Add calories with healthy fats (nut butters, avocado, olive oil)
- Protein shakes or supplements
- Talk to dietitian about appetite stimulants

**If overweight**:

- Extra weight makes breathing harder
- Work with dietitian on gradual weight loss
- Focus on nutrient-dense, lower-calorie foods
- Gentle exercise as tolerated

---

### Exercise & Activity

**Why exercise matters**:

- ✅ Improves lung function
- ✅ Strengthens muscles (including breathing muscles)
- ✅ Boosts energy and mood
- ✅ Slows disease progression

**Types of exercise**:

**1. Aerobic (Cardio)**:

- Walking, swimming, cycling, dancing
- Start with 5-10 minutes, gradually increase
- Goal: 20-30 minutes, 3-5 times per week
- Use pursed-lip breathing during activity

**2. Strength Training**:

- Light weights or resistance bands
- Focus on arms, legs, core
- 2-3 times per week
- Helps with daily activities

**3. Flexibility**:

- Stretching, yoga, tai chi
- Improves posture and breathing
- Daily or several times per week

**4. Breathing Exercises**:

- Diaphragmatic breathing
- Incentive spirometry
- 5-10 minutes, 2-3 times daily

---

### Pulmonary Rehabilitation

**What it is**:

- Supervised exercise and education program
- Typically 6-12 weeks, 2-3 sessions per week
- Led by respiratory therapists

**What you'll do**:

- Monitored exercise (treadmill, bike, weights)
- Breathing techniques
- Energy conservation strategies
- Education on COPD/AATD management
- Nutritional counseling
- Emotional support

**Why it helps**:

---

## Managing Symptoms

### Shortness of Breath

**Immediate relief**:

1. Stop activity and rest
2. Use pursed-lip breathing
3. Find comfortable position:
   - Sit and lean forward, arms on knees
   - Stand and lean against wall
   - Tripod position
4. Use rescue inhaler if prescribed
5. Stay calm (anxiety makes it worse)

**When to call doctor**:

- Shortness of breath is new or worsening
- Doesn't improve with rest or inhaler
- Accompanied by chest pain or confusion

**When to call 911**:

- Severe shortness of breath
- Blue lips or fingernails
- Chest pain
- Confusion or fainting

---

### Chronic Cough

**Management**:

- Stay hydrated (thins mucus)

- Cough with fever
- Yellow/green mucus (possible infection)
- Cough keeping you awake

---

### Fatigue

**Causes**:
