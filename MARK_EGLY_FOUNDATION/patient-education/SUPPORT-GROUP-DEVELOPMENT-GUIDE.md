## Support Group Overview

### What is an AATD Support Group?

**AATD Support Groups** are peer-led communities where patients, families, and caregivers:

- ✅ **Share experiences** (diagnosis stories, treatment challenges, coping strategies)
- ✅ **Provide emotional support** (reduce isolation, normalize feelings, offer hope)
- ✅ **Exchange practical advice** (insurance tips, travel with oxygen, workplace accommodations)
- ✅ **Build friendships** (lasting connections with people who "get it")
- ✅ **Advocate together** (organize for policy change, awareness campaigns)

**NOT therapy or medical treatment**:

- Groups are peer support (not professional counseling—though some have guest therapists)
- No medical advice given (share experiences, always defer to doctors)
- Supplement, don't replace professional care

---

### Foundation's Support Group Network

**Vision**: 200 support groups nationwide by 2030 (covering every major metro + virtual options)

**Year 1 Goals** (2026):

- 25 groups launched (15 virtual, 10 in-person)
- 500 participants (20 members per group average)
- 50 trained group leaders

**Year 3 Goals** (2028):

- 100 groups (60 virtual, 40 in-person)
- 2,000 participants
- 150 trained leaders

**Year 5 Goals** (2030):

- 200 groups (100 virtual, 100 in-person)
- 5,000 participants (5% of diagnosed US AATD population)
- 300 trained leaders

---

## Why Support Groups Matter

### The Evidence

**Research shows support groups improve outcomes**:

- **Mental Health**: 40% reduction in depression/anxiety symptoms (vs. isolated patients)
- **Treatment Adherence**: 2x more likely to continue augmentation therapy (peer accountability)
- **Quality of Life**: Higher reported QOL scores (social connection = wellbeing)
- **Healthcare Utilization**: 15% fewer ER visits (peer advice prevents panic, unnecessary visits)
- **Advocacy Engagement**: 5x more likely to contact legislators (collective action)

**Source**: Chronic Disease Self-Management Studies (Stanford, NIH)

### Patient Testimonials

**"Support group saved my marriage"** - Tom, 58, ZZ AATD

> "My wife didn't understand why I was tired all the time. She thought I was lazy. At support group, I met other spouses who 'got it.' Now she comes to meetings with me. We're a team again."

**"I found hope when I had none"** - Lisa, 42, newly diagnosed

> "My doctor said 'You have AATD, average lifespan is 50-60.' I went home and cried for days. Then I found a support group. Met a 72-year-old ZZ woman who hikes, gardens, lives fully. That's when I realized: I can still have a life."

**"We passed a law together"** - Maria, parent advocate

> "At our support group, 20 parents of AATD kids decided to fight for newborn screening. We organized, testified, lobbied. Two years later, our state passed the bill. That's the power of community."

---

## Types of Support Groups

### 1. General AATD Support Groups

**Who**: All AATD patients (any genotype, any stage)

**Focus**: Broad support, diagnosis stories, treatment, lifestyle, advocacy

**Best For**: Newly diagnosed, patients without access to specialized groups

**Meeting Frequency**: Monthly (90-minute meetings)

**Size**: 10-25 members (ideal: 15)

---

### 2. Specialized Support Groups

**Women with AATD**:

- Focus: Pregnancy, hormones, menopause, work-life balance, body image
- Why: Women face unique challenges (fertility concerns, childcare + chronic illness, gender bias in healthcare)

**Young Adults with AATD** (ages 18-35):

- Focus: Dating, career planning, starting families, financial planning, insurance
- Why: Different life stage challenges (building career vs. managing illness, student loans + medical debt)

**Parents of Pediatric AATD**:

- Focus: Liver disease management, genetic guilt, school advocacy, siblings, transition to adult care
- Why: Parenting a sick child is isolating, parents need peer support

**Caregivers & Family Members**:

- Focus: Caregiver burnout, communication, setting boundaries, self-care
- Why: Caregivers often neglect own needs, need space to share frustrations

**Pre-Transplant & Transplant Recipients**:

- Focus: Transplant anxiety, recovery, rejection, lifelong immunosuppression, survivor guilt
- Why: Transplant is traumatic, peer support from those who've been there is invaluable

**Carriers (MZ, MS, SZ)**:

- Focus: Health monitoring, risk management, family testing, genetic counseling
- Why: Carriers often dismissed by doctors ("You're just a carrier"), but new research shows health risks

---

### 3. Regional In-Person Groups

**Why Location Matters**:

- Local friendships (coffee dates, hospital visits, emergency support)
- Community advocacy (organize awareness walks, meet local legislators)
- Cultural relevance (regional healthcare systems, local resources)

**Target Cities** (Year 1—10 groups):

- Cleveland, OH (Cleveland Clinic—AATD center of excellence)
- Denver, CO (National Jewish Health—major AATD research center)
- Los Angeles, CA (large population, UCLA medical center)
- Chicago, IL (major metro, Northwestern pulmonary program)
- New York, NY (large population, Columbia/NYU programs)
- Boston, MA (Harvard/Brigham research, large medical community)
- Houston, TX (Methodist pulmonary program)
- Phoenix, AZ (large retiree population, Mayo Clinic)
- Seattle, WA (UW medical center)
- Tampa, FL (large AATD population, retirees)

**Expansion** (Year 2-5): Add 30 more cities (covering all states)

---

### 4. Virtual Support Groups

**Advantages**:

- **Accessibility**: Rural patients, homebound, oxygen-dependent (can't travel)
- **Scheduling**: Evening groups accommodate work schedules
- **Specialized**: Can form niche groups (rare variants, very young patients) even with small numbers
- **Geographic Diversity**: Learn from patients across country (different healthcare systems, insurance)

**Platforms**: Zoom (free for <40 minutes, paid $150/year for unlimited)

**Types**:

- **General Virtual Group**: Open to all, monthly meetings
- **Oxygen Users Group**: Patients on supplemental O2, share travel tips, equipment reviews
- **Night Owls Group**: For West Coast + insomniacs (9pm PT meetings)
- **Spanish-Language Group**: Serve Hispanic AATD community

---

## Starting a Support Group

### Step 1: Identify a Leader

**Who Makes a Good Group Leader?**:

- ✅ AATD patient, family member, or caregiver (lived experience)
- ✅ Empathetic listener (not advice-giver—facilitator, not expert)
- ✅ Organized (schedule meetings, send reminders, track attendance)
- ✅ Reliable (commits to 1-year minimum, consistent attendance)
- ✅ Trained (completes Foundation's Group Leader Training—8 hours)

**Leader Responsibilities** (5-8 hours/month):

- Facilitate meetings (1.5 hours/month + 30 min prep)
- Send reminders (email/text participants 1 week before, 1 day before)
- Report to Foundation (attendance, topics discussed, concerns—30 min/month)
- Enforce guidelines (respectful environment, confidentiality)
- Crisis management (connect distressed members to resources)

**Leader Benefits**:

- Training (free 8-hour course—facilitation skills, crisis intervention)
- Stipend (Year 2+: $500/year—recognize time commitment)
- Community (leader peer group—monthly calls with other leaders)
- Recognition (annual Leader Appreciation Award)

---

### Step 2: Foundation Approval

**Application Process**:

1. **Submit Application**: Online form (name, AATD story, why you want to lead, preferred group type)
2. **Phone Interview**: Foundation staff (30 min—assess fit, discuss expectations)
3. **Background Check**: Standard (ensure safety—no violent crimes, abuse history)
4. **Training**: Complete 8-hour Group Leader Training (virtual course)
5. **Approval**: Receive Leader Kit (resources, meeting templates, crisis protocols)

**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks (application → approval)

---

### Step 3: Plan Your Group

**Define Your Group**:

- **Type**: General or specialized? (e.g., "Cleveland General AATD Support" or "Virtual Pre-Transplant Group")
- **Format**: Virtual or in-person?
- **Frequency**: Monthly or bi-weekly?
- **Meeting Time**: Evening (6-7:30pm) or weekend (Saturday 10am)?
- **Size**: Target 10-20 members (start small, grow organically)

**Set Ground Rules** (discussed at first meeting):

- Confidentiality (what's shared in group stays in group)
- Respect (no interrupting, judgmental comments, unsolicited advice)
- No medical advice (share experiences, not prescriptions)
- Equal airtime (everyone gets to share, no one dominates)
- Crisis protocol (if someone shares suicidal thoughts, leader connects to resources)

---

### Step 4: Recruit Members

**Foundation Assistance**:

- Listed on Alpha1Life.com (Support Group Finder—map + directory)
- Promoted via Foundation email list (sent to patients in your region)
- Social media posts (Facebook, Instagram—"New group forming in Cleveland!")
- Flyers (provided by Foundation—post at pulmonologist offices, hospitals)

**Personal Outreach**:

- Share on your social media (personal Facebook, AATD groups)
- Ask your pulmonologist to refer patients
- Invite AATD friends (people you met online, at conferences)

**First Meeting Goal**: 5-10 attendees (small is OK—grows over time)

---

### Step 5: Launch Your First Meeting

**Meeting Structure** (see detailed guide below)

**First Meeting Agenda** (90 minutes):

1. **Welcome & Introductions** (30 min): Everyone shares name, diagnosis story, what they hope to gain
2. **Ground Rules** (10 min): Leader explains confidentiality, respect, no medical advice
3. **Topic Discussion** (30 min): Light topic for first meeting ("What symptoms led to your diagnosis?")
4. **Q&A & Resources** (15 min): Share Foundation resources, answer logistics questions
5. **Closing & Next Steps** (5 min): Schedule next meeting, exchange contact info (optional)

**After First Meeting**:

- Send thank-you email (within 24 hours—"Great to meet you, see you next month!")
- Get feedback ("What topics do you want to discuss? What time works best?")
- Report to Foundation (attendance, how it went, any concerns)

---

---

## Virtual vs. In-Person Groups

### Virtual Groups (Zoom)

**Advantages**:

- Accessible (rural patients, homebound, oxygen users who can't travel)
- Convenient (no commute, pajamas OK)
- Recorded (absent members can watch later—with permission)
- Specialized (rare variant patients can find peers nationwide)

**Challenges**:

- Less personal (harder to read body language, build deep connections)
- Tech barriers (older members struggle with Zoom)
- "Zoom fatigue" (screen time exhausting)

**Best Practices**:

- **Cameras on encouraged** (not required—but builds connection)
- **Mute when not speaking** (reduce background noise)
- **Chat feature** (share links, resources, side comments)
- **Breakout rooms** (Year 2+: split large groups for small-group discussions)
- **Recording policy** (ask permission, post to Alpha1Life.com for absent members)

---

### In-Person Groups

**Advantages**:

- Deeper connections (hugs, eye contact, body language)
- Social time (coffee before/after, friendships extend beyond meetings)
- Local advocacy (organize awareness walks, meet legislators together)

**Challenges**:

- Accessibility (oxygen users, wheelchair users, rural patients can't attend)
- Weather/travel (winter storms, traffic, parking)
- Venue costs (need free space—library, church, hospital)

**Best Practices**:

- **Accessible venue** (wheelchair ramps, elevators, handicap parking)
- **Consistent location** (same place each month—easy to remember)
- **Snacks** (coffee, tea, light snacks—welcoming atmosphere)
- **Name tags** (first meetings, new members—help with names)
- **Virtual option** (Year 2+: hybrid meetings—Zoom + in-person)

---

## Safety & Crisis Management

### Confidentiality Rules

**What is Confidential**:

- ✅ Personal stories shared in group (diagnosis, treatment, family issues)
- ✅ Names and identifying details (don't post photos without permission)
- ✅ Sensitive topics (mental health struggles, financial hardship, relationship problems)

**What Can Be Shared**:

- ✅ General topics discussed (e.g., "We talked about managing fatigue")
- ✅ Resources mentioned (links to articles, product recommendations)
- ✅ Your own story (you control what you share about yourself)

**Violations**: If member violates confidentiality → warning (first time), removed from group (repeat offense)

---

### Crisis Protocol

**If Member Shares Suicidal Thoughts or Severe Distress**:

**During Meeting**:

1. **Acknowledge** ("Thank you for sharing. That sounds really hard.")
2. **Connect to resources** ("I want to make sure you're safe. Can we talk after the meeting?")
3. **Don't panic** (stay calm, model that it's OK to ask for help)

**After Meeting** (within 1 hour):

1. **Talk privately** ("Are you safe right now? Do you have a plan to hurt yourself?")
2. **Provide resources**:
   - 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (call or text)
   - Crisis Text Line (text HOME to 741741)
   - Local ER (if immediate danger)
3. **Contact Foundation** (Patient Navigator—within 24 hours, they'll follow up)
4. **Follow up** (check in 48 hours later, 1 week later)

**Leader Boundaries**:

- You are **not a therapist** (refer to professionals—don't try to "fix" them)
- You are **not responsible** for their safety (provide resources, encourage professional help, but their choices are their own)
- **Report to Foundation** (Navigator can provide more intensive support)

---

### Handling Difficult Situations

**Member Dominates Conversation**:

- Gently interrupt: "Thanks for sharing, Maria. Let's hear from others who haven't spoken yet."
- Use timer: "We have 5 minutes left—anyone else want to share?"

**Conflict Between Members**:

- Remind ground rules: "Let's remember to respect different perspectives."
- Redirect: "It sounds like you disagree. That's OK—we don't all have to agree. Let's hear other viewpoints."
- Offline resolution: "This seems heated. Let's talk offline and move on for now."

**Medical Misinformation Shared**:

- Correct gently: "I've heard that too, but I think the research says something different. Let's check Alpha1Life.com resources."
- Defer to experts: "That's a medical question—best to ask your pulmonologist."
- Don't shame: "It's easy to get confused with all the info out there."

**Member Promotes Product/MLM**:

- Stop immediately: "We don't allow product promotion in this group. Please save sales pitches for outside."
- Enforce consequences: Warning (first time), removal (repeat offense)
