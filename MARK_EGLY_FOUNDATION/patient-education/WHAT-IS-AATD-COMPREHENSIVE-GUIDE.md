## What is AATD?

### The Basics

**Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD)** is a genetic condition that can cause lung disease and liver disease.

**In simple terms**:

- Your body doesn't make enough of a protein called **alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT)**
- This protein protects your lungs and liver from damage
- Without enough AAT, your lungs and liver can become damaged over time

---

### The AAT Protein: Your Body's Protector

**What AAT does**:

- 🫁 **Protects your lungs**: AAT neutralizes harmful enzymes (like neutrophil elastase) that can damage lung tissue
- 🩸 **Made in your liver**: Your liver produces AAT and releases it into your bloodstream
- 🛡️ **Travels throughout your body**: AAT circulates in your blood, protecting tissues wherever it's needed

**When you have AATD**:

- Your liver doesn't make enough AAT, or
- Your liver makes abnormal AAT that gets stuck in liver cells instead of entering your bloodstream
- Either way, your lungs don't get the protection they need

---

### How Common is AATD?

**In the United States**:

- Approximately **1 in 2,500** people have severe AATD (ZZ type)
- Estimated **100,000-130,000** people diagnosed with AATD
- Estimated **300,000+** people have AATD but don't know it yet

**Worldwide**:

- Most common in people of European descent (especially Northern Europe)
- Less common in African, Asian, and Hispanic populations (but still possible)

**Why so many undiagnosed?**

- AATD symptoms mimic common conditions like asthma or COPD
- Many doctors don't think to test for it
- Average diagnostic delay: **7-8 years**

---

## How AATD Affects Your Body

### Lung Disease (Most Common)

**What happens**:

- Without enough AAT to protect your lungs, enzymes break down lung tissue
- This leads to **emphysema** (a type of COPD)
- Lungs lose elasticity and can't expand/contract properly
- Breathing becomes difficult

**Timeline**:

- **Severe AATD (ZZ)**: Emphysema typically develops in 30s-50s
- **Much earlier** than typical COPD (usually 60s-70s)
- **Smoking accelerates damage dramatically** (can develop in 20s-30s)

**Symptoms**:

- Shortness of breath (especially with activity)
- Chronic cough
- Wheezing
- Frequent respiratory infections
- Fatigue

---

### Liver Disease (Less Common, But Serious)

**What happens**:

- Abnormal AAT protein gets stuck in liver cells
- This can cause inflammation and scarring (**cirrhosis**)
- In severe cases, liver failure

**Who gets liver disease**:

- **Children**: 10-15% of babies with severe AATD develop liver disease
  - Usually improves by age 2-4, but some progress to cirrhosis
- **Adults**: 30-40% develop liver problems later in life
  - Risk increases with age, especially after 50

**Symptoms**:

- Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes)
- Abdominal swelling (ascites)
- Fatigue
- Easy bruising or bleeding
- Itchy skin

---

### Other Possible Effects (Rare)

**Skin condition**: Necrotizing panniculitis

- Painful lumps or ulcers on skin
- Rare (1-2% of AATD patients)

**Vasculitis**: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's)

- Inflammation of blood vessels
- Extremely rare

---

## Genetics & Inheritance

### How AATD is Inherited

**AATD is genetic**: Passed from parents to children through genes

**The SERPINA1 gene**:

- This gene tells your body how to make AAT protein
- Everyone inherits **2 copies** of this gene (1 from each parent)
- Normal gene is called **M**
- Abnormal genes are called **Z**, **S**, and others

---

### Common Genotypes

**MM (Normal)**:

- 2 normal genes
- Normal AAT levels (~150-250 mg/dL)
- **No AATD**

**MZ (Carrier)**:

- 1 normal gene, 1 Z gene
- Slightly low AAT levels (~90-150 mg/dL)
- Usually **no symptoms**
- Can pass Z gene to children

**MS (Carrier)**:

- 1 normal gene, 1 S gene
- Slightly low AAT levels (~100-150 mg/dL)
- Usually **no symptoms**
- Can pass S gene to children

**ZZ (Severe AATD)**:

- 2 Z genes
- Very low AAT levels (~10-50 mg/dL)
- **High risk** for lung and liver disease
- Most common severe form

**SZ (Moderate AATD)**:

- 1 S gene, 1 Z gene
- Low AAT levels (~60-90 mg/dL)
- **Moderate risk** for lung disease (especially if smoker)

---

### Inheritance Patterns

**If both parents are MZ carriers**:

- 25% chance: Child has MM (normal)
- 50% chance: Child has MZ (carrier, like parents)
- 25% chance: Child has ZZ (severe AATD)

**If one parent is ZZ and one is MM**:

- 100% chance: Child has MZ (carrier)

**If one parent is ZZ and one is MZ**:

- 50% chance: Child has ZZ (severe AATD)
- 50% chance: Child has MZ (carrier)

---

### Family Testing

**If you have AATD, your family members should be tested**:

- **Siblings**: 25% chance of having same genotype (if parents are carriers)
- **Children**: 50-100% chance of being carriers (depending on other parent)
- **Parents**: Likely carriers (if you have ZZ)

**Testing is simple**: One blood test

---

## Symptoms & Warning Signs

### Early Symptoms (Often Missed or Misdiagnosed)

**Lung-related**:

- Shortness of breath during exercise or daily activities
- Chronic cough (lasting weeks or months)
- Wheezing
- Frequent colds or respiratory infections
- Feeling tired all the time

**Liver-related** (infants):

- Prolonged jaundice (yellowing) after birth
- Slow growth or poor weight gain
- Enlarged liver or spleen

**Liver-related** (adults):

- Abdominal swelling
- Yellowing of skin or eyes
- Unexplained liver enzyme elevations (on blood tests)

---

### Red Flags That Suggest AATD

**You should ask your doctor about AATD testing if**:

- ✅ You have **emphysema or COPD** before age 45
- ✅ You're a **non-smoker** (or light smoker) with COPD
- ✅ You have **asthma that doesn't respond** to treatment
- ✅ You have **unexplained liver disease** (any age)
- ✅ You have a **family history** of AATD, early emphysema, or liver disease
- ✅ You have **bronchiectasis** without obvious cause
- ✅ You work in **high-risk occupation** (firefighter, military, miner)

---

### Progression of Lung Disease

**Without treatment**:

- Lung function declines over time
- Shortness of breath worsens
- May require oxygen therapy
- Severe cases: Lung transplant

**Rate of decline varies**:

- **Smokers**: Very rapid decline (10-15 years faster than non-smokers)
- **Non-smokers**: Slower decline, but still progressive
- **With treatment (augmentation therapy)**: Slows decline significantly

---

## Who is at Risk?

### High-Risk Groups

**1. People with early-onset lung disease**:

- COPD or emphysema diagnosed before age 45
- Especially non-smokers or light smokers

**2. People with unexplained liver disease**:

- Chronic hepatitis (not caused by viruses or alcohol)
- Cirrhosis of unknown cause
- Infants with prolonged jaundice

**3. Family members of AATD patients**:

- Siblings, children, parents
- Higher chance of carrying AATD genes

**4. People with chronic respiratory symptoms**:

- Persistent cough, wheezing, shortness of breath
- Frequent respiratory infections
- Asthma that doesn't improve with treatment

**5. High-risk occupations**:

- **Firefighters**: Smoke exposure damages lungs faster
- **Military personnel**: Burn pit exposure, dust
- **Miners**: Dust inhalation
- **Factory workers**: Chemical or dust exposure

---

### Ancestry & Ethnicity

**Most common in**:

- Northern European descent (Scandinavian, British, Irish, German)
- 1 in 2,500 have severe AATD (ZZ)

**Less common (but still possible) in**:

- Southern European
- Middle Eastern
- Hispanic/Latino
- African American
- Asian

**Important**: AATD can occur in ANY ethnicity. Don't rule it out based on ancestry alone.

---

## Diagnosis

### How AATD is Diagnosed

**Step 1: Blood Test (AAT Level)**

- Measures amount of AAT protein in your blood
- **Normal**: >150 mg/dL
- **Low**: <100 mg/dL → proceed to genetic testing

**Step 2: Genetic Testing (Genotyping)**

- Identifies which genes you have (MM, MZ, ZZ, etc.)
- Confirms AATD diagnosis
- Determines severity

**Step 3: Additional Tests (to assess lung/liver damage)**

- **Spirometry** (lung function test)
- **CT scan** (chest imaging)
- **Liver function tests** (blood tests)
- **Liver biopsy** (if severe liver disease suspected)

---

### The Diagnostic Delay Problem

**Why does it take so long to diagnose?**

**Average delay**: 7-8 years from first symptoms to diagnosis

**Reasons**:

1. Symptoms mimic common conditions (asthma, COPD, bronchitis)
2. Many doctors don't think to test for AATD (it's "rare")
3. Patients see multiple doctors before someone orders the right test
4. AATD isn't taught extensively in medical school

**Common misdiagnoses**:

- Asthma
- COPD (without investigating cause)
- Chronic bronchitis
- Anxiety (when shortness of breath is dismissed)

---

### Why Early Diagnosis Matters

**Benefits of early diagnosis**:

- ✅ Start treatment sooner (augmentation therapy slows lung damage)
- ✅ Make lifestyle changes (quit smoking, avoid lung irritants)
- ✅ Monitor lung and liver health proactively
- ✅ Inform family members (they can get tested)
- ✅ Access clinical trials and new treatments
- ✅ Avoid years of frustration and worsening health

**Every year of delay = more irreversible lung damage**

---

- **Liver disease treatment**: Monitoring, medications, transplant if severe
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Smoking cessation, exercise, nutrition

---

## Common Questions

### "Is AATD the same as COPD?"

No. AATD is a **cause** of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).

- COPD is a general term for lung diseases that obstruct airflow (emphysema, chronic bronchitis)
- AATD causes emphysema (a type of COPD)
- Most COPD is caused by smoking, but AATD causes COPD even in non-smokers

---

### "Can AATD be cured?"

No cure currently exists, but:

- **Augmentation therapy** slows lung disease progression
- **Lung transplant** can replace damaged lungs (but doesn't cure AATD)
- **Liver transplant** cures liver disease (transplanted liver makes normal AAT)
- **Gene therapy** research is underway (potential future cure)

---

### "Will I pass AATD to my children?"

**Depends on your genotype and your partner's genotype**:

- If you're **ZZ** and partner is **MM**: All children will be **MZ** carriers (usually no symptoms)
- If you're **ZZ** and partner is **MZ**: 50% chance children have **ZZ**
- If you're **MZ** carrier and partner is **MM**: 50% chance children are **MZ** carriers

**Genetic counseling recommended** before having children

---

### "I'm a carrier (MZ). Will I get sick?"

**Usually not**.

- MZ carriers have slightly low AAT levels but usually no symptoms
- Risk increases if you:
  - Smoke (quit!)
  - Have occupational exposures (firefighter, military)
  - Have other lung disease risk factors

**What to do**:

- Don't smoke (ever)
- Avoid lung irritants
- Monitor lung function (spirometry every few years)
- Inform your doctor so they watch for symptoms

---

### "I just got diagnosed. What should I do first?"

**Take a breath. You've got this.**

**First steps**:

1. **Educate yourself**: Read this guide, talk to your doctor, join support groups
2. **Find a specialist**: Pulmonologist experienced in AATD (AATD Aware Certified provider)
3. **Get baseline tests**: Spirometry, CT scan, liver function tests
4. **Discuss treatment**: Is augmentation therapy right for you?
5. **Make lifestyle changes**: Quit smoking, exercise, vaccinations
6. **Tell your family**: Siblings, children, parents should get tested
7. **Connect with community**: You're not alone

- ✅ Mark Egly Foundation provides financial assistance (see Grants OUT program)
- ✅ You should not have to pay full cost out-of-pocket

**Contact our patient navigation team**: We'll help you access treatment and navigate insurance

---

### "Can I still work/travel/live normally?"

**Yes, for many people with AATD**:

- Early diagnosis and treatment allow most people to maintain quality of life
- Some people need to modify activities (avoid strenuous exertion if severe)
- Some people require oxygen therapy (portable concentrators available)
- With proper management, many AATD patients work full-time, travel, and enjoy life

**It's a spectrum**: Some people have mild disease, others severe. Early detection makes a huge difference.

---

### "Should I tell my employer?"

**Up to you**:

- You're not legally required to disclose (in most cases)
- Consider disclosing if:
  - You need accommodations (avoid dust/fumes, flexible schedule for infusions)
  - Your job has high lung exposure risk (firefighter, factory)
  - You qualify for disability benefits

**Protected by law**:

- Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) protects against discrimination
- Employer must provide reasonable accommodations

**We advocate for workplace protections**: See our Advocacy & Policy documents
