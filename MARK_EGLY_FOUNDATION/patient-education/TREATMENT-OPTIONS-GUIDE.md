- ✅ Extend life expectancy

---

### Treatment Approach by Genotype

**ZZ Genotype (Severe AATD)**:

- Augmentation therapy (if lung disease present or preventive)
- COPD medications
- Pulmonary rehabilitation
- Lifestyle modifications
- Regular monitoring

**SZ Genotype (Moderate AATD)**:

- Case-by-case (may qualify for augmentation therapy)
- COPD medications
- Lifestyle modifications
- Monitoring

**MZ/MS Genotype (Carrier)**:

- Usually no specific AATD treatment needed
- Standard COPD management (if symptoms present)
- Focus on prevention (don't smoke, avoid irritants)
- Monitoring

---

## Augmentation Therapy

### What Is Augmentation Therapy?

**Also called**: Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor therapy, AAT replacement therapy

**What it is**:

- Weekly IV infusions of purified AAT protein
- Derived from donated human blood plasma
- Raises AAT levels in blood and lungs
- Slows progression of lung disease

**The only treatment that addresses root cause of AATD lung disease**

---

### How It Works

**Normal AAT protects lungs**:

- Neutrophil elastase (enzyme) breaks down lung tissue
- AAT protein blocks neutrophil elastase
- In AATD: Not enough AAT → unchecked elastase → emphysema

**Augmentation therapy**:

- Infuses AAT protein → raises blood level
- AAT reaches lungs → protects from elastase damage
- Slows emphysema progression

**Does NOT cure AATD**: You still have genetic mutation, but treatment replaces missing protein

---

### Who Is Candidate for Augmentation Therapy?

**FDA-approved for**:

- Genotype ZZ, SZ, or other severe deficiency (AAT level <80 mg/dL)
- Evidence of lung disease (FEV1 between 30-80% predicted)

**American Thoracic Society guidelines**:

- AAT level <57 mg/dL (or <11 µM)
- FEV1 <80% predicted
- Non-smoker or former smoker (quit at least 6 months ago)

**Off-label uses** (not FDA-approved but sometimes prescribed):

- Preventive (ZZ with normal lung function)
- Lung disease with FEV1 >80%
- MZ with significant lung disease

**NOT recommended if**:

- Currently smoking (must quit first)
- FEV1 <30% predicted (very severe disease, limited benefit)
- IgA deficiency (risk of allergic reaction)

---

### How Augmentation Therapy Is Given

**Frequency**: Once weekly

**Duration**: Typically 1-2 hours per infusion

**Location**:

- **Infusion center**: Hospital or clinic
- **Doctor's office**
- **Home infusion**: Nurse comes to you (preferred by many patients)

**Process**:

1. Check vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, temperature)
2. Insert IV catheter (usually in arm)
3. Infuse AAT over 1-2 hours
4. Monitor for reactions
5. Remove IV, apply bandage
6. Go home (no recovery time needed)

**For frequent IVs**: Some patients get port (permanent IV access in chest)

---

### Side Effects

**Common (mild)**:

- Headache
- Fatigue
- Dizziness
- Nausea
- Muscle aches
- Fever or chills

**Most side effects resolve quickly** (within 24 hours)

**Tips to minimize side effects**:

- Hydrate before and during infusion
- Take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen before infusion
- Slow infusion rate (discuss with nurse)
- Infuse at night (sleep through side effects)

**Rare but serious**:

- Allergic reaction (hives, difficulty breathing, swelling)
- Blood clots
- Infection from IV

**Call doctor if**:

- Severe allergic reaction
- Fever >101°F
- Severe headache or chest pain

---

### Available Products

**Four FDA-approved augmentation therapy products** (all similar efficacy):

**1. Prolastin-C** (Grifols)

- Original AAT product
- Weekly IV infusion
- 60 mg/kg dose

**2. Zemaira** (CSL Behring)

- Weekly IV infusion
- 60 mg/kg dose

**3. Aralast NP** (Takeda)

- Weekly IV infusion
- 60 mg/kg dose

**4. Glassia** (Takeda)

- Weekly IV infusion
- 60 mg/kg dose

**All are equally effective**: Choice often based on insurance coverage, availability, or patient/doctor preference

---

### Does Augmentation Therapy Work?

**Evidence**:

- ✅ Slows decline in lung function (FEV1)
- ✅ Reduces frequency of exacerbations
- ✅ May improve survival
- ✅ Well-tolerated, safe

**What studies show**:

- Without augmentation: FEV1 declines ~50-100 mL/year
- With augmentation: FEV1 declines ~30-60 mL/year
- **~40% slower decline**

**Best results when started early** (before severe lung damage)

**Does NOT reverse existing damage**: Slows progression, doesn't heal damaged lungs

---

### Cost of Augmentation Therapy

**Expensive**: $100,000-$200,000 per year

**Good news**: Most patients pay very little out-of-pocket

**Insurance coverage**:

- Usually covered by commercial insurance, Medicare, Medicaid
- Requires prior authorization (doctor submits documentation)
- Co-pays vary ($0-$5,000 per year)

**Financial assistance** (see section below):

- Co-pay assistance programs (manufacturers)
- Patient assistance programs (free for uninsured)
- Mark Egly Foundation grants

**Don't let cost deter you**: Financial help is available

---

## Standard COPD Management

### Bronchodilators (Inhalers)

**What they do**: Relax airway muscles → open airways → easier breathing

**Types**:

**1. Short-Acting Bronchodilators (Rescue Inhalers)**:

- **Use**: During shortness of breath episodes
- **How fast they work**: 5-15 minutes
- **Duration**: 4-6 hours
- **Examples**:
  - Albuterol (ProAir, Ventolin, Proventil)
  - Levalbuterol (Xopenex)

**2. Long-Acting Bronchodilators (Maintenance Inhalers)**:

- **Use**: Daily to prevent symptoms
- **How fast they work**: 30 minutes to hours
- **Duration**: 12-24 hours
- **Examples**:
  - LABAs: Formoterol, salmeterol
  - LAMAs: Tiotropium (Spiriva), umeclidinium (Incruse)

**Often combined** with inhaled corticosteroids (see below)

---

### Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS)

**What they do**: Reduce airway inflammation

**Use**: Daily (usually combined with bronchodilator)

**Examples**:

- Fluticasone (Flovent)
- Budesonide (Pulmicort)

**Combination inhalers** (LABA + ICS):

- Advair (fluticasone + salmeterol)
- Symbicort (budesonide + formoterol)
- Breo (fluticasone + vilanterol)

**Triple therapy** (LABA + LAMA + ICS):

- Trelegy (fluticasone + umeclidinium + vilanterol)
- Most effective for moderate-severe COPD

---

### Other Medications

**Oral Corticosteroids (Prednisone)**:

- **Use**: Short-term for exacerbations (flare-ups)
- **Duration**: 5-14 days
- **Side effects**: Weight gain, mood changes, high blood sugar, insomnia
- **Not for long-term use** (serious side effects)

**Antibiotics**:

- **Use**: Bacterial lung infections (exacerbations)
- **Common**: Azithromycin (Z-pack), amoxicillin, doxycycline
- **Keep on hand**: Many doctors prescribe "rescue pack" to start at first sign of infection

**Phosphodiesterase-4 Inhibitors**:

- **Roflumilast (Daliresp)**: Reduces inflammation, prevents exacerbations
- **Use**: Severe COPD with frequent exacerbations
- **Side effects**: Diarrhea, weight loss, nausea

**Mucolytics**:

- **Guaifenesin (Mucinex)**: Thins mucus, easier to cough up
- **N-acetylcysteine (NAC)**: Antioxidant, thins mucus
- **Hypertonic saline**: Nebulized salt water, loosens mucus

---

### Vaccinations

**Essential for AATD patients**:

✅ **Flu vaccine**: Annually (every fall)

- Reduces risk of influenza (can trigger exacerbations)

✅ **Pneumonia vaccines**:

- **Prevnar 20 (PCV20)**: One dose OR
- **Prevnar 15 (PCV15) + Pneumovax 23 (PPSV23)**: Two doses, 1 year apart
- Protects against pneumococcal pneumonia

✅ **COVID-19 vaccine**: Per CDC recommendations (annual boosters)

✅ **Tdap (Tetanus/Diphtheria/Pertussis)**: One dose, then Td booster every 10 years

- Pertussis (whooping cough) dangerous for COPD patients

✅ **RSV vaccine**: For adults 60+ (Abrysvo or Arexvy)

- Respiratory syncytial virus causes severe lung infections

✅ **Shingles vaccine (Shingrix)**: Age 50+

- Two doses, 2-6 months apart

**Ask your doctor**: "Am I up to date on all vaccines?"

---

## Liver Disease Treatment

### Monitoring

**If you have ZZ or SZ genotype**:

- Liver function tests (LFTs) annually
- If elevated → refer to hepatologist

**Liver disease more common in**:

- Children (10-15% develop liver disease)
- Adults with obesity, diabetes, alcohol use

---

### Treatment for Liver Disease

**No specific medication for AATD liver disease**

**Management**:

- ✅ Treat underlying causes (obesity, diabetes, alcohol)
- ✅ Avoid hepatotoxic substances:
  - Alcohol
  - Acetaminophen (Tylenol) overuse
  - Certain medications
- ✅ Get vaccinated (Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B)
- ✅ Monitor for cirrhosis/liver cancer (ultrasound, blood tests)

**If cirrhosis develops**:

- Medications to manage complications (diuretics, beta blockers)
- Screening for liver cancer (ultrasound + AFP blood test every 6 months)
- Liver transplant evaluation (if liver failure)

---

### Liver Transplantation

**When needed**: End-stage liver disease, liver failure

**Outcomes**: Excellent

- Cures liver disease (but not lung disease—still have AATD genotype)
- 5-year survival ~75-85%

**Transplanted liver makes normal AAT**: Some improvement in AAT levels (but usually not enough to prevent lung disease)

---

## Oxygen Therapy

### When Is Oxygen Needed?

**Oxygen prescribed if**:

- Resting oxygen saturation ≤88%
- Oxygen saturation drops during activity
- Oxygen saturation drops during sleep

**Measured with**: Pulse oximeter (clips on finger)

**Normal oxygen saturation**: ≥95%

---

### Types of Oxygen Systems

**1. Oxygen Concentrator (Home)**:

- Plugs into wall outlet
- Extracts oxygen from room air
- Unlimited supply
- Stationary (not portable)

**2. Portable Oxygen Concentrator (POC)**:

- Battery-powered
- Take anywhere (flights, errands, travel)
- More expensive
- Limited battery life (2-8 hours)

**3. Compressed Oxygen Tanks**:

- Small tanks for portability
- Limited supply (need refills)
- Heavier than POCs

**4. Liquid Oxygen**:

- Very cold liquid oxygen in tank
- Portable (refill from large home tank)
- Lasts longer than compressed tanks

---

### How to Use Oxygen

**Delivery**:

- Nasal cannula (plastic tubing in nostrils)
- Face mask (for higher flow rates)

**Flow rate**: Prescribed by doctor (e.g., "2 liters per minute")

- Don't adjust without doctor's permission

**When to use**:

- 24/7 (continuous)
- During activity
- During sleep
- As prescribed by doctor

**Don't skip oxygen**: Low oxygen damages organs (heart, brain)

---

### Oxygen Safety

**Oxygen is safe but flammable**:

- ❌ No smoking (you or others nearby)
- ❌ No open flames (candles, stoves, fireplaces)
- ❌ No sparks (grease, oil)
- ✅ Keep oxygen ≥5 feet from heat sources
- ✅ Post "Oxygen in Use" signs

---

## Pulmonary Rehabilitation

- Breathing techniques
- Energy conservation strategies
- Nutritional counseling
- Emotional support
- Disease education

**Duration**: Typically 6-12 weeks, 2-3 sessions per week

**Where**: Hospital, clinic, or home (virtual programs available)

---

### Benefits of Pulmonary Rehab

**Evidence shows**:

- ✅ Improves exercise tolerance
- ✅ Reduces shortness of breath
- ✅ Increases quality of life
- ✅ Reduces hospitalizations
- ✅ Improves mental health (less anxiety/depression)
- ✅ Builds confidence and self-management skills

**One of most effective treatments for COPD/AATD**

---

### How to Access Pulmonary Rehab

**Step 1**: Ask your doctor for referral

**Step 2**: Insurance approval (usually covered)

**Step 3**: Schedule intake appointment

**Step 4**: Attend sessions (2-3 times per week)

**If you can't attend in-person**:

- Ask about home-based or virtual programs

---

## Lung Transplantation

### When Is Lung Transplant Considered?

**End-stage lung disease**:

- FEV1 <25% predicted
- Severe shortness of breath at rest
- Frequent hospitalizations
- Oxygen-dependent
- Limited life expectancy without transplant

**AATD is common reason for lung transplant**: ~7% of all lung transplants

---

### Types of Lung Transplant

**1. Single Lung Transplant**:

- Replace one lung
- Shorter surgery, faster recovery
- Adequate for many AATD patients

**2. Double Lung Transplant**:

- Replace both lungs
- Better long-term outcomes
- More common for younger patients

---

### Transplant Process

**Step 1: Evaluation**:

- Extensive testing (lung function, CT scan, heart tests, blood work)
- Psychosocial evaluation
- Financial clearance
- Determine if suitable candidate

**Step 2: Wait List**:

- Added to national transplant waiting list (UNOS)
- Wait time: Months to years (depends on urgency, blood type, lung size)
- Lung allocation score (LAS) determines priority

**Step 3: Transplant Surgery**:

- Called when donor lungs available
- Must get to hospital within hours
- Surgery: 6-12 hours

**Step 4: Recovery**:

- ICU: 1-7 days
- Hospital: 2-3 weeks
- Rehab: 3-6 months

**Step 5: Lifelong Follow-Up**:

- Immunosuppressant medications (prevent rejection)
- Frequent monitoring (clinic visits, lung biopsies)
- Watch for rejection, infection

---

### Outcomes

**Success rates**:

- 1-year survival: ~90%
- 5-year survival: ~50-60%
- 10-year survival: ~30-35%

**Quality of life**: Dramatically improved

- Most patients feel much better
- Return to normal activities
- No longer need oxygen

**Transplant cures lung disease BUT**:

- Still have AATD genetics
- Transplanted lungs don't have AATD (donor lungs are normal)
- Liver disease (if present) not affected

---

## Liver Transplantation

### When Needed

**End-stage liver disease**:

- Cirrhosis with complications (ascites, bleeding, confusion)
- Liver cancer
- Liver failure

**Outcomes**: Excellent (see Liver Disease section above)

---

## Lifestyle Interventions

### Smoking Cessation

**THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU CAN DO**

**Smoking with AATD**:

- Lung function declines 10-15 years faster
- Emphysema develops earlier and more severely
- Augmentation therapy less effective

**If you smoke, QUIT NOW**:

- It's never too late (even with advanced disease, quitting helps)
- Lung function decline slows after quitting

**How to quit**:

- **Nicotine replacement**: Patches, gum, lozenges
- **Medications**: Bupropion (Zyban), varenicline (Chantix)
- **Counseling**: Quitline (1-800-QUIT-NOW)
- **Apps**: Smoke Free, QuitGuide
- **Mark Egly Foundation**: Smoking cessation support

**Don't give up**: Most people need 5-7 attempts before successfully quitting

---
