## Should You Get Tested?

### Who Should Be Tested for AATD

**You SHOULD get tested if you have**:

✅ **Early-onset COPD or emphysema**

- Diagnosed before age 45
- Especially if non-smoker or light smoker

✅ **COPD with basilar emphysema**

- CT scan shows damage at bottom of lungs (not typical for smoking-related COPD)

✅ **Asthma that doesn't respond to treatment**

- Persistent symptoms despite medications
- Diagnosis of "difficult-to-treat asthma"

✅ **Unexplained liver disease**

- Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST)
- Cirrhosis of unknown cause
- Chronic hepatitis

✅ **Family history of AATD**

- Parent, sibling, or child diagnosed with AATD
- Multiple family members with early lung disease

✅ **Bronchiectasis**

- Chronic infection and lung scarring

✅ **Panniculitis**

- Painful skin lesions/nodules

✅ **c-ANCA-positive vasculitis**

- Autoimmune blood vessel inflammation

✅ **Family member with AATD**

- Siblings, children, parents, extended family of diagnosed individuals

---

### High-Risk Occupations

**Consider testing if you work in**:

🔥 **Firefighting**

- Smoke exposure increases AATD risk
- Early detection critical for career planning

🎖️ **Military (especially post-9/11)**

- Burn pit exposure
- Deployment in high-pollution areas

⚒️ **Mining or Construction**

- Dust, silica, chemical exposure

🏭 **Manufacturing**

- Industrial fumes, chemicals

🔬 **Laboratory Work**

- Chemical exposure

**Why it matters**: If you have AATD + exposure = accelerated lung damage

---

### When AATD Testing Is Recommended

**Medical organizations recommend testing for**:

**American Thoracic Society (ATS) / European Respiratory Society (ERS)**:

- All patients with COPD
- Adults with asthma with persistent airflow obstruction
- Unexplained liver disease (any age)
- Necrotizing panniculitis
- c-ANCA-positive vasculitis
- First-degree relatives of AATD patients

**World Health Organization (WHO)**:

- All symptomatic adults with COPD

**Bottom line**: If you have ANY chronic lung disease, you should be tested ONCE in your lifetime

---

## Understanding AATD Testing

### The Two-Step Testing Process

**Step 1: AAT Level Test (Quantitative)**

- Measures AMOUNT of AAT protein in your blood
- Simple blood test
- Results: AAT level in mg/dL

**Step 2: Genotype Test (Qualitative)**

- Identifies WHICH mutations you have
- Blood test or cheek swab
- Results: Your genotype (e.g., MM, MZ, ZZ, SZ)

**You need BOTH tests** to fully understand your AATD status

---

### AAT Level Test (Step 1)

**What it measures**: Concentration of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin protein in blood

**Normal range**:

- **Normal**: >150 mg/dL
- **Borderline**: 100-150 mg/dL
- **Low**: <100 mg/dL
- **Severely low**: <50 mg/dL

**What results mean**:
| AAT Level | Likely Genotype | Risk |
|-----------|----------------|------|
| >150 mg/dL | MM (normal) | Very low risk |
| 100-150 mg/dL | MZ or MS (carrier) | Low risk |
| 50-100 mg/dL | SZ (moderate AATD) | Moderate risk |
| <50 mg/dL | ZZ (severe AATD) | High risk |

**Important**: AAT levels can be temporarily elevated during illness/inflammation (acute phase reactant)

**If elevated**: Retest when healthy

---

### Genotype Test (Step 2)

**What it measures**: Specific genetic mutations in SERPINA1 gene

**How it works**:

- Blood sample or cheek swab
- DNA analysis identifies which mutations you carry
- Everyone has 2 copies of gene (1 from each parent)

**Common genotypes**:

| Genotype      | What It Means                     | AAT Level     | Risk                                          |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **MM**        | Normal (2 normal copies)          | >150 mg/dL    | No increased risk                             |
| **MZ**        | Carrier (1 normal, 1 Z mutation)  | 100-150 mg/dL | Slightly increased risk (especially if smoke) |
| **MS**        | Carrier (1 normal, 1 S mutation)  | 120-150 mg/dL | Minimal increased risk                        |
| **ZZ**        | Severe AATD (2 Z mutations)       | 20-45 mg/dL   | High risk of lung/liver disease               |
| **SZ**        | Moderate AATD (1 S, 1 Z mutation) | 50-100 mg/dL  | Moderate risk                                 |
| **SS**        | Mild deficiency (2 S mutations)   | 100-120 mg/dL | Low risk                                      |
| **Null-Null** | Severe AATD (2 null mutations)    | 0-10 mg/dL    | Very high risk                                |

**Rare variants**: Over 100 other rare mutations exist (F, I, P, etc.)

---

### What If I'm a Carrier (MZ or MS)?

**Good news**: Most carriers never develop symptoms

**Risk factors**:

- Smoking (NEVER SMOKE if carrier)
- Environmental exposures (dust, fumes)
- Other lung diseases

**What to do**:

- Don't smoke (or quit immediately)
- Avoid lung irritants
- Get vaccinated (flu, pneumonia, COVID)
- Monitor lung function (baseline spirometry, retest if symptoms)
- Tell family members to get tested

**Life expectancy**: Normal for most carriers (especially non-smokers)

---

- List of current medications
- List of questions

**What to expect**:

- Review of test results and medical history
- Physical exam
- Discussion of symptoms
- Order baseline tests (see below)

---

**2. Baseline Testing (first 1-3 months)**

**Lung function tests**:

- **Spirometry**: Measures lung capacity and airflow
  - FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second): Key metric for tracking disease
  - FVC (forced vital capacity): Total lung capacity
- **Lung volumes**: Additional lung capacity measurements
- **Diffusing capacity (DLCO)**: Measures oxygen transfer
- **Pulse oximetry**: Blood oxygen level
- **6-minute walk test**: Exercise tolerance

**Imaging**:

- **Chest CT scan**: Shows lung damage (emphysema)
  - Basilar-predominant emphysema is classic AATD pattern
  - Quantifies amount of damage

**Liver tests**:

- **Liver function tests (LFTs)**: Blood tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase)
  - If elevated → refer to hepatologist
- **Ultrasound or FibroScan**: Images liver, checks for scarring

**Other**:

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**
- **Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)**

---

**3. Treatment Discussion**

**Questions to ask**:

- Am I a candidate for augmentation therapy?
- What medications do I need?
- Do I need oxygen?
- Should I do pulmonary rehabilitation?
- How often should I be monitored?
- What lifestyle changes should I make?

**Treatment options** (see "Treatment Options Guide" for details):

- Augmentation therapy (IV AAT infusions)
- Bronchodilators (inhalers)
- Pulmonary rehabilitation
- Oxygen therapy
- Lifestyle modifications
- Clinical trials

---

### Creating Your Treatment Plan

**Your doctor will help you create personalized plan**:

**For ZZ patients with lung disease**:

- Augmentation therapy (weekly infusions)
- COPD medications (bronchodilators, steroids)
- Pulmonary rehab
- Regular monitoring (every 3-6 months)

**For ZZ patients without symptoms**:

- Discuss augmentation therapy (preventive)
- Lifestyle modifications
- Monitoring (every 6-12 months)

**For carriers (MZ, MS)**:

- Smoking cessation (if applicable)
- Lifestyle modifications
- Monitoring (baseline, then every 1-5 years)

---

## Family Testing Guide

### Why Family Testing Matters

**AATD is inherited**:

- If you have AATD → family members at risk
- Early detection can prevent disease progression
- Family planning considerations

**Who should be tested**:

- **Siblings**: Same parents = same risk
- **Children**: 50-100% chance of being carriers or affected
- **Parents**: Likely carriers
- **Extended family**: Aunts, uncles, cousins (if family history of lung/liver disease)

---

### How to Talk to Family

**Be calm and informative**:

- "I was diagnosed with a genetic condition called Alpha-1."
- "It's inherited, so you may want to get tested."
- "It's a simple blood test."
- "Early detection can prevent serious problems."

**Provide resources**:

- Share this guide
- Give Mark Egly Foundation contact info
- Offer to help them talk to their doctor

**Don't pressure**:

- Some family members may not be ready
- Respect their decision
- Leave door open: "Let me know if you change your mind."

---

### Cascade Testing

**What it is**: Systematic testing of family members after someone is diagnosed

**How it works**:

1. Index case (you) diagnosed with AATD
2. Doctor or genetic counselor contacts first-degree relatives
3. Relatives offered free or low-cost testing
4. Positive relatives → test THEIR relatives
5. Continues until all at-risk family members tested

**Benefits**:

- Finds undiagnosed family members
- Prevents future disease
- Coordinated by medical team (less burden on you)

**Ask your doctor**: "Do you offer cascade testing for my family?"

---

### Genetic Counseling

**What it is**: Meeting with genetic counselor to discuss AATD inheritance

**When to consider**:

- Planning to have children
- Want help talking to family
- Complex family situation
- Rare genotype or unclear results

**What they'll discuss**:

- How AATD is inherited
- Risk to current/future children
- Family testing strategies
- Reproductive options (genetic testing of embryos, etc.)

**How to find genetic counselor**:

- Ask your doctor for referral
- National Society of Genetic Counselors: findageneticcounselor.com
- Often covered by insurance

---

## Common Questions

### How accurate is AATD testing?

**Very accurate**:

- AAT level test: >99% accuracy
- Genotype test: >99% accuracy
- False positives/negatives extremely rare

**One caveat**: AAT level can be temporarily elevated during illness (acute phase reactant)

- If level borderline high → retest when healthy

---

### Do I need to fast before testing?

**No**: You can eat and drink normally before AATD blood test

---

### Can I do testing while pregnant?

**Yes**: AATD testing is safe during pregnancy

- Standard blood test, no risk to baby

---

### What if I already had genetic testing (23andMe, etc.)?

**Consumer genetic tests NOT diagnostic**:

- 23andMe, AncestryDNA detect SOME mutations (not all)
- Not comprehensive
- Not diagnostic-grade

**If consumer test shows mutation**:

- ✅ Confirm with clinical AAT level + genotype test
- Don't rely on consumer test alone

---

### My test showed rare variant. What does that mean?

**Over 100 rare AATD mutations exist**:

- Most common: M, Z, S
- Rare: F, I, P, Null, and many others
- Risk varies depending on variant

**What to do**:

- Discuss with AATD specialist and/or genetic counselor
- Some rare variants cause disease, others don't
- Baseline testing and monitoring important

---

### I'm adopted. Should I still get tested?

**Yes, if you have risk factors**:

- Early-onset lung disease
- Unexplained liver disease
- Symptoms consistent with AATD

**You won't be able to test family members**, but:

- Important for YOUR health
- Can inform your children (if you have kids)

---

### Can testing affect my insurance?

**Genetic discrimination protections**:

- **GINA (Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act)**: Federal law prohibits health insurance and employment discrimination based on genetic information
- Applies to health insurance and employers with 15+ employees

**Not protected**:

- Life insurance
- Disability insurance
- Long-term care insurance

**Consider**: Get life/disability insurance BEFORE genetic testing (if concerned)

---

### What if my doctor won't order testing?

**Options**:

1. **Explain why you want it**: Reference ATS/ERS guidelines, explain risk factors
2. **Get second opinion**: See another doctor
3. **Order testing yourself**: AlphaID program (free), home testing kits
4. **Contact Mark Egly Foundation**: Patient navigators can help advocate

---

### How long should I wait between AAT level and genotype?

**Ideally same time**:

- Order both tests at once
- Only one blood draw needed

**If AAT level already done**:

- Don't delay genotype test
- Get it as soon as possible

---

### Can children be tested?

**Yes**:

- AATD can affect children (liver disease)
- Testing is safe at any age
- Blood test or cheek swab

**When to test children**:

- Symptoms (liver disease, lung issues)
- Parent or sibling has AATD
- Family planning (testing before having more kids)

**Genetic counseling recommended** before testing minors
