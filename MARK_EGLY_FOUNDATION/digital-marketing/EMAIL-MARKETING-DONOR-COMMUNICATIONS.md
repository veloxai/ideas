- **Header:** Logo, navigation (optional), social icons
- **Hero Image:** Relevant photo, 600x300px, alt text required
- **Body:** Clear hierarchy, scannable, white space
- **CTA Button:** High contrast, 44x44px minimum (mobile touch target)
- **Footer:** Address, unsubscribe, social links, contact info

**Branding:**

- **Colors:** Foundation brand colors, consistent across emails
- **Fonts:** Web-safe (Arial, Georgia) or web fonts (Google Fonts)
- **Logo:** High-res, properly sized, linked to website
- **Images:** Optimized (<200KB each), descriptive alt text

**Accessibility:**

- **Text Size:** 14-16px minimum body text
- **Contrast:** WCAG AA minimum (4.5:1 for text)
- **Alt Text:** All images described
- **Link Text:** Descriptive (not "click here")
- **Plain Text Version:** Always include for accessibility and spam filter

### 5.2 Subject Line Best Practices

**Length:**

- **Optimal:** 30-50 characters (mobile preview)
- **Maximum:** 60 characters before truncation

**Strategies:**

- **Personalization:** "Sarah, your Alpha-1 questions answered"
- **Urgency:** "Last chance - Gala tickets selling fast"
- **Curiosity:** "The #1 mistake after Alpha-1 diagnosis"
- **Benefit:** "Get your free Alpha-1 testing guide"
- **Emotion:** "This patient story will inspire you 💙"
- **Question:** "Have you been tested for Alpha-1?"

**Testing:**

- A/B test 2-3 variations per campaign
- Test one variable at a time (personalization, emoji, length, tone)
- Minimum 1,000 subscribers per test group for statistical significance

**Emojis:**

- Use sparingly (1-2 max, at start or end)
- Relevant to content (💙 heart, 🎉 celebration, 📅 event)
- Test - some audiences love, others ignore

### 5.3 Copywriting Formula

**AIDA Framework:**

**Attention (Subject Line + Preheader):**

- Grab attention immediately
- Promise value or create curiosity
- Example: "Sarah beat Alpha-1 - here's how" + Preheader: "Her story will give you hope"

**Interest (Opening Paragraph):**

- Hook reader with compelling statement or question
- Relate to their pain point or aspiration
- Example: "Imagine waiting 7 years for answers about your breathing problems..."

**Desire (Body Content):**

- Build emotional connection
- Show transformation or solution
- Use stories, data, testimonials
- Example: "Meet John, who went from struggling to breathe to running his first 5K after diagnosis and treatment."

**Action (Call-to-Action):**

- Clear, specific CTA
- Single primary action (don't overload options)
- Action-oriented language
- Example: "Get Your Free Testing Guide" (not "Learn More")

**Copywriting Tips:**

- **Short Paragraphs:** 2-3 sentences max
- **Bullet Points:** Break up text, improve scannability
- **Active Voice:** "We're changing lives" not "Lives are being changed"
- **Second Person:** "You" language, direct address
- **Storytelling:** People remember stories, not statistics
- **Urgency:** Deadlines, limited spots, matching gifts
- **Proof:** Testimonials, data, results

### 5.4 Call-to-Action (CTA) Best Practices

**Button Design:**

- **Size:** Large enough for mobile tap (44x44px minimum)
- **Color:** High contrast with background, brand-aligned
- **Text:** Action verb + benefit ("Donate Now," "Get Your Guide," "Register Today")
- **Placement:** Above the fold (first screen) + repeat at end

**CTA Hierarchy:**

- **Primary CTA:** Main action, most prominent (1 per email)
- **Secondary CTA:** Optional action, less prominent (1-2 per email)
- **Tertiary CTA:** Footer links (social, website, contact)

**Testing:**

- Test button color (brand color vs. contrasting)
- Test button text (verb-focused vs. benefit-focused)
- Test placement (early vs. late in email)

**Examples:**

**Strong CTAs:**

- ✅ "Donate Now - Double Your Impact"
- ✅ "Get Your Free Testing Guide"
- ✅ "Register for Our Walk"
- ✅ "Share Your Alpha-1 Story"

**Weak CTAs:**

- ❌ "Click Here"
- ❌ "Learn More"
- ❌ "Submit"
- ❌ "Read On"

- ESP provides DKIM keys to add to DNS
- Verifies email hasn't been tampered with

**DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication):**

- Policy telling receivers what to do with failed SPF/DKIM
- DNS TXT record: `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:postmaster@markegly.org`
- Monitors and protects domain reputation

**Implementation:**

- Work with ESP and web host/DNS provider
- Critical for deliverability (especially Gmail, Yahoo)
- Test with mail-tester.com after setup

### 6.2 Sender Reputation

**Warm Up Schedule (New Domain/ESP):**

- Week 1: Send to 100 most engaged subscribers
- Week 2: Send to 300 engaged subscribers
- Week 3: Send to 1,000 engaged subscribers
- Week 4: Send to 3,000+ (slowly increase)
- Avoid: Sending to full list immediately (spam flags)

**Reputation Factors:**

- **Open Rates:** Higher = better reputation
- **Spam Complaints:** Keep <0.1%
- **Bounce Rates:** Keep <2% (hard bounces)
- **Engagement:** Clicks, replies, forwards (positive signals)
- **Unsubscribe Rate:** Keep <2%

**Monitoring:**

- Google Postmaster Tools (Gmail delivery insights)
- Microsoft SNDS (Outlook/Hotmail delivery)
- ESP deliverability reports
- Regular inbox placement tests

### 6.3 List Hygiene

**Monthly:**

- Remove hard bounces immediately
- Flag soft bounces (retry, remove after 3 fails)
- Monitor spam complaints

**Quarterly:**

- Re-engagement campaign for inactive subscribers (90+ days no opens)
- Remove permanently inactive (180+ days, no re-engagement response)
- Verify email syntax and format

**Annually:**

- Full list scrubbing with validation service
- Remove role-based emails (info@, admin@) if low engagement
- Segment and archive long-term inactive

**Why It Matters:**

- Improves deliverability (fewer bad addresses)
- Reduces ESP costs (pay per subscriber)
- Better engagement metrics
- Protects sender reputation
