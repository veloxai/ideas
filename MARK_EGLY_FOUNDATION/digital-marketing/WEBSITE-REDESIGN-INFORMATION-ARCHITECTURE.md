**Document Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** November 10, 2025
**Owner:** Marketing & Communications Team
**Status:** Active

## Executive Summary

The Mark Egly Foundation's website is the primary digital touchpoint for patients, families, donors, researchers, and partners. A well-designed, accessible, and informative website is critical for fulfilling the Foundation's mission of reducing Alpha-1 diagnostic delays, supporting patients, and building community.

**Current State (Assumption):**

- Website may not exist yet, or exists as minimal placeholder
- Need comprehensive website serving multiple audiences with distinct needs
- Must balance patient education, fundraising, research program promotion, and community building

**Website Vision:**
A world-class digital platform that:

1. **Educates** patients and families about Alpha-1 (symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, living well)
2. **Accelerates Diagnosis** through provider education and testing awareness campaigns
3. **Connects** patients to assistance programs, support, and resources
4. **Engages** donors with compelling stories and transparent impact reporting
5. **Attracts** researchers to grant opportunities and collaborations
6. **Builds Community** through stories, events, and peer connections

**Domain Strategy:**

- **Primary Domain:** MarkEglyFoundation.org (or .com) - official Foundation website
- **Secondary Domain (Optional):** Alpha1Life.com - patient community/resource hub, more accessible branding for patients unfamiliar with Mark Egly
- **Decision Point:** Single comprehensive site vs. dual-site strategy (Foundation site + patient community site)

**Budget Range:**

- **Basic Website:** $15,000-$25,000 (template-based WordPress, essential features)
- **Mid-Range Website:** $30,000-$50,000 (custom design, advanced features, integrations)
- **Premium Website:** $60,000-$100,000+ (fully custom, sophisticated functionality, video production, accessibility optimization)
- **Recommended Year 1:** $30,000-$40,000 (mid-range, professional quality without overinvestment)

**Timeline:**

- **Discovery & Planning:** 4-6 weeks
- **Design:** 6-8 weeks
- **Development:** 8-12 weeks
- **Content Creation:** Concurrent with design/development (10-12 weeks)
- **Testing & Launch:** 2-4 weeks
- **Total:** 5-7 months from kickoff to launch

## Part 3: Design & User Experience

### Design Principles

1. **Clarity:** Information easy to find, understand, and act on
2. **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliant minimum (ideally AAA for patient-facing content)
3. **Credibility:** Professional, trustworthy design instilling confidence
4. **Compassion:** Warm, hopeful tone reflecting patient-centered mission
5. **Responsiveness:** Seamless experience across desktop, tablet, mobile
6. **Speed:** Fast load times (<3 seconds)

---

### Visual Design

**Brand Identity Elements:**

**Color Palette:**

- **Primary Color:** Teal/Turquoise (#00A6A6 or similar) - represents breath, hope, lungs, calming
- **Secondary Color:** Navy Blue (#003D5B) - trust, stability, professionalism
- **Accent Color:** Coral/Orange (#F2851F) - energy, warmth, call-to-action
- **Neutral Grays:** Light gray backgrounds (#F5F5F5), dark gray text (#333333)
- **Rationale:** Respiratory health foundations often use blues/teals (lung association with air/sky); coral provides warmth and differentiates from clinical feel

**Typography:**

- **Headings:** Sans-serif, bold, modern (e.g., Montserrat, Poppins, Open Sans Bold)
- **Body Text:** Highly readable sans-serif (e.g., Open Sans, Lato, Roboto) - better for web than serif
- **Size:** Minimum 16px body text (accessibility best practice), larger for patient-facing content (18px)
- **Line Height:** 1.5-1.6 (readability)
- **Contrast:** Minimum 4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text (WCAG AA)

**Imagery:**

- **Hero Images:** Large, inspiring photos of patients living full lives (hiking, with family, golfing with Mark Egly, smiling/hopeful not clinical/sad)
- **Patient Photos:** Diverse representation (age, race, gender, disease severity)
- **Mark Egly Presence:** Photos of Mark (PGA pro images, patient advocate images, personal story)
- **Iconography:** Consistent icon set for programs/services (e.g., heart for patient assistance, microscope for research, people for support groups)
- **Video:** Homepage hero video (2-3 min) featuring Mark's story + patient testimonials

**Layout Principles:**

- **White Space:** Generous margins and padding (reduces cognitive load, improves readability)
- **Grid System:** Consistent 12-column grid for alignment
- **Content Hierarchy:** Clear visual hierarchy (H1 > H2 > H3 sizing, bold for emphasis)
- **Chunking:** Break content into digestible sections with subheadings
- **F-Pattern/Z-Pattern:** Leverage natural reading patterns for layout

---

### Content Guidelines

**Writing Principles:**

1. **Plain Language:** 8th-grade reading level for patient content (use Hemingway Editor or Grammarly readability scores)
2. **Active Voice:** "We support patients" not "Patients are supported by us"
3. **Short Sentences:** 15-20 words per sentence average
4. **Short Paragraphs:** 3-4 sentences maximum
5. **Scannable:** Use subheadings, bullet points, bold for emphasis
6. **Actionable:** Every page should have clear next step (CTA)

**Tone & Voice:**

- **Tone:** Hopeful, compassionate, empowering, authoritative (without being clinical)
- **Voice:** Conversational but professional, warm but credible
- **Examples:**
  - ❌ Too Clinical: "Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency is an autosomal co-dominant genetic disorder characterized by decreased circulating levels of AAT glycoprotein."
  - ✅ Just Right: "Alpha-1 is a genetic condition you inherit from your parents. People with Alpha-1 have lower levels of a protective protein in their blood, which can lead to lung and liver problems over time."

**SEO Best Practices:**

- **Target Keywords:** "Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency," "AATD," "Alpha-1 diagnosis," "genetic testing Alpha-1," "Alpha-1 treatment," "Alpha-1 support," "Alpha-1 financial assistance"
- **Page Titles:** Unique, descriptive, include primary keyword (60 characters max)
- **Meta Descriptions:** Compelling, action-oriented, include keyword (155 characters max)
- **Headers:** Use H1 (once per page), H2, H3 hierarchy with keywords naturally incorporated
- **Image Alt Text:** Descriptive alt text for every image (accessibility + SEO)
- **Internal Linking:** Link related pages (helps SEO and user navigation)
- **Content Length:** Important pages 1,000-2,000 words (Google favors comprehensive content)

---

## Part 5: Technology & Platform

### CMS Platform Selection

**Option 1: WordPress (Recommended)**

- Excellent for nonprofits (many nonprofit-specific themes and plugins)
- Strong SEO capabilities (Yoast SEO plugin)
- Donation integrations (GiveWP, Charitable)
- Form builders (Gravity Forms, WPForms)

**Cons:**

- Low cost ($15-$45/month)
- Hosting included

**Cons:**

- Limited customization
- Less professional appearance
- Weak for complex forms (application forms)

## Part 6: Accessibility Compliance

### WCAG 2.1 Level AA Requirements

**Why Accessibility Matters:**

- **Legal:** Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) applies to websites; nonprofits have been sued for inaccessible sites
- **Mission Alignment:** Alpha-1 patients may have disabilities (COPD affects mobility, oxygen use); website must be accessible to those most needing help
- **Broader Reach:** 1 in 4 adults in US has disability; accessible design expands audience

**Key Accessibility Standards:**

**1. Perceivable:**

- **Text Alternatives:** Alt text for all images, icons, charts
- **Captions & Transcripts:** Captions for videos, transcripts for audio
- **Color Contrast:** Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (18pt+)
- **Resizable Text:** Users can increase text size to 200% without losing functionality

**2. Operable:**

- **Keyboard Navigation:** Entire site navigable via keyboard only (no mouse required)
- **Focus Indicators:** Visible focus outline when tabbing through elements
- **No Keyboard Traps:** Users can tab out of all elements
- **Skip Links:** "Skip to Main Content" link at top (bypasses navigation for screen readers)
- **Pause/Stop:** Ability to pause auto-playing videos, carousels

**3. Understandable:**

- **Plain Language:** Clear, simple writing (8th-grade reading level for patient content)
- **Predictable Navigation:** Consistent navigation across site
- **Error Prevention:** Forms provide helpful error messages ("Please enter valid email address")
- **Labels & Instructions:** Every form field has clear label and instruction

**4. Robust:**

- **Semantic HTML:** Proper use of H1, H2, H3 tags (screen readers rely on this)

## Part 10: Domain Strategy Revisited

### Single-Site vs. Multi-Site Decision

**Option A: Single Comprehensive Site (MarkEglyFoundation.org)**

**Pros:**

- Single brand to build (easier marketing)
- All content in one place (simpler for users)
- Lower maintenance (one site to update)
- Stronger SEO (all authority to one domain)

**Cons:**

- Harder to balance multiple audiences (patients, donors, researchers on one site)
- URL can be long (MarkEglyFoundation.org/programs-services/patient-assistance-program/how-to-apply)

**Recommended:** START with single site

---

**Option B: Dual-Site Strategy (MarkEglyFoundation.org + Alpha1Life.com)**

**MarkEglyFoundation.org (Institutional Site):**

- About Foundation (mission, leadership, financials)
- Donate / Get Involved
- Research Grants
- News / Press
- Contact

**Alpha1Life.com (Patient Community Site):**

- Alpha-1 Information (disease education)
- Patient Assistance Program
- Free Testing Program
- Support Groups / Community
- Patient Stories
- Living with Alpha-1 resources

**Pros:**

- Patient-friendly branding (patients may not know "Mark Egly Foundation" but will search "Alpha-1")
- Cleaner separation of institutional vs. patient content
- Shorter, more memorable patient URL

**Cons:**

- Confusing (two sites to explain)
- Higher maintenance (update two sites)
- Split SEO authority
- Higher cost (two sites to develop)

**Recommendation:** ONLY pursue dual-site strategy if:

- Single site becomes unwieldy (1,000+ pages, Years 3-5)
- Clear user confusion about Foundation vs. patient resources
- Budget allows ($15K-$25K additional for second site)

**Year 1: Build MarkEglyFoundation.org as comprehensive site**
**Year 2-3: Evaluate if dual-site strategy needed based on analytics and user feedback**
