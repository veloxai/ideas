## Crisis Management Philosophy

### Foundation's Crisis Response Principles

**Principle 1: Patient Safety First**
Any crisis response prioritizes patient well-being above organizational reputation or financial considerations.

**Principle 2: Transparency & Honesty**
Foundation communicates honestly about crisis scope, impact, and response—no cover-ups, no minimizing, no spin (except legally privileged).

**Principle 3: Rapid Response**
Act within 1-4 hours of crisis identification—silence fuels speculation, swift action demonstrates control.

**Principle 4: Unified Voice**
Only designated spokespersons communicate externally—prevents contradictory messages, rumors, unauthorized statements.

**Principle 5: Preserve Mission Continuity**
Crisis response protects Foundation's ability to serve AATD patients long-term—short-term pain acceptable if preserves mission.

---

### Crisis vs. Issue vs. Incident

**Crisis**: Event requiring immediate, coordinated response across organization—threatens reputation, operations, or financial viability
- Examples: Data breach exposing 5,000 patient records, Executive Director accused of fraud, major donor publicly withdraws support alleging mismanagement

**Issue**: Ongoing challenge requiring management attention but not immediate crisis response
- Examples: Staff turnover, budget deficit, declining donor retention

**Incident**: One-time problem handled through normal operations
- Examples: Support group leader sick (find substitute), website down 2 hours (IT fixes), grant application rejected (apply elsewhere)

**Decision Rule**: If you're asking "Is this a crisis?"—convene Crisis Management Team to decide. Better to mobilize unnecessarily than delay response to actual crisis.

- **Patient Harm**: Foundation's advice alleged to have harmed patient (e.g., delayed diagnosis due to bad referral)
- **Discrimination Claims**: Lawsuit alleging Foundation discriminated against employee or patient based on protected class
- **Controversial Statement**: Board member or staff makes offensive public statement, Foundation associated with backlash
- **Partnership Scandal**: Pharmaceutical partner accused of price gouging, Foundation criticized for accepting funding

**Impact**: Loss of donor trust, media scrutiny, Board resignations, patient community distrust

### CMT Activation Triggers

**Automatic CMT Activation** (No Discussion Required):
- Data breach affecting >100 patients
- Executive Director death, serious illness, or termination
- Media inquiry about scandal/controversy
- Lawsuit filed against Foundation or Board members
- Natural disaster forcing office closure >3 days
- Cyber attack shutting down systems >24 hours

## Crisis Response Protocols

### Phase 1: Crisis Identification & Activation (Hour 0-1)

**Step 1: Crisis Identified** (Any staff member can identify potential crisis)

**How Crises Are Discovered**:
- Staff observes incident (data breach alert, patient complaint, media inquiry)
- External party notifies Foundation (attorney, insurance carrier, media, donor)
- Monitoring systems detect (cybersecurity alerts, social media monitoring)
- Whistleblower report (internal hotline, Board member notification)

**Immediate Action**: Staff member notifies CMT Leader (Executive Director) within 15 minutes via:
- Phone call (preferred—fastest)
- Text message (if ED unreachable by phone)
- Email marked "URGENT: POTENTIAL CRISIS"

---

**Step 2: CMT Leader Assessment** (15-30 minutes)

**CMT Leader Determines**:
- Is this a crisis, issue, or incident? (Use definitions above)
- What severity level? (1, 2, or 3)
- Who needs to be involved? (Core CMT + extended members)

**If Crisis**: Activate CMT (send alert to all CMT members)

**CMT Activation Message Template**:
> **SUBJECT: CMT ACTIVATION - [Crisis Type] - [Date/Time]**
>
> Crisis Management Team is activated as of [TIME].
>
> **Crisis**: [1-sentence description]
> **Severity**: Level [1/2/3]
> **First Meeting**: [Location/Zoom link], [Date/Time - within 1-4 hours]

**For Staff Misconduct**:
- Place employee on administrative leave (paid, pending investigation)
- Secure employee's access (disable systems, retrieve keys/badges)
- Preserve evidence (emails, documents, witness statements)

**For Financial Crises**:
- Freeze non-essential spending

---

### Media Response Procedures

**Designated Spokespersons** (ONLY these people speak to media):

**Primary Spokesperson**:
- **Executive Director**: For general organizational crises, mission-related topics
- **Board Chair**: For governance crises (ED misconduct, Board matters)

**Backup Spokesperson**:
- **Communications Director**: If ED/Board Chair unavailable, handles media operationally

**Subject Matter Experts** (only with ED approval):
- **Medical Director**: For clinical/patient safety questions
- **Research Director**: For research-related crises
- **Legal Counsel**: For legal questions (rare—usually "no comment on pending litigation")

**Absolutely NO Media Contact**:
- Staff members (except as authorized above)
- Board members (except Chair or as authorized)
- Volunteers
- Patients (unless Foundation coordinates their participation as spokesperson)

---

**Media Inquiry Response Protocol**:

**Step 1: Log Inquiry** (Media Inquiry Log—Google Sheet or CRM)
- Reporter name
- Media outlet
- Phone/email
- Questions asked (verbatim)
- Deadline
- Tone (neutral, hostile, sympathetic)

**Step 2: Acknowledge & Buy Time**
> "Thank you for reaching out. We are gathering information and will provide a statement by [TIME, typically 2-4 hours]."

**Step 3: CMT Approves Response**
- Communications Lead drafts response
- Legal Counsel reviews (ensure no admissions, defamation, false statements)
- CMT Leader approves
- Communications Lead delivers response to reporter

**Step 4: Provide Statement**
- Phone call (if building relationship with reporter)
- Email (creates record, prevents misquotes)
- On-camera interview (only if CMT agrees, spokesperson trained)

---

**Media Interview Dos & Don'ts**:

**DO**:
- ✅ Stick to approved talking points (3-5 key messages)
- ✅ Bridge back to key messages ("What's important to understand is...")
- ✅ Express empathy ("We understand this is concerning to patients")
- ✅ Explain what Foundation is doing (action-oriented)
- ✅ Correct factual errors ("Actually, that's not accurate—here's the fact...")

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Say "No comment" (implies guilt—instead say "I can't comment on pending litigation, but I can tell you...")
- ❌ Speculate ("I don't know" is okay; "I think maybe..." is not)
- ❌ Get defensive or argue with reporter
- ❌ Assume anything is "off the record" (treat all statements as on-record)
- ❌ Fill silence (reporter pauses hoping you'll say more—stick to message, stop talking)

---

## Social Media Management During Crises

### Social Media Lockdown Protocol

**When to Lock Down Social Media** (prevent rogue posts, uncoordinated messaging):

**Level 2-3 Crises Involving**:
- Allegations of misconduct
- Patient harm
- Data breaches
- Legal matters
- Controversial topics

**Lockdown Steps** (within 30 minutes of crisis identification):
1. **Pause all scheduled posts** (cancel queued content—may seem tone-deaf during crisis)
2. **Restrict posting permissions** (only Communications Lead can post)
3. **Turn off auto-replies** (chatbots may give wrong information)
4. **Monitor continuously** (every 30-60 minutes) for:
   - Mentions of Foundation
   - Patient/donor comments
   - Media/influencer posts
   - Misinformation spread

---

### Social Media Response Guidelines

**Responding to Comments/Posts About Crisis**:

**DO Respond If**:
- Factual misinformation (correct politely)
- Direct questions (answer or direct to official statement)
- Supportive comments (thank them)

**DON'T Respond If**:
- Trolling/inflammatory (don't feed trolls)
- Profanity/abusive (hide comment, block if necessary)
- Legal accusations (don't engage—refer to attorney)

**Response Template**:
> Thank you for your concern. We take this matter very seriously. [Link to official statement]. If you have specific questions, please contact us at [email].

---

**Monitoring Tools** (during crisis, monitor every 30-60 minutes):
- Google Alerts (Foundation name + crisis keywords)
- Social media mentions (Hootsuite, Sprout Social, or native platform searches)
- News aggregators (Google News, Feedly)

**Crisis Escalation Trigger**: If negative sentiment spikes (100+ negative comments/posts in 24 hours), escalate to CMT—may need additional public response.

## Stakeholder Notification Sequences

### Data Breach Notification Example

**Scenario**: Hacker accesses patient registry, 2,000 patient records (name, DOB, email, diagnosis, genetic data) exposed.

**Notification Timeline** (HIPAA requires notification without unreasonable delay, no later than 60 days):

| **Timeframe**     | **Stakeholder**              | **Method**          | **Content**                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hour 0-1**      | Insurance carrier (Cyber)    | Phone call          | Activate cyber liability policy, forensics vendor engaged                   |

### Executive Director Termination Example

**Scenario**: Board fires ED for financial misconduct (misuse of Foundation credit card).

**Notification Timeline**:

| **Timeframe**     | **Stakeholder**              | **Method**          | **Content**                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hour 0**        | Executive Director           | In-person meeting   | Termination notification, severance terms (if any), exit logistics          |
| **Hour 0-1**      | Senior staff (COO, Directors)| In-person meeting   | ED terminated, Board Chair explains, Acting ED designated                   |
| **Hour 1-2**      | All staff                    | All-staff meeting   | "ED has left the organization, [Acting ED] will lead during transition"     |
| **Hour 2-4**      | Full Board                   | Email + call        | Board Chair briefs on decision, rationale, next steps                       |
| **Day 1**         | Major donors ($25K+/year)    | Phone calls         | "Change in leadership, Board confident in mission continuity"               |
| **Day 1-2**       | Key partners                 | Email               | Leadership transition notice, reassure partnerships continue                |
| **Day 2-3**       | All donors                   | Email               | "Leadership transition, Board is conducting search, Acting ED introduced"   |
| **Day 3-7**       | Public (if leaked to media)  | Press release       | "ED resigned/departed, Board appreciates contributions, search underway"    |

**Note**: Typically do NOT disclose "fired for cause" publicly (employment law risk—defamation, wrongful term claims). Public statement: "Departed to pursue other opportunities" (unless criminal charges filed—then can acknowledge).

## Recovery & Business Continuity

### Business Continuity During Crisis

**Essential Functions to Maintain** (even during crisis):
1. **Patient Support Services**: Support groups, patient navigation, hotline (mission-critical)
2. **Payroll**: Staff must be paid (legal + morale)
3. **Donor Communications**: Thank yous, receipts (IRS requirement, donor relations)
4. **Grant Reporting**: Deadlines must be met (or funder informed of delay)

**Non-Essential Functions to Pause** (if capacity strained):
- New program launches
- Non-urgent hiring
- Conference planning (if >3 months out)
- Website redesigns, non-crisis marketing

---

### Restoring Stakeholder Trust

**Trust Rebuilding Strategies** (post-crisis):

**Transparency Reports**:
- Publish post-crisis report (what happened, what Foundation learned, what changed)
- Annual update on corrective measures

**Donor Engagement**:
- Host donor town halls (virtual or in-person)—allow questions, listen to concerns
- Increase donor reporting (show how funds are used responsibly)

**Patient Reassurance**:
- Patient conference address (ED or Board Chair speaks transparently about crisis, lessons learned)
- Strengthen patient advisory board (show patient voice is heard)

**Media Rebuild**:
- Positive story placements (patient success stories, research breakthroughs)—shift narrative from crisis to impact

**Board Oversight**:
- Implement new oversight mechanisms (quarterly Board audits, whistleblower hotline)
- Replace Board members if necessary (if Board culpability)

---

## Post-Crisis Evaluation

### Post-Crisis Debrief (Within 7 Days of Resolution)

**CMT Post-Mortem Meeting** (2 hours, facilitated by external consultant if major crisis):

**Agenda**:
1. **Crisis Timeline Review** (30 min): Reconstruct timeline—when did crisis start, when identified, when resolved
2. **What Went Well** (30 min): Effective responses, good decisions, teamwork wins
3. **What Went Poorly** (30 min): Mistakes, delays, missed opportunities, communication breakdowns
4. **Root Cause Analysis** (30 min): Why did crisis happen? Could it have been prevented?
5. **Action Items** (30 min): Policy changes, training needs, system upgrades, staffing changes

**Output**: Crisis Summary Report (10-15 pages) documenting:
- Timeline
- Financial cost
- Reputational impact
- Lessons learned
- Recommendations
- Updated Crisis Management Plan sections

---

### Crisis Summary Report to Board

**Report Sections**:

**1. Executive Summary** (1 page)

## Crisis Simulation Exercises

### Annual Crisis Drill (Tabletop Exercise)

**Purpose**: Test Crisis Management Plan, train CMT, identify gaps

**Frequency**: Annually (more frequently if high-risk environment or recent crisis)

**Format**: 2-hour tabletop exercise (CMT + Board Chair participate)

**Facilitator**: External consultant or experienced crisis management professional (brings objectivity)

---

**Tabletop Exercise Agenda**:

**Phase 1: Scenario Introduction** (15 min)
- Facilitator presents fictional crisis (realistic, relevant to Foundation)
- Example: "It's 9am Monday. Your IT Director alerts you that the patient registry was hacked over the weekend. 5,000 patient records may have been accessed. A reporter from the New York Times just called asking for comment—she already knows about the breach and is writing a story."

**Phase 2: Initial Response** (30 min)
- CMT discusses: What do we do first? Who do we notify? What do we say?
- Facilitator injects new information every 10 minutes ("Board Chair's daughter is one of the affected patients and she's tweeting angrily about it")

**Phase 3: Communication Exercise** (30 min)
- CMT drafts holding statement
- Designate spokesperson, practice delivering message
- Facilitator plays reporter, asks tough questions

**Phase 4: Decision Dilemmas** (30 min)
- Facilitator presents tough choices: "Pay $100K ransom to prevent hackers from releasing data? Or refuse and let them post it online?"
- CMT debates, makes decision

**Phase 5: Debrief** (15 min)
- What went well? What gaps identified?
- Update Crisis Management Plan based on learnings

---

**Example Scenarios for Tabletop Drills**:
1. **Data Breach** (most likely crisis for patient registry)
2. **Executive Director Sudden Death** (tests succession plan)
3. **Major Donor Scandal** (largest donor indicted for fraud, media asks if Foundation will return donations)
4. **Patient Harm** (patient claims Foundation's advice led to delayed diagnosis, now has end-stage lung disease)
5. **Embezzlement** (staff member stole $100K, discovered during audit)
6. **Ransomware** (systems locked, attackers demand payment)

---

---

**Crisis Response Budget** (reactive—when crisis occurs):

| **Crisis Type**            | **Typical Cost Range** | **Cost Drivers**                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Breach (Small)**    | $50,000-$150,000       | Forensics, notification, credit monitoring, legal                     |
| **Data Breach (Large)**    | $250,000-$1,000,000+   | Above + regulatory fines, class action defense                        |

**Insurance Coverage**: Most crisis costs covered by insurance (D&O, Cyber, EPLI, Business Interruption)—but deductibles ($5K-$25K) and uncovered costs still significant.

**Emergency Reserve**: Foundation should maintain 3-6 months operating expenses in reserve—doubles as crisis fund.
