## Insurance Philosophy & Risk Strategy

### Foundation's Insurance Approach

**Mission Protection First**: Insurance exists to protect the Foundation's ability to serve AATD patients—not just assets, but continuity of operations, reputation, and trust.

**Three-Layer Defense**:
1. **Risk Avoidance**: Don't do activities that create uninsurable risk (no direct medical care, no overseas travel to high-risk countries)
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Implement strong policies, training, and controls to reduce likelihood/severity
3. **Risk Transfer**: Purchase insurance to transfer remaining risk to carriers

**Cost-Benefit Balance**:
- Self-insure small risks (<$5K)—not worth claims hassle
- Insure medium risks ($5K-$50K)—significant but manageable
- Heavily insure catastrophic risks (>$50K)—could destroy Foundation

---

### Insurance Coverage Roadmap by Growth Stage

**Year 1 (Startup—5-10 employees, $500K budget)**:
- General Liability: $1M/$2M aggregate
- D&O: $1M limit
- Cyber Liability: $1M limit (CRITICAL—patient data)

- Cyber Liability: $2M limit
- EPLI: $1M limit (now have enough employees to justify)
- Professional Liability: $1M/$3M (if providing patient navigation)
- Umbrella: $5M excess
- **Total Premium**: $25,000-$35,000/year

**Year 4-5 (Mature—20-30 employees, $5M-$10M budget)**:
- General Liability: $3M/$6M aggregate
- D&O: $5M limit (higher asset base, Board exposure)
- Cyber Liability: $5M limit (10K+ patient records)
- EPLI: $2M limit
- Professional Liability: $2M/$5M

---

## General Liability Insurance

### Coverage Purpose

**What It Covers**: Third-party bodily injury, property damage, personal injury (libel/slander), advertising injury arising from Foundation operations.

**Why Critical**: Protects against lawsuits from:
- Event attendee slips and falls at conference
- Visitor injured at Foundation office
- Property damage at rented venue
- Defamation claims from public statements

---

### Coverage Specifications

**Year 1 Minimum Coverage**:
- **Per Occurrence Limit**: $1,000,000
- **Annual Aggregate**: $2,000,000
- **Products/Completed Ops Aggregate**: $2,000,000
- **Personal & Advertising Injury**: $1,000,000
- **Medical Expense (no fault)**: $10,000 per person

**Deductible**: $0 (most GL policies are no-deductible)

**Premium**: $1,200-$2,500/year (Year 1, low revenue)

---

### Additional Insured Requirements

**When Required**: Venues, landlords, event sites often require Foundation to name them as "Additional Insured"

**Process**:
1. Request Additional Insured endorsement from broker (usually free or $25-$50)
2. Specify entity name and address exactly as requested
3. Provide Certificate of Insurance (COI) to venue
4. Keep copy of endorsement in insurance file

**Standard Additional Insureds**:
- Office landlord (lease requirement)
- Event venues (convention center, hotel ballroom)
- Co-sponsoring organizations (for joint events)

---

### Exclusions to Understand

**NOT Covered by General Liability**:
- Professional services (need Professional Liability/E&O)
- Employment practices (need EPLI)
- Cyber incidents (need Cyber Liability)
- Intentional acts by Foundation
- Pollution/environmental damage
- Auto liability (need Commercial Auto if Foundation owns vehicles)

---

## Directors & Officers (D&O) Insurance

### Coverage Purpose

**What It Covers**: Legal defense and damages when Board members or officers are sued for alleged wrongful acts in their governance role.

**Why Critical for Nonprofits**:
- Board members are volunteers—need protection or won't serve
- Lawsuits can target personal assets of Directors
- Even frivolous claims cost $50K-$200K to defend
- Required by many sophisticated Board candidates

---

### Coverage Specifications

**Year 1 Coverage**:
- **Policy Limit**: $1,000,000 (minimum acceptable)
- **Retention (Deductible)**: $5,000-$25,000 (Foundation pays this first)
- **Defense Costs**: Covered within policy limit (not "in addition to")
- **Prior Acts Date**: "Inception" (covers acts from Foundation founding)

**Premium**: $3,000-$6,000/year (Year 1)

**Coverage Increases**:
- Year 3: $2M limit (as assets grow)
- Year 5: $5M limit (once managing $10M+ endowment, large registry)

---

### Who Is Covered

**Insured Persons**:
- Board of Directors (all voting members)
- Officers (Executive Director, Treasurer, Secretary)
- Committee members acting in governance capacity
- Former Directors/Officers (for acts during tenure)
- Estates of deceased Directors/Officers

**Entity Coverage**: Some D&O policies include "Entity Coverage" (Side C)—reimburses Foundation when it indemnifies Directors

---

### Common D&O Claims for Nonprofits

**Real-World Scenarios**:
1. **Employment Practices**: Wrongful termination, discrimination (if EPLI not purchased or claim outside EPLI scope)
2. **Grant Mismanagement**: Donor sues claiming grant funds misused
3. **Regulatory Violations**: IRS, state Attorney General alleges breach of fiduciary duty
4. **Conflicts of Interest**: Board member alleged to have self-dealt
5. **Data Breach**: Board sued for failing to implement adequate data security (if Cyber policy excludes Board claims)
6. **Vendor Disputes**: Contractor claims Board wrongfully terminated contract
7. **Bankruptcy**: If Foundation becomes insolvent, creditors sue Board

---

### D&O Policy Negotiation Tips

**Critical Policy Features**:
- ✅ **Severability of Insureds**: One Director's fraud doesn't void coverage for innocent Directors
- ✅ **Advancement of Defense Costs**: Carrier pays defense costs as incurred (not just after settlement)
- ✅ **Broad Definition of Wrongful Act**: Includes "alleged" wrongful act (don't have to prove actual wrongdoing to get coverage)
- ✅ **Automatic Extension of Prior Acts**: If you switch carriers, new policy covers old acts
- ✅ **Non-Rescindable Policy**: Carrier can't cancel due to misrepresentation on application

**Avoid**:
- ❌ Policies with "Hammer Clauses" (carrier can force settlement, or insured pays difference)
- ❌ Policies requiring Board pay deductible personally (defeats purpose—should be Foundation paying retention)

---

## Professional Liability (Errors & Omissions)

### Coverage Purpose

**What It Covers**: Liability arising from professional services provided by Foundation—negligent advice, errors, omissions causing financial harm to patients/clients.

**When Foundation Needs This**:
- Patient navigation program (advising on treatment, insurance)
- Genetic counseling (not provided by Foundation, but referrals could be alleged negligent)
- Research services (if Foundation conducts studies, analyzes data)
- Educational programs (if CME courses provide medical advice)

---

### Coverage Specifications

**Year 2+ Coverage** (once patient services expand):
- **Per Claim Limit**: $1,000,000
- **Annual Aggregate**: $3,000,000
- **Deductible**: $10,000-$25,000 per claim
- **Coverage Trigger**: "Claims-Made" (claim must be made during policy period)
- **Retroactive Date**: Date patient services started (e.g., "January 1, 2026")

**Premium**: $4,000-$8,000/year (depends on services scope)

---

### Services Covered vs. Excluded

**Covered Professional Services**:
- ✅ Patient navigation and guidance
- ✅ Insurance appeals assistance (non-legal advice)
- ✅ Educational materials and resources
- ✅ Research coordination and data management
- ✅ Referrals to specialists
- ✅ Support group facilitation

**Excluded (Need Other Coverage or Not Insurable)**:
- ❌ Direct medical care (Foundation doesn't provide—would need Medical Malpractice)
- ❌ Legal advice (would need Lawyers Professional Liability—don't provide legal advice, refer to attorneys)
- ❌ Accounting/tax advice (refer to CPAs)

---

### Claims Scenarios for Patient Advocacy Nonprofits

**Example Claims**:
1. **Misadvised Treatment**: Patient claims navigator recommended stopping augmentation therapy, patient's condition worsened
2. **Insurance Appeal Failed**: Patient claims Foundation's appeal assistance was negligent, patient lost coverage
3. **Genetic Counseling**: Patient claims referral to genetic counselor led to incorrect family planning advice
4. **Research Harm**: Registry participant claims Foundation failed to protect privacy, suffered discrimination
5. **Educational Material**: Patient claims AATD guide contained inaccurate medical information, patient delayed treatment

**Defense**: Foundation must show:
- Services provided with reasonable care
- Disclaimers clearly stated (not medical advice)
- Licensed professionals consulted when appropriate
- Patient signed informed consent/waiver

---

## Cyber Liability Insurance

### Coverage Purpose

**What It Covers**: First-party costs and third-party liability from cyber incidents—data breaches, ransomware, system outages, privacy violations.

**Why CRITICAL for Mark Egly Foundation**:
- **Patient Registry**: 10,000+ patients with PHI (HIPAA-protected)
- **Research Data**: Genetic data, biospecimens linked to identities
- **Donor Database**: Credit card info, SSNs (for tax receipts)
- **HIPAA Penalties**: Up to $50,000 per violation, $1.5M per year
- **Reputational Harm**: Data breach could destroy patient trust permanently

---

### Coverage Specifications

**Year 1 Coverage** (MUST HAVE from Day 1):
- **Policy Limit**: $1,000,000 (minimum)
- **First-Party Coverage**: $500K (forensics, notification, credit monitoring, PR crisis)
- **Third-Party Coverage**: $500K (lawsuits, regulatory fines)
- **Business Interruption**: 30 days income loss
- **Deductible**: $5,000-$10,000

**Premium**: $4,000-$8,000/year (Year 1, small data set)

**Year 3+ Coverage** (once registry has 3,000+ patients):
- **Policy Limit**: $5,000,000
- **First-Party**: $2M
- **Third-Party**: $3M
- **Business Interruption**: 90 days
- **Ransom Reimbursement**: Up to $250K (if Foundation pays ransomware)

**Premium**: $12,000-$20,000/year

---

### First-Party Coverage Components

**Incident Response Costs** (Foundation pays these directly, insurance reimburses):
1. **Forensic Investigation**: Cybersecurity firm determines breach scope, root cause ($20K-$100K)
2. **Legal Counsel**: Privacy attorney advises on HIPAA notification obligations ($10K-$50K)
3. **Notification Costs**: Mail letters to all affected patients (50¢-$2 per letter × patients affected)
4. **Credit Monitoring**: 1-2 years free monitoring for affected patients ($15-$25/person/year)
5. **Call Center**: Hotline for patients to ask questions (4-8 weeks, $5K-$20K)
6. **Public Relations**: Crisis PR firm to manage media, restore reputation ($10K-$50K)
7. **System Restoration**: Rebuild IT systems, recover data from backups ($10K-$200K)

**Total Costs for 1,000-Patient Breach**: $100K-$500K (insurance covers after deductible)

---

### Third-Party Liability Coverage

**Lawsuits from**:
- **Patients**: "Foundation failed to protect my data, I suffered identity theft"
- **Regulatory Fines**: HHS Office for Civil Rights HIPAA penalties
- **State Attorneys General**: State privacy law violations (CCPA in California, etc.)
- **Payment Card Industry (PCI)**: If donor credit card data breached, fines from card networks

**Defense Costs**: $50K-$500K even if Foundation wins lawsuit

---

### Policy Requirements & Underwriting

**Insurance Carrier Will Require**:
1. **Security Assessment Questionnaire**: 50-100 questions about IT security practices
2. **Encryption**: All PHI encrypted at rest and in transit (AES-256)
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all systems with PHI
4. **Access Controls**: Role-based access, least privilege
5. **Backup & Recovery**: Daily backups, tested quarterly
6. **Incident Response Plan**: Written plan, tested annually
7. **Security Training**: All staff trained on phishing, data handling
8. **Vendor Management**: Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with all vendors handling PHI

**If Foundation Lacks These**: Carrier may decline coverage, charge 50-100% higher premium, or exclude certain coverages

---

### Ransomware Coverage Nuances

**Scenario**: Foundation's systems locked by ransomware, attackers demand $100K in Bitcoin to unlock.

**Coverage Decision Tree**:
1. **Pay Ransom?** Cyber policy reimburses ransom payment (up to sublimit, e.g., $250K)
2. **Ethical Dilemma**: Paying ransomware funds criminal organizations—Board decision
3. **Law Enforcement**: FBI recommends not paying, but understands business necessity
4. **Restoration**: If Foundation restores from backups, insurance covers restoration costs instead

**Best Practice**: Negotiate with carrier for ransom coverage, but invest in backups so never need to pay.

---

## Employment Practices Liability (EPLI)

### Coverage Purpose

**What It Covers**: Lawsuits by employees alleging wrongful employment practices—discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, retaliation, failure to promote.

**Why Needed**:
- Even small nonprofits face employment lawsuits (1 in 5 employers sued each year)
- Defense costs average $75K-$150K even if Foundation wins
- Settlements average $40K-$250K
- Board members personally named in some employment suits (D&O may not cover if EPLI exclusion)

---

### Coverage Specifications

**Year 2+ Coverage** (once 10+ employees):
- **Policy Limit**: $1,000,000
- **Deductible**: $10,000-$25,000 per claim
- **Defense Costs**: Included in limit (not "in addition to")
- **Coverage Trigger**: Claims-made (claim must be filed during policy period)

**Premium**: $2,000-$5,000/year (10-15 employees)

**Year 5 Coverage** (20-30 employees):
- **Policy Limit**: $2,000,000
- **Deductible**: $25,000

**Premium**: $5,000-$10,000/year

---

### Common EPLI Claims for Nonprofits

**Real-World Scenarios**:
1. **Wrongful Termination**: "I was fired for reporting financial mismanagement (retaliation)"
2. **Discrimination**: "I wasn't promoted because of my age/race/gender"
3. **Harassment**: "My supervisor created hostile work environment, Foundation did nothing"
4. **Wage & Hour**: "Foundation didn't pay overtime, misclassified me as exempt"
5. **Failure to Accommodate**: "I requested ADA accommodation for disability, Foundation denied"
6. **Retaliation**: "I filed workers' comp claim, then was terminated in retaliation"

**Average Defense Cost**: $75,000-$125,000 (even if Foundation prevails)
**Average Settlement**: $40,000-$80,000 (if case settles before trial)
**Trial Verdict**: $150,000-$500,000+ (if jury finds for plaintiff)

---

### EPLI vs. D&O Coverage

**Overlapping Coverage**:
- EPLI: Covers Foundation entity + managers/supervisors
- D&O: Covers Board members + officers

**Best Practice**: Purchase both
- EPLI as primary for employment claims
- D&O as backup if EPLI denies claim or exhausts limits

**Some D&O Policies Exclude Employment Practices**: If so, EPLI is CRITICAL (no coverage otherwise)

---

### Risk Management to Reduce EPLI Claims

**Prevention Strategies** (lowers premium, reduces claims):
1. **Written Policies**: Employee Handbook with clear anti-discrimination, anti-harassment, termination procedures
2. **Training**: Annual harassment prevention training (required in CA, NY, many states)
3. **Documentation**: Performance reviews, disciplinary warnings, termination justifications—written contemporaneously
4. **Complaint Procedures**: Clear process for employees to report harassment/discrimination, investigation protocol
5. **Legal Review**: Employment attorney reviews all terminations of protected class members, high-risk situations
6. **Exit Interviews**: Neutral third party conducts, identifies potential claims early

**Underwriting Factors** (insurance company asks):
- How many employees?
- Any claims in past 5 years?
- Do you have Employee Handbook?
- Do you conduct harassment training?
- Do you use employment attorney for terminations?

**Strong HR practices = 20-30% lower EPLI premium**

---

## Commercial Umbrella Policy

### Coverage Purpose

**What It Covers**: Excess liability coverage that sits "above" primary policies (GL, Auto, EPLI)—provides additional limits if primary policy exhausts.

**Example**: Foundation has $1M General Liability policy. Event attendee severely injured, jury awards $3M. Umbrella pays $2M excess.

---

### Coverage Specifications

**Year 3+ Coverage** (once assets justify):
- **Umbrella Limit**: $5,000,000 excess over primary
- **Self-Insured Retention (SIR)**: $10,000 (applies only if umbrella drops down because no primary coverage)
- **Underlying Policies Required**:
  - General Liability: $1M/$2M minimum
  - Auto Liability: $1M (if Foundation owns vehicles)
  - EPLI: $1M (if purchased)

**Premium**: $1,500-$3,000/year for $5M umbrella

**Year 5+**:
- **Umbrella Limit**: $10,000,000
- **Premium**: $2,500-$5,000/year

---

### When Umbrella Pays

**Scenario 1: Primary Policy Exhausts**
- General Liability claim: $2M judgment
- GL policy pays: $1M (policy limit)
- Umbrella pays: $1M (excess)
- Foundation pays: $0 (fully covered)

**Scenario 2: Drop-Down Coverage**
- Event attendee files claim not covered by primary GL (excluded peril)
- Umbrella "drops down" to provide coverage
- Foundation pays: $10K SIR (self-insured retention)
- Umbrella pays: Remainder up to $5M

---

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Without Umbrella**:
- Large judgment could bankrupt Foundation
- Board personally liable if judgment exceeds D&O limits
- Donors lose confidence if Foundation unprotected

**With $5M Umbrella** ($2,000/year premium):
- Protected against catastrophic claims
- Board/donors reassured
- Cost: $2,000/year ÷ $5M protection = 0.04% cost for protection

**Decision Rule**: Purchase Umbrella once Foundation's net assets exceed $1M (Year 3+)

---

## Workers' Compensation Insurance

### Coverage Purpose

**What It Covers**: Medical expenses and lost wages for employees injured or becoming ill due to work-related causes.

**Legal Requirement**: **MANDATORY in all 50 states** (except Texas—optional but strongly recommended)

**Why Critical**:
- Protects employees injured on the job
- Protects Foundation from lawsuits (Workers' Comp is "exclusive remedy"—employee can't sue)
- Violation penalties: Fines of $1,000-$100,000, criminal charges, personal liability for Board

---

### Coverage Specifications

**All States, All Employees**:
- **Coverage**: Statutory limits (set by state law—unlimited medical, % of wages for disability)
- **No Deductible**: Most states prohibit deductibles
- **Premium Basis**: Payroll × rate per $100 of payroll (rates vary by state, job classification)

**Example Premium Calculation**:
- Ohio Foundation, 10 employees, $500K total payroll
- Office workers (low risk): $0.20 per $100 payroll
- Premium: $500,000 ÷ 100 × $0.20 = **$1,000/year**

**Higher Risk Classifications** (if Foundation had these roles):
- Event setup workers: $2-$5 per $100
- Drivers: $3-$8 per $100
- Healthcare workers: $1-$3 per $100

---

### Multi-State Operations

**Challenge**: Foundation has employees in multiple states (remote workers, regional offices)

**Solution 1: Single-State Policy with Other States Endorsement**
- Purchase policy in Foundation's home state (Ohio)
- Add "Other States Endorsement" covering all states where employees work
- **Pro**: One policy, one renewal, simpler
- **Con**: May not be cheapest premium

**Solution 2: Separate Policy Per State**
- Purchase separate Workers' Comp policy in each state
- **Pro**: Meets state-specific requirements precisely
- **Con**: 5 states = 5 policies, 5 renewals, complex

**Recommendation**: Single-state policy with Other States Endorsement (Year 1-3), separate policies if >10 employees per state (Year 4+)

---

### Claims Management

**Employee Injured—Foundation's Steps**:
1. **Immediate Medical Care**: Send employee to ER or urgent care (Foundation pays, insurance reimburses)
2. **Notify Insurance Carrier**: Within 24 hours (online portal, phone, email)
3. **File State Workers' Comp Report**: Most states require within 7 days
4. **Cooperate with Claims Adjuster**: Provide payroll records, incident details
5. **Return-to-Work Program**: Modified duty if employee can work with restrictions

**Common Workers' Comp Claims for Nonprofits**:
- Slip/fall in office
- Carpal tunnel syndrome (repetitive computer work)
- Lifting injury (moving event supplies)
- Car accident (if employee driving on Foundation business)
- Stress/mental health claims (some states cover, most don't)

**Average Claim Cost**: $10,000-$40,000 (medical + lost wages)

---

### Experience Modification Rate (EMR)

**How Workers' Comp Pricing Works**:
- **Base Rate**: Set by state for job classification
- **Experience Mod (EMR)**: Multiplier based on Foundation's claims history
  - 1.0 = Average (no claims history)
  - 0.85 = 15% discount (excellent safety record)
  - 1.25 = 25% surcharge (multiple claims)

**Example**:
- Base premium: $5,000/year
- EMR 0.90 (good safety): $5,000 × 0.90 = $4,500 actual premium
- EMR 1.20 (multiple claims): $5,000 × 1.20 = $6,000 actual premium

**How to Lower EMR**:
- No claims for 3 years → EMR drops
- Implement safety programs
- Return-to-work programs (reduces lost wage costs)
- Contest fraudulent claims

---

## Property & Equipment Insurance

### Coverage Purpose

**What It Covers**: Physical assets owned or leased by Foundation—office contents, computers, furniture, equipment, tenant improvements.

**When Needed**:
- Office space (covers contents, not building—landlord covers building)
- Owned equipment >$10K total value
- Tenant improvements (if Foundation paid for office buildout)

---

### Coverage Specifications

**Year 1 (Home Office/Small Rented Office)**:
- Coverage may not be needed if equipment <$10K (self-insure)
- Or add to renters insurance/business owners policy (BOP)

**Year 2+ (Dedicated Office, $50K Equipment)**:
- **Property Limit**: $50,000 (replacement cost of contents)
- **Deductible**: $1,000-$2,500
- **Perils Covered**: Fire, theft, vandalism, water damage, wind
- **Business Interruption**: 30 days income loss if office unusable
- **Premium**: $500-$1,500/year

**Special Items to Schedule** (higher limits):
- Servers/IT equipment: $20K limit
- Biobank freezers (if stored at Foundation office): $50K per unit
- Specialized equipment (genetic testing devices): Actual cash value

---

### Business Owners Policy (BOP)

**What Is BOP**: Package policy bundling General Liability + Property + Business Interruption

**Advantages**:
- Cheaper than buying separately (10-20% discount)
- Simplified—one policy, one renewal
- Standard for small nonprofits

**Year 1-2 Recommendation**: Purchase BOP instead of separate GL + Property
**Premium**: $2,000-$4,000/year (GL + Property + Business Interruption combined)

---

## Event Insurance

### Coverage Purpose

**What It Covers**: Liability and cancellation costs for one-time events—conferences, galas, walks/runs, symposiums.

**Why Needed**:
- Event venues require proof of insurance
- Hundreds of attendees = higher injury risk
- Weather/illness could force cancellation (lose $50K-$200K deposits)

---

### Event Liability Insurance

**Per-Event Coverage**:
- **General Liability**: $1M per occurrence (covers attendee injuries)
- **Liquor Liability**: $1M (if serving alcohol at gala)
- **Host Liquor Liability**: Included (if cash bar, venue has liquor license)
- **Premium**: $500-$1,500 per event (depends on attendees, alcohol, activities)

**When to Purchase**:
- Annual patient conference (500 attendees)
- Gala fundraiser (300 attendees, alcohol)
- Walk/run event (200 participants, outdoor)

**When to Skip**:
- Small support group meeting (15 people, covered by annual GL policy)
- Webinar (no physical attendees, no injury risk)

---

### Event Cancellation Insurance

**What It Covers**: Non-refundable deposits and prepaid expenses if Foundation must cancel event due to covered peril.

**Covered Perils**:
- ✅ Severe weather (hurricane, blizzard makes travel impossible)
- ✅ Keynote speaker illness/death
- ✅ Venue fire/damage
- ✅ Terrorism threat (credible threat forces cancellation)
- ✅ Communicable disease outbreak (e.g., COVID-19—if purchased before outbreak known)

**NOT Covered**:
- ❌ Low attendance/ticket sales (financial loss not covered)
- ❌ Foundation changes mind (voluntary cancellation)
- ❌ Vendor fails to perform (sue vendor instead)

**Coverage Amount**: Total non-refundable costs (venue deposit, catering, speaker fees, printing)

**Example**:
- Annual conference budget: $150,000
- Non-refundable: $100,000 (venue, catering, speaker travel)
- Event cancellation coverage: $100,000
- Premium: $2,000-$5,000 (2-5% of coverage)

**When to Purchase**: For large events (>$50K non-refundable costs) where cancellation would cause financial hardship

---

## Insurance Carrier Selection

### Carrier Evaluation Criteria

**Financial Strength** (Most Important):
- **A.M. Best Rating**: A- or higher (A++, A+, A preferred)
- **S&P Rating**: A- or higher
- **Why It Matters**: Carrier must be financially stable to pay claims 5-10 years from now

**Claims Service**:
- Online claims portal (file claims 24/7)
- Dedicated claims adjuster or shared pool?
- Average time to settle claims (ask broker for data)
- Reputation for paying vs. denying claims

**Nonprofit Experience**:
- Does carrier specialize in nonprofits? (Hartford, Philadelphia Insurance, GuideOne)
- Do they understand 501(c)(3) risks?
- Can they provide nonprofit-specific policy forms?

**Price** (But Not Only Factor):
- Get 3 quotes (different carriers)
- Compare apples-to-apples (same limits, deductibles)
- Cheapest may have coverage gaps

---

### Recommended Carriers for Nonprofits

**Top Tier** (Best for Established Foundations, Year 3+):
- **The Hartford**: A+ A.M. Best, strong nonprofit division, broad coverage
- **Philadelphia Insurance**: A+ A.M. Best, nonprofit specialists, EPLI experts
- **Chubb**: A++ A.M. Best, premium pricing, excellent claims service
- **Travelers**: A++ A.M. Best, competitive pricing, strong cyber liability

**Good Options** (Year 1-2, Smaller Budgets):
- **GuideOne**: A nonprofit-only carrier, religious org focus but covers health advocacy
- **NAIC (Nonprofits' Insurance Alliance)**: Member-owned, nonprofit-only, good pricing
- **Hiscox**: Strong cyber liability, good for small orgs

**Avoid**:
- Carriers rated B+ or below (financial instability risk)
- Carriers with no nonprofit experience (coverage gaps likely)

---

## Premium Budgeting & Cost Management

### Annual Insurance Budget by Year

**Year 1** (5-10 employees, $500K budget):
| **Coverage**              | **Premium**  |
| ------------------------- | ------------ |
| BOP (GL + Property)       | $2,500       |
| D&O                       | $4,000       |

### Cost-Saving Strategies

**Bundle Policies** (5-15% discount):
- Purchase GL, Property, Auto from same carrier (BOP)
- Purchase D&O, EPLI, Cyber from same carrier (Management Liability Package)

**Higher Deductibles** (20-30% lower premium):
- D&O: $25K deductible instead of $5K (saves $1,500/year)
- Cyber: $25K deductible instead of $5K (saves $2,000/year)
- **Tradeoff**: Foundation pays more out-of-pocket if claim occurs

**Risk Management Credits** (10-20% discount):
- Implement written safety program (Workers' Comp discount)
- Annual cybersecurity audit (Cyber Liability discount)
- HR hotline/legal advice service (EPLI discount)

**Multi-Year Policies** (5-10% discount):
- Lock in 2-3 year rate (protects against rate increases)
- **Risk**: Locked into higher rate if market softens

**Shop Annually** (But Don't Switch Frivolously):
- Get 3 quotes each renewal
- Switch carriers if >15% savings with equal coverage
- Don't switch for <10% savings (relationship value, claims history)

## Claims Filing Procedures

### Step-by-Step Claims Process

**1. Incident Occurs**

**Immediate Actions** (within 24 hours):
- Ensure safety (medical care for injured, secure property)
- Document scene (photos, witness statements, incident report)
- Notify insurance broker (email/phone)
- Preserve evidence (damaged equipment, security footage)

**Do NOT**:
- Admit fault ("I'm sorry this happened" is okay, "This is our fault" is not)
- Promise to pay ("Insurance will handle this")
- Discuss with anyone except insurer, broker, attorney

---

**2. Notify Insurance Carrier**

**Required Information**:
- Policy number
- Date/time/location of incident
- Description of what happened (facts only, no opinions)
- Names of injured parties, witnesses
- Police report number (if applicable)
- Estimated damages

**Notification Timeline**:
- **Immediate**: General Liability, Workers' Comp (within 24 hours)
- **Promptly**: D&O, EPLI, Cyber Liability (within 2-7 days of becoming aware)
- **Late Notice = Denied Claim**: Most policies require "prompt" notice (courts interpret as "reasonable time under circumstances")

---

**3. Claims Investigation**

**Carrier's Process**:
- Assign claims adjuster (phone call within 48 hours)
- Investigate liability (interview parties, review documents)
- Determine coverage (is this a covered claim? any exclusions?)
- Estimate damages (obtain repair quotes, medical bills)
- Decide to defend or settle

**Foundation's Cooperation Duties**:
- Provide documents (contracts, emails, policies, incident reports)
- Make employees available for interviews
- Don't speak to plaintiff's attorney (refer to insurer's attorney)
- Don't settle without carrier approval (voids coverage)

---

**4. Claims Resolution**

**Possible Outcomes**:
- **Carrier Denies Coverage**: Foundation must defend/settle on own (hire attorney to dispute denial if coverage should apply)
- **Carrier Defends**: Appoints attorney, pays defense costs, negotiates settlement
- **Settlement**: Carrier pays plaintiff (within policy limits), case closed
- **Trial**: If no settlement, case goes to trial (carrier pays defense costs + judgment up to policy limit)

**Timeline**:
- Minor claims (property damage, small injury): 30-90 days to settle
- Major claims (serious injury, lawsuit): 1-3 years to resolve
- D&O claims: 2-5 years (complex investigations, high stakes)

---

### Claims Documentation Best Practices

**Maintain Incident File** (one folder per incident):
- Incident report (who, what, when, where)
- Photos/videos
- Witness statements
- Medical records (if injury)
- Repair estimates
- Correspondence with carrier/attorney
- Settlement documents

**Retention**: Keep for 7 years after claim closed (statute of limitations + margin)

---

### Common Claim Denials & How to Avoid

**Denial Reason**: "Late Notice" (Foundation didn't report promptly)
- **Prevention**: Report all potential claims immediately (even if unclear if covered—let carrier decide)

**Denial Reason**: "Exclusion Applies" (claim falls under policy exclusion)
- **Prevention**: Read policy exclusions carefully, purchase endorsements to remove exclusions if needed

**Denial Reason**: "Outside Policy Period" (incident occurred before policy started, claim filed after policy ended)
- **Prevention**: Purchase "tail coverage" when switching claims-made policies (D&O, EPLI, Professional Liability)

**Denial Reason**: "Insured Breached Cooperation Clause" (Foundation failed to cooperate with investigation)
- **Prevention**: Respond promptly to adjuster requests, provide documents

**Denial Reason**: "Intentional Act" (Foundation/employee intentionally caused harm)
- **Prevention**: None—intentional acts are uninsurable (public policy)

---

## Certificate of Insurance (COI) Management

### What Is COI

**Certificate of Insurance**: Document proving Foundation has insurance coverage, issued by insurance broker to third party (venue, landlord, grant funder).

**What COI Shows**:
- Types of coverage (GL, D&O, Cyber, etc.)
- Policy limits
- Effective dates
- Carrier name and rating
- Certificate holder (entity being provided proof—e.g., event venue)
- Additional insured status (if venue added to GL policy)

**What COI Does NOT Do**: COI is evidence of insurance, not a contract—policy governs coverage, not COI

---

### When COI Required

**Common Scenarios**:
- **Event Venue**: Requires Foundation to carry $1M GL, name venue as Additional Insured
- **Office Lease**: Landlord requires $1M GL, names landlord as Additional Insured
- **Grant Agreement**: Funder requires D&O insurance (rarely requests COI, but some do)
- **Pharmaceutical Partnership**: Company requires $5M GL + $5M Professional Liability (high-revenue partnerships)
- **Volunteer Events**: Some venues require even for volunteer activities

---

### How to Request COI

**Process**:
1. Obtain requirements from third party (venue contract, lease, grant agreement—read insurance requirements section)
2. Email insurance broker: "Please issue COI to [Certificate Holder Name/Address], showing [coverage types/limits], [Additional Insured if required]"
3. Broker issues COI (usually within 24 hours, free)
4. Provide COI to third party (email PDF)
5. File copy in insurance folder

**Typical Broker Turnaround**: Same day to 48 hours (plan ahead for events)

---

### COI Review Checklist

**Before Sending COI to Third Party, Verify**:
- ✅ Certificate Holder name/address correct (exact match to contract)
- ✅ Coverage types listed match requirements (GL, D&O, etc.)
- ✅ Limits meet or exceed requirements ($1M vs. $2M)
- ✅ Additional Insured box checked (if required)
- ✅ Effective dates cover event date or lease term
- ✅ Broker signed certificate

**If COI Doesn't Match Requirements**:
- Contact broker to revise (add coverage, increase limits, add Additional Insured endorsement)
- May require purchasing additional coverage or higher limits (cost $100-$5,000 depending on gap)

## Annual Insurance Review

### Review Process & Timeline

**Annual Review Schedule** (60-90 days before renewal):

| **Timeline**  | **Action**                                                       | **Owner** |

### Insurance Review Checklist

**Annual Review Questions**:

**Coverage Adequacy**:
- ❓ Has Foundation's revenue/assets increased 20%+ since last year? (Increase limits)
- ❓ New programs launched (patient navigation, research)? (Add Professional Liability)
- ❓ Employee count increased 50%+? (Review Workers' Comp, EPLI)
- ❓ Patient registry grown to 3,000+? (Increase Cyber Liability to $5M)
- ❓ Hosting large event (>500 attendees)? (Purchase Event Insurance)

**Cost Optimization**:
- ❓ Can we increase deductibles to lower premium? (Board risk tolerance)
- ❓ Can we bundle policies for discount?
- ❓ Are we eligible for risk management credits? (Implement programs to qualify)

**Carrier Performance**:
- ❓ Were any claims filed this year? How did carrier handle?
- ❓ Is carrier's financial rating still A- or better? (Check A.M. Best)
- ❓ Has carrier increased premiums >15% without claims? (Shop competitors)

**Policy Endorsements**:
- ❓ Do we need to add/remove Additional Insureds?
- ❓ Are there new exclusions in renewal policy? (Negotiate removal)
- ❓ Do we need tail coverage for claims-made policies? (If switching carriers)

---

### Board of Directors Insurance Briefing

## Broker Relationships

### Why Use Insurance Broker (Not Direct)

**Broker Advantages**:
- Represents Foundation (not carrier)—advocates for best coverage/price
- Access to 20+ carriers (vs. 1 if buying direct)
- Expertise in nonprofit insurance (knows coverage gaps)
- Handles paperwork, COIs, claims advocacy
- No extra cost (broker paid by carrier commission)

**Direct Purchase Disadvantages**:
- Only 1 carrier option (no price competition)
- Carrier agent represents carrier (not Foundation)
- Less expertise in nonprofit risks

**Recommendation**: Use independent broker (Year 1 onward)

---

### Selecting Insurance Broker

**Evaluation Criteria**:

**Nonprofit Expertise**:
- ❓ Does broker have 10+ nonprofit clients similar size/mission?
- ❓ Do they understand 501(c)(3) risks (D&O, EPLI, Cyber)?
- ❓ Can they provide references from other health advocacy nonprofits?

**Carrier Access**:
- ❓ Does broker have appointments with 15+ carriers?
- ❓ Do they have access to nonprofit specialists (GuideOne, NAIC, Philadelphia Insurance)?

**Service Level**:
- ❓ Dedicated account manager or will Foundation be passed around?
- ❓ Response time (same day, 24 hours, week)?
- ❓ COI turnaround time (same day preferred)
- ❓ Claims advocacy (will broker fight carrier if claim denied)?

**Cost**:
- ❓ Broker commission (typically 10-15% of premium—paid by carrier, not Foundation)
- ❓ Any fees beyond commission? (Avoid brokers charging consulting fees on top of commission)

---

### Broker Communication & Expectations

**Annual Touchpoints**:
- Renewal (90 days before expiration)
- Mid-year check-in (review any program changes, upcoming events needing coverage)
- Claims support (as needed)
- COI requests (as needed—can be 5-20/year for active Foundation)

**Response Time Expectations**:
- COI requests: Same day or next business day
- Coverage questions: Within 24 hours
- Claims support: Same day (if urgent)

**Red Flags** (Time to Switch Brokers):
- COI requests take 3+ days
- Broker doesn't return calls within 48 hours
- Renewal quotes arrive 15 days before expiration (too late to shop)
- Broker pushes one carrier without competitive quotes

---

### Recommended Brokers for Nonprofits

**National Brokers with Nonprofit Practices**:
- **Marsh McLennan**: Large brokerages with dedicated nonprofit division
- **Aon**: Strong D&O and cyber liability expertise
- **Lockton**: Nonprofit practice, mid-size clients

**Regional/Local Brokers** (Often Better Service for Small Nonprofits):
- Find broker through Nonprofit Risk Management Center (www.nonprofitrisk.org)
- Ask other local nonprofits for referrals

**Avoid**:
- Brokers who sell only insurance (no risk management advice)
- Brokers representing <5 carriers (limited options)

---

## Conclusion

### Insurance as Mission Enabler

**Foundation's Perspective**: Insurance is not overhead waste—it's mission protection.

**Without Adequate Insurance**:
- One data breach could bankrupt Foundation ($500K+ costs)
- Board members won't serve (personal liability exposure)
- Event venues won't host (no liability coverage)
- Pharmaceutical partners won't collaborate (no Professional Liability)
- Grant funders question governance (no D&O insurance)

**With Comprehensive Insurance**:
- Board focuses on mission (not personal liability fear)
- Staff take calculated risks (know Foundation is protected)
- Donors trust Foundation (see risk management maturity)
- Patients trust data security (robust cyber coverage)

---

### Insurance Budget as % of Operating Budget

**Year 1-2**: 2.5-3% of budget (higher % when small)
**Year 3-5**: 1.5-2% of budget (economies of scale)
**Mature Foundation**: 1-1.5% of budget

**Benchmark**: Nonprofits spending <1% are likely underinsured, >3% may be over-insured or have poor risk management

---
