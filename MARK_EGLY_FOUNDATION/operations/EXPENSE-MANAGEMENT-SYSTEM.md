## Expense Management Philosophy

### Foundation's Stewardship Principles

**Principle 1: Donor Fund Accountability**
Every expense must advance Foundation mission—serving AATD patients through education, research, advocacy, or support.

**Principle 2: Frugality with Excellence**
Choose cost-effective options that maintain quality—not cheapest (false economy) nor extravagant (poor stewardship).

**Principle 3: Transparency**
All expenses documented, approved, and auditable—no hidden costs, no "creative" accounting.

**Principle 4: Compliance First**
IRS regulations govern nonprofit expenses—when in doubt, consult accountant or choose more conservative option.

**Principle 5: Fairness & Consistency**
Same rules for ED and entry-level staff—no double standards, no special treatment.

---

### IRS Requirements for Nonprofit Expenses

**Accountable Plan** (IRS Safe Harbor):
- Expenses must have **business connection** (directly related to Foundation work)
- Expenses must be **substantiated** (receipts, documentation of purpose)
- Excess reimbursements must be **returned** (if employee overpaid, repay within 120 days)

**If Foundation Fails Accountable Plan Test**:
- Reimbursements treated as taxable income to employee
- Foundation must report on W-2, withhold taxes
- Employee loses tax deduction (can't deduct unreimbursed business expenses post-2018 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act)

**Foundation's Commitment**: Maintain accountable plan status—protects employees from tax liability, demonstrates good governance.

## Expense Policy Overview

### Expense Categories & Annual Budgets

**Year 1 Budget** (5-10 employees, $500K total budget):

| **Category**                | **Annual Budget** | **% of Total** | **Primary Uses**                          |

### Who Can Incur Expenses

**All Staff**: Can incur job-related expenses with appropriate approval (see approval matrix below).

**Board Members**:
- Can be reimbursed for Board meeting travel, lodging (if out-of-town)
- Cannot be reimbursed for meals during local Board meetings (normal governance duty)
- Special projects: If Board member traveling for Foundation fundraising, grant review—reimbursable

**Volunteers**:
- Can be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses (mileage to support group, supplies for events)
- Must follow same policies as staff (receipts, approval, documentation)

**Contractors/Consultants**:
- Expenses addressed in contract (typically contractor responsible for own expenses)
- If contract allows reimbursement, follow same policies

---

## Travel Expense Policies

### Airfare Policy

**Booking Guidelines**:
- **Class**: Economy/coach only (business/first class not reimbursed without Board Chair pre-approval)
- **Advance Booking**: Book 21+ days before travel (lower fares)
  - Exception: Emergency travel (crisis, unplanned donor meeting)
- **Fare Limits**:
  - Domestic: Target ≤$500 round-trip (exceptions: cross-country, peak season)
  - International: Target ≤$1,200 round-trip (exceptions: long-haul)
- **Baggage Fees**: First checked bag reimbursed (standard for business travel), second bag only if transporting Foundation materials

**Booking Process**:
1. Employee searches flights (Google Flights, airline websites)
2. Submits travel request (see pre-approval section)
3. Once approved, books directly or through Foundation travel agent (if established)
4. Submits expense report with receipt after travel

**Non-Reimbursable**:
- ❌ Upgrades (extra legroom, priority boarding) unless medically necessary (ADA accommodation)
- ❌ Travel insurance (unless international travel >$2,000 or high-risk destination)
- ❌ In-flight Wi-Fi, movies, alcohol

---

### Ground Transportation

**Airport Transfers**:
- **Preferred**: Ride-share (Uber/Lyft), airport shuttle, public transit
- **Taxis**: Allowed if ride-share unavailable or unsafe (late night)
- **Rental Cars**: Only if destination lacks public transit or multiple stops required
  - Compact/economy class only (mid-size if 3+ passengers)
  - Decline insurance if Foundation's insurance covers (check with insurance broker)
- **Parking**: Long-term airport parking reimbursed (cheaper than daily ride-share if 4+ days)

**Mileage vs. Rental Car Decision**:
- If driving >200 miles, consider rental car (may be cheaper than mileage reimbursement)
- Calculate: Rental ($40-$60/day + gas $30) vs. Mileage (200 miles × $0.67 = $134)

**Personal Car for Business Travel**:
- Reimbursed at IRS mileage rate (see mileage section)
- Not allowed if air travel clearly more economical (e.g., driving 800 miles when flight costs $300)

---

## Meal & Entertainment Expenses

### Business Meal Policy

**When Meals Are Reimbursable**:
- ✅ **Donor cultivation meals**: Taking donor to lunch/dinner to discuss support
- ✅ **Partner meetings**: Meals with pharmaceutical partners, academic collaborators
- ✅ **Staff working meals**: Team lunch during all-day planning retreat
- ✅ **Conference meals**: If not included in conference registration
- ✅ **Overnight travel meals**: Per diem or actual expenses (see below)

**When Meals Are NOT Reimbursable**:
- ❌ Normal lunch at office (personal expense)
- ❌ Coffee/snacks at desk (personal expense)
- ❌ Team lunches without business purpose (morale events—budgeted separately as staff appreciation)

---

### Meal Reimbursement Methods

**Option 1: Per Diem** (Simplest)

**Daily Allowance** (based on GSA rates—varies by city):
- **Breakfast**: $15
- **Lunch**: $20
- **Dinner**: $30
- **Daily Total**: $65 (average—adjust for high-cost cities like NYC, SF)

**How It Works**:
- Employee travels, receives flat $65/day (no receipts required for meals <$75/day per IRS)
- Cannot claim both per diem AND actual meals (choose one per trip)

**Best For**: Multi-day conference travel, staff without time to track receipts.

---

**Option 2: Actual Expenses** (Requires Receipts)

**Meal Limits**:
- Breakfast: $25 max
- Lunch: $35 max
- Dinner: $60 max (including tip, tax)

**When to Use**:
- Business meals with donors, partners (need receipt for guest names, business purpose)
- High-cost cities where per diem insufficient
- Employee prefers tracking actual vs. per diem

**Documentation Required**:
- Itemized receipt (not just credit card slip)
- Business purpose: "Donor cultivation lunch with [Name]—discussed Year 2 gift"
- Attendees: List all people present

---

### Alcohol Policy

**General Rule**: Alcohol at business meals is reimbursable in moderation.

**Limits**:
- 2 drinks maximum per person per meal
- Must be part of business meal (not standalone bar tab)
- Total meal cost (including alcohol) must stay within limits ($60 dinner max)

**When Alcohol NOT Allowed**:
- ❌ Staff lunch (no wine with team working lunch)
- ❌ Solo meals (no reimbursing staff member's personal cocktail)
- ❌ Excessive drinking (Foundation won't reimburse $100 bar tab—judgment applies)

**Cultural Considerations**: If donor/partner expects wine at dinner (common in pharma relationships), allowed within reason. Document business purpose clearly.

---

## Lodging Standards

### Hotel Selection Guidelines

**Rate Limits** (per night, before taxes):
- **Standard cities**: $150-$200/night
- **High-cost cities** (NYC, SF, DC, Boston): $250-$300/night
- **Conference hotels**: Book conference rate (often negotiated discount)

**Booking Process**:
- Check conference hotel first (convenience, networking)
- If conference hotel exceeds limits, consider nearby hotels (Hilton Garden Inn, Courtyard, Hampton Inn—mid-range business hotels)
- Book directly or through hotel booking sites (Hotels.com, Expedia—compare prices)

**Sharing Rooms**:
- Not required (Foundation doesn't require staff to share rooms—privacy, professionalism)
- If staff voluntarily share (e.g., friends), Foundation reimburses actual room cost, not two separate rates

---

### Hotel Amenities

**Reimbursable**:
- ✅ Standard room rate + taxes
- ✅ Wi-Fi (if not free—most business hotels include)
- ✅ Parking (if required)

**Not Reimbursable**:
- ❌ In-room movies, minibar, spa services
- ❌ Upgraded rooms (suite, concierge level) unless medically necessary
- ❌ Late checkout fees (plan departure appropriately)
- ❌ Pet fees (personal expense unless service animal)

---

### Alternative Lodging

**Airbnb/VRBO**:
- Allowed if:
  - Cheaper than hotels in area
  - Professional listing (not someone's lived-in home—awkward for business travel)
  - Safe neighborhood, good reviews
- Limit: Same as hotel rate limits ($150-$300/night depending on city)

**Staying with Friends/Family**:
- If employee stays with friend/family instead of hotel, Foundation may offer thank-you gift to host ($50-$100 gift card) OR
- Reimburse employee nominal amount ($50/night "inconvenience fee")
- Saves Foundation money, employee choice

---

## Mileage Reimbursement

### IRS Standard Mileage Rate

**Current Rate** (2025): **$0.67/mile** (IRS rate—adjusted annually for inflation, fuel costs)

**What's Included**:
- Gas, oil, maintenance, depreciation, insurance
- Employee doesn't need receipts for gas (mileage rate covers all costs)

**Foundation Policy**: Reimburse at IRS rate (protects tax-free status, fair to employees).

---

### Mileage Calculation

**Reimbursable Miles**: Business miles only (not commute to regular office)

**Examples**:

**Scenario 1: Donor Meeting Across Town**
- Employee drives from home to donor's office (20 miles)
- Donor meeting, drives home (20 miles)
- **Reimbursable**: 40 miles × $0.67 = $26.80

**Scenario 2: Multi-Stop Day**
- Employee drives to support group (15 miles), then patient home visit (10 miles), then office (5 miles), then home (10 miles)
- **Reimbursable**: 40 miles × $0.67 = $26.80

**Scenario 3: Commute Exception**
- Employee normally commutes to office (10 miles each way, 20 miles/day)
- One day, drives directly from home to support group (30 miles), then home (30 miles)
- **Reimbursable**: 60 miles - 20 miles (normal commute) = 40 miles × $0.67 = $26.80
- **Logic**: Only reimburse miles BEYOND normal commute

---

### Mileage Documentation

**Mileage Log Required**:
- Date of travel
- Starting address & destination
- Business purpose
- Odometer reading (start & end) OR Google Maps distance
- Total miles

**Mileage Log Template** (spreadsheet or app):

| **Date**   | **From**       | **To**         | **Purpose**            | **Miles** | **Reimbursement** |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| 11/9/2025  | Home           | Support Group  | Facilitate peer group  | 30        | $20.10            |
| 11/9/2025  | Support Group  | Donor Office   | Cultivation meeting    | 15        | $10.05            |
| 11/9/2025  | Donor Office   | Home           | Return                 | 25        | $16.75            |
| **Total**  |                |                |                        | **70**    | **$46.90**        |

**Apps**: MileIQ, Everlance, TripLog (auto-track via GPS, categorize business vs. personal)—cost $5-$10/month, Foundation can reimburse for staff who drive frequently.

---

---

### Reimbursement Methods

**Check** (Standard):
- Issued twice monthly (1st and 15th)
- Mailed to home address or available for office pickup

**Direct Deposit** (Preferred):
- Added to regular paycheck (if payroll system allows) OR
- Separate ACH transfer to employee's bank account
- Faster, more secure

**Payroll Advance** (Exceptional):
- If employee fronted large expense ($1,000+), experiencing financial hardship
- Can request advance reimbursement (COO approval required)

---

## Credit Card Usage Policies

### Foundation Credit Cards

**Who Gets Cards**:
- Executive Director (Visa/MC, $10K limit)
- Chief Operating Officer (Visa/MC, $5K limit)
- Development Director (Visa/MC, $5K limit)
- **Total**: 3 cards max (controls fraud risk, simplifies reconciliation)

**When to Use Foundation Card**:
- Booking travel (hotels, airfare)
- Conference registrations
- Large purchases ($500+)
- Recurring subscriptions (software, memberships)

**When NOT to Use**:
- Personal expenses (never—terminable offense)
- Cash advances (not allowed)
- Balance carry-over (pay in full monthly—no interest charges)

---

### Credit Card Reconciliation

**Monthly Process**:
1. **Statement Review**: Treasurer reviews all credit card statements by 10th of following month
2. **Receipt Matching**: Accountant matches each charge to receipt, business purpose
3. **Cardholder Certification**: Cardholder signs statement: "All charges are legitimate Foundation expenses"
4. **Red Flag Review**: Treasurer flags any questionable charges (unusual vendors, round numbers, excessive amounts)
5. **Investigation**: If red flags identified, COO or ED investigates (could indicate fraud or policy violation)

**Consequences for Misuse**:
- First offense: Written warning, card suspended 90 days
- Second offense: Card revoked permanently
- Personal use >$500: Termination (fraud)

---

## Receipt Requirements

### When Receipts Required

**Always Required** (100% of time):
- Expenses >$75 (IRS requires receipts for >$75)
- Meals (to document attendees, business purpose—even if <$75)
- Lodging (hotel folio showing itemized charges)
- Airfare (boarding pass + receipt)
- Conference registration (registration confirmation + receipt)

**Not Required**:
- Mileage (mileage log suffices)
- Per diem meals (if choosing per diem method)

---

### Acceptable Receipt Formats

**Original Itemized Receipt** (Best):
- Restaurant: Itemized receipt showing food/drink ordered, not just credit card slip
- Hotel: Folio showing nightly rate breakdown, not just final total
- Airline: E-ticket receipt showing fare breakdown

**Scanned/Photographed Receipt** (Accepted):
- High-quality photo (readable, not blurry)
- All corners visible (proves receipt not altered)
- Uploaded to expense report

**Credit Card Statement** (Not Sufficient):
- Credit card statement alone doesn't prove business purpose
- Must have itemized receipt + credit card statement

---

### Lost Receipt Policy

**If Receipt Lost**:
- Submit **Lost Receipt Affidavit**: Employee signs statement attesting to expense details (date, vendor, amount, business purpose)
- Allowed occasionally (1-2 per year), but pattern of lost receipts = poor record-keeping (counseling, potential reimbursement denial)

**Lost Receipt Affidavit Template**:
> I, [Employee Name], attest that on [Date], I incurred the following business expense:
>
> - **Vendor**: [Name]
> - **Amount**: $[Amount]
> - **Business Purpose**: [Description]
>
> I have lost the original receipt and certify this expense was legitimate Foundation business.
>
> Signature: _______________ Date: _______________

---

## Approval Workflows

### Approval Matrix by Expense Amount

| **Expense Amount** | **Approver**                   | **Timeline**    | **Documentation**                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **<$100**          | Direct Manager                 | 24 hours        | Receipt, business purpose              |
| **$100-$500**      | Manager → Department Head      | 48 hours        | Receipt, business purpose, budget code |
| **$500-$5,000**    | Department Head → COO/ED       | 3-5 days        | All above + quotes/justification       |
| **>$5,000**        | COO/ED → Board Treasurer       | 1-2 weeks       | All above + Board memo if >$25K        |

---

### Manager Responsibilities

**What Managers Approve**:
- Expense is legitimate Foundation business (not personal)
- Amount is reasonable (not excessive)
- Budget available (department hasn't exceeded annual budget)
- Complies with policy (receipts attached, timely submission)

**What Managers Reject**:
- Personal expenses (coffee on way to work, personal errands)
- Policy violations (first-class airfare without pre-approval, excessive meal costs)
- Poor documentation (no receipt, unclear business purpose)
- Budget exhausted (department over budget—expense deferred or funded differently)

**Manager Rejections**: Employee resubmits with corrections OR employee pays out-of-pocket (not reimbursed).

---

## Pre-Approval Requirements

### When Pre-Approval Required

**Mandatory Pre-Approval** (before booking/purchasing):
- All travel (airfare, hotel, conference registration)
- Expenses >$500
- New vendors (first-time purchases from unfamiliar company)
- International travel
- Equipment purchases (computers, software, furniture)

**Pre-Approval Form**:
- **What**: Description of expense (conference name, travel purpose)
- **Why**: Business justification (why necessary for mission)
- **How Much**: Estimated cost (quotes, conference website pricing)
- **When**: Dates (travel dates, conference dates)
- **Budget Source**: Which budget line item (Travel, Professional Development, Supplies)

**Approval Process**: Submit form → Manager reviews → Approves or requests changes → Employee proceeds with purchase.

---

### Pre-Approval Benefits

**For Employee**:
- Confidence expense will be reimbursed (no surprise denials after spending money)
- Budget allocated (won't hear "sorry, no budget left")

**For Foundation**:
- Budget control (prevents overspending)
- Advance notice (can reallocate budgets if multiple requests in one month)
- Fraud prevention (manager reviews necessity before expense incurred)

---

## Non-Reimbursable Expenses

### Personal Expenses (Never Reimbursed)

- ❌ Commute to regular office (normal cost of employment)
- ❌ Childcare during business hours (personal responsibility)
- ❌ Clothing, grooming, dry cleaning (unless uniform required—Foundation doesn't require uniforms)
- ❌ Personal entertainment (movies, concerts, personal gym memberships)
- ❌ Traffic tickets, parking violations (personal responsibility)
- ❌ Personal credit card interest, late fees (if employee uses personal card and pays late—Foundation reimburses charge but not late fees)

---

### Excessive/Luxury Expenses

- ❌ First-class airfare (without Board Chair pre-approval for exceptional circumstances—e.g., CEO of partner company expects business-class treatment, medical necessity)
- ❌ Luxury hotels (>$300/night without COO pre-approval)
- ❌ Expensive restaurants (>$60/person for dinner without justification—e.g., Michelin-star restaurant to impress major donor = maybe allowed)
- ❌ Limousine service (use Uber/Lyft/taxi—limos are optics problem for nonprofit)

---

### Gifts & Gratuities

**Foundation Policy**: Foundation does not reimburse gifts to employees from donors/vendors (creates appearance of impropriety).

**Gifts TO Donors/Partners**:
- Allowed within limits: $25-$100 gift to thank donor (flowers, gift basket)
- Requires pre-approval (Development Director or ED)
- Documented (gift log—who received, why, when)
- Not cash/cash equivalents (no gift cards >$25—looks like kickback)

**Charitable Contributions**:
- Employees cannot charge personal charitable donations to Foundation credit card (even if good cause—not Foundation's mission)

---

## Expense Reporting Systems

### Manual System (Year 1-2)

**Tools**:
- Excel template (expense report spreadsheet)
- Email submission (employee emails expense report + receipts to manager)
- Paper receipts filed in accounting (7-year retention)

**Pros**: Free, simple, low-tech
**Cons**: Time-consuming, error-prone, hard to audit trends

---

### Automated System (Year 3+)

**Software Options**:
- **Expensify**: $5-$10/user/month, receipt scanning, mileage tracking, credit card integration
- **Concur**: Enterprise-level, $8-$15/user/month, robust approval workflows, grant accounting
- **Zoho Expense**: Budget-friendly, $3-$5/user/month, integrates with QuickBooks
- **Ramp**: Free (earns revenue via corporate card usage), modern UI, receipt automation

**Features to Look For**:
- Receipt photo capture (snap photo, auto-extract amount/vendor)
- Mileage tracking (GPS-based or manual entry)
- Approval workflows (routes to manager, then COO, then accounting)
- Accounting integration (exports to QuickBooks, feeds general ledger)
- Policy enforcement (flags expenses exceeding limits before submission)
- Grant tracking (allocate expenses to specific grants)

**ROI**: $5/user/month × 20 employees = $100/month = $1,200/year, saves 40+ hours/year staff time (worth $2,000+).

---

### Best Practices for Expense Systems

**Employee Training**: Annual training on expense policy, system usage (30-min session each January).

**Policy Reminders**: Include policy summary in expense submission email confirmations ("Remember: receipts required for >$75, mileage at $0.67/mile").

**Audit Trails**: System logs all approvals, edits, rejections (accountability, fraud detection).

## Audit & Compliance

### Quarterly Expense Audits

**Treasurer Reviews** (quarterly):
- Random sample of 20 expense reports (all employees, including ED)
- Verify receipts present, business purpose documented, approvals obtained
- Check for trends (one employee claiming excessive meals? department over budget?)

**Red Flags**:
- Round numbers ($100.00 meals—may indicate estimate, not actual)
- Frequent "lost receipts"
- Expenses just under approval thresholds ($499 when threshold is $500—avoiding oversight)
- Same vendor repeatedly (potential kickback scheme)
- Excessive spending by one employee (lifestyle beyond salary—fraud indicator)

**Audit Findings**: Reported to Board Audit Committee (quarterly), corrective action if patterns identified.

### Annual External Audit

**Financial Audit Includes Expense Testing**:
- CPA auditor samples expense transactions (typically 25-50 transactions)
- Tests for: Receipt present, proper approval, reasonable amount, business purpose
- Auditor opines whether expenses comply with IRS accountable plan

**Audit Failures**: If auditor finds material weaknesses (10%+ of expenses lack receipts, approvals missing):
- Management letter issued (Foundation must correct weaknesses)
- Could jeopardize 501(c)(3) status (IRS requires proper expense controls)

### IRS Form 990 Reporting

**Part VI, Question 2**: "Did the organization have a written expense reimbursement policy?"
- Foundation must answer "Yes" (this document is the policy)

**Schedule O**: If any expenses unusual (e.g., $50K travel for small org), explain in supplemental disclosures.

**Officer Compensation (Part VII)**: ED's total compensation includes salary + benefits + reimbursed expenses IF expenses treated as compensation (Foundation's accountable plan ensures reimbursements NOT reported as compensation).

## Budget & Cost Management

### Expense Budget Allocation

**Annual Budget Process** (see Budget Development Process document):
- Each department submits expense budget (travel, meals, professional development)
- COO consolidates, negotiates trade-offs (Program wants $30K travel, Finance offers $25K)
- Board approves final budget

**Monthly Tracking**:
- Accountant tracks actual expenses vs. budget (variance reports)
- Red flag if department 50% over budget by mid-year
- Manager explains variance ("Unexpected conference opportunity, shifted funds from supplies")

### Cost-Saving Strategies

**Travel Hacking** (Ethical):
- ✅ Book flights on Tuesdays (historically cheaper)
- ✅ Use flight alerts (Google Flights, Hopper—notify when prices drop)
- ✅ Bundle hotel + flight (Expedia, Priceline packages save 10-20%)
- ✅ Join hotel/airline loyalty programs (free, earn points—but points belong to employee, not Foundation—IRS gray area, generally allowed)

**What NOT to Do**:
- ❌ Book refundable tickets, cancel, keep credit for personal use (fraud)
- ❌ Expense personal trip as business (fraud)
- ❌ Split expenses across budget codes to hide overages (financial misrepresentation)

---

### Cost Benchmarking

**Peer Comparison** (annually):
- Compare Foundation's expense ratios to peer organizations (GuideStar, Form 990 data)
- **Travel + Conferences / Total Budget**: Should be 3-8% (higher for advocacy orgs, lower for direct service)
- **Meals + Entertainment / Total Budget**: Should be 1-2%
- If Foundation spending 15% on travel—Board questions whether excessive

## Conclusion

### Expense Management as Donor Stewardship

**Bottom Line**: Donors entrust Foundation with funds to serve AATD patients. Expense policy ensures funds used efficiently, transparently, and in compliance with law.

**Culture of Accountability**: From ED to entry-level staff, everyone follows same rules—no entitlement, no "perks" inappropriate for nonprofit.

**Continuous Improvement**: Review expense policy annually—update for IRS rate changes, technology improvements, lessons learned.
