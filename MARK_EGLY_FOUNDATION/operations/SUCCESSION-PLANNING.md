## Succession Planning Philosophy

### Why Succession Planning Matters

**The Risk**: Organizations without succession plans face:
- **Mission Disruption**: Services halted, programs cancelled, grants lost
- **Financial Crisis**: Donors withdraw, funders hesitate, revenue drops 20-40%
- **Staff Exodus**: Key employees leave during uncertainty (40% turnover in transition year)
- **Board Dysfunction**: Leadership vacuum, infighting, strategic drift
- **Reputational Damage**: Community questions Foundation's stability

**The Reality**:
- 25% of nonprofit EDs leave within 2 years
- 50% of EDs plan to leave within 5 years
- 60% of nonprofits have NO succession plan

**Foundation's Commitment**: Mark Egly Foundation will ALWAYS have a succession plan—updated annually, tested through scenarios, ready to execute within 24-48 hours.

---

### Types of Succession

**Emergency Succession** (Unplanned):
- ED death, serious illness, accident
- ED terminated for cause (misconduct, fraud)
- ED resigns immediately (no notice)
- **Timeline**: Immediate (acting ED appointed within 24-48 hours)

**Planned Succession** (Anticipated):
- ED announces retirement (6-12 months notice)
- ED promotion to another role (national organization recruits ED)
- ED sabbatical (3-6 months)
- **Timeline**: 6-18 months (structured search, transition planning)

**Developmental Succession** (Proactive):
- Identifying high-potential staff as future leaders
- Cross-training, mentoring, leadership development
- Building internal candidate pool
- **Timeline**: 2-5 years (ongoing talent cultivation)

---

## Executive Director Succession

### ED Role Criticality

**Why ED Succession is Most Critical**:
- ED is face of Foundation (donors, media, partners, patients)
- ED holds key relationships (top 20 donors, pharmaceutical partners, Board)
- ED makes strategic decisions (program priorities, budget allocation, advocacy)
- ED manages staff (morale, direction, accountability)
- ED legally authorized (signs contracts, represents 501(c)(3))

**ED Departure Impact** (without succession plan):
- **Immediate**: Staff uncertainty, donor anxiety, partner concerns
- **Short-term (3 months)**: Grant deadlines missed, event planning stalled, fundraising drops
- **Long-term (6-12 months)**: Strategic initiatives halted, talent loss, mission drift

**Succession Plan Purpose**: Minimize disruption, maintain stakeholder confidence, ensure continuity.

---

### ED Succession Plan Document

**Required Elements** (Board-approved, reviewed annually):

1. **Emergency Acting ED**: Name of person who immediately assumes ED role (typically COO or Board Chair)
2. **Delegation of Authority**: What Acting ED can/cannot do (spending limits, hiring, contracts)
3. **Communication Plan**: Who notifies staff, Board, donors, media, partners—and how
4. **Transition Timeline**: How long Acting ED serves (30-90 days while Board searches)
5. **Search Process**: Search committee composition, timeline, candidate criteria
6. **Key Relationships**: List of top 20 donors, partners ED manages (Acting ED contacts immediately)
7. **Critical Deadlines**: Grants, audits, events that can't be missed (Acting ED priorities)

**Document Location**: Sealed envelope in Board Chair's possession + digital copy (password-protected, Board Chair and Vice Chair access).

**Annual Review**: Every January, Board Executive Committee reviews plan—update Acting ED designation, contact lists, authorities.

---

## Emergency ED Succession

### Immediate Response Protocol (First 24-48 Hours)

**Hour 0: ED Unavailability Confirmed**

**Triggers**:
- Board Chair notified ED hospitalized, incapacitated
- ED terminates immediately (Board fires or ED resigns abruptly)
- ED death

**Board Chair Actions** (within 1 hour):
1. Confirm succession plan location, review Acting ED designation
2. Call emergency Board Executive Committee meeting (phone/Zoom, within 2-4 hours)
3. Notify Acting ED ("You are now Acting Executive Director effective immediately")

---

**Hours 1-4: Emergency Board Meeting**

**Agenda** (60 minutes):
1. **Confirm Situation** (5 min): What happened? How long is ED unavailable?
2. **Activate Succession Plan** (10 min): Appoint Acting ED, delegate authority
3. **Communication Strategy** (20 min): Draft staff announcement, donor talking points
4. **Operational Priorities** (15 min): Critical deadlines next 30 days (grants, payroll, events)
5. **Search Timeline** (10 min): When to start permanent search (if ED departure permanent)

**Board Vote**: "Resolved: Appoint [Name] as Acting Executive Director with authority to [specific powers], effective [date/time]."

---

**Hours 4-24: Staff & Stakeholder Notification**

**Staff Announcement** (Acting ED or Board Chair delivers):
> Team,
>
> I'm writing to inform you that [ED Name] is [unable to serve/has departed]. Effective immediately, [Acting ED Name] has been appointed Acting Executive Director.
>
> [Acting ED] has the full confidence of the Board and will ensure our programs and operations continue without interruption.
>
> We understand this news may raise questions. [Acting ED] will hold an all-staff meeting today at [TIME] to address concerns.
>
> Your professionalism and dedication during this transition are appreciated.

**Key Donor Calls** (Board Chair personally calls top 10 donors):
- "Wanted you to hear directly from me: [ED situation]. Board has acted decisively—[Acting ED] is leading Foundation. Your support is more critical than ever."

**Partner Notifications** (Acting ED emails):
- Pharmaceutical partners, academic collaborators, key vendors
- "Leadership transition, but partnerships continue—I'm your contact going forward."

---

**Days 2-7: Stabilization**

**Acting ED Priorities**:
1. **Staff Reassurance**: Daily updates, open door policy, visibility
2. **Donor Stewardship**: Thank-you calls, reassure no disruption
3. **Critical Deadlines**: Grant reports due, payroll processed, events confirmed
4. **Board Coordination**: Daily check-in with Board Chair (15 min)

**What Acting ED Should NOT Do** (without Board approval):
- Hire/fire staff (except emergency)
- Sign contracts >$25K
- Launch new programs
- Make strategic pivots

---

### Emergency Acting ED Designation

**Primary Acting ED**: Chief Operating Officer (COO)
- **Rationale**: COO knows operations, has staff relationships, can step in immediately
- **Authority**: Full ED powers except Board-level decisions (hiring executives, >$50K spending, strategic changes)
- **Compensation**: Acting ED receives 10-20% salary increase during tenure (incentive, recognition of added responsibility)

**Backup Acting ED** (if COO unavailable): Program Director or Development Director
- Selected based on tenure, competence, Board confidence

**Board Chair as Acting ED** (last resort, if no qualified staff):
- Board Chair temporarily assumes ED role (rare, only for tiny organizations or catastrophic staff loss)
- **Risk**: Board Chair has Board duties—dual role creates conflicts, unsustainable >30 days

---

### When Emergency Becomes Permanent

**Scenario**: ED dies, terminates for cause, or resigns with no return.

**Board Decision Timeline**:
- **Day 7**: Board decides whether to launch permanent search or extend Acting ED appointment
- **Day 30**: If searching, Search Committee formed, position posted
- **Day 90**: Finalists interviewed, offer made
- **Day 120-180**: New ED starts (typical search timeline)

**Acting ED Options**:
1. **Promote Acting ED to Permanent**: If Acting ED performs exceptionally, Board may offer permanent role (skip search)
   - **Pro**: Continuity, proven performance, fast
   - **Con**: Miss opportunity to find external "upgrade" candidate
2. **Continue Acting ED During Search**: Acting ED serves 3-6 months while Board searches
   - **Fair Practice**: Tell Acting ED whether they're in consideration for permanent role (don't string along)
3. **Interim ED Search**: Hire professional interim ED (nonprofit executive recruiter provides interim)
   - **Cost**: $10K-$20K/month, typically 6-12 month commitment

---

## Planned ED Succession

### ED Retirement Announcement

**Ideal Timeline**: ED gives 12 months notice (allows thoughtful search, transition planning).

**ED's Departure Letter to Board**:
> Dear Board,
>
> After [X] years of serving Mark Egly Foundation, I've decided to retire effective [Date, 12 months from now].
>
> This Foundation has been my life's work, and I'm committed to ensuring a smooth transition. I will work closely with the Board to:
> - Identify and onboard my successor
> - Document critical processes and relationships
> - Ensure financial stability and program continuity
>
> I'm grateful for the opportunity to advance the AATD mission, and I'm confident the Foundation's best years lie ahead.

---

### Planned Succession Timeline (12 Months)

**Months 1-3: Planning & Documentation**
- Board forms Search Committee (5-7 members: Board Chair, 2 Board members, 1 major donor, 1 staff representative, optional external advisor)
- ED documents:
  - Key donor relationships (top 50 donors—contact history, cultivation strategies)
  - Partnership agreements (pharma, academic—status, key contacts)
  - Strategic priorities (what's critical next 2 years)
  - Institutional knowledge (why we do things certain ways, historical context)
- Board approves ED position description (may update based on strategic needs)

**Months 4-6: Search & Recruitment**
- Position posted (Idealist, Chronicle of Philanthropy, nonprofit exec networks)
- Search firm engaged (if budget allows—$25K-$50K, accelerates search)
- Applications reviewed (Search Committee screens)
- First-round interviews (Zoom, 10-15 candidates)

**Months 7-9: Final Selection**
- Second-round interviews (in-person, 3-5 finalists)
- Reference checks (thorough—past employers, Board members, direct reports)
- Finalist meets full Board, staff, key donors
- Offer extended, negotiated, accepted

**Months 10-12: Transition**
- New ED starts (ideally 2-3 months before outgoing ED departs—overlap period)
- Departing ED introduces successor to donors, partners, funders
- New ED shadows, learns, asks questions
- Departing ED's final act: Farewell event (honor contributions, celebrate mission)

---

### Transition Period (2-3 Month Overlap)

**Overlap Benefits**:
- Relationship introductions (new ED meets donors with outgoing ED present—warm handoff)
- Institutional knowledge transfer (face-to-face, "here's how we do this and why")
- Staff confidence (seeing continuity, leadership alignment)

**Overlap Structure**:
- **Month 1**: Outgoing ED leads, new ED observes (Board meetings, donor meetings, staff meetings)
- **Month 2**: Co-leadership (outgoing ED and new ED jointly lead—transition visible)
- **Month 3**: New ED leads, outgoing ED available for questions (inverse roles)

**Departing ED's Final Responsibilities**:
- Complete annual audit (if transition during audit period)
- Close out major grants (or brief new ED on requirements)
- Document lessons learned (memo to new ED: "What I wish I'd known")

---

## Key Person Identification

### Critical Positions Matrix

**Definition**: Key person = if they leave, Foundation operations significantly disrupted (>30% productivity loss, critical knowledge lost).

| **Position**               | **Why Critical**                                      | **Succession Ready?** | **Cross-Trained?** | **Retention Risk** |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Executive Director**     | Strategic leadership, donor relationships, Board mgmt | Yes (plan exists)     | COO trained        | Low (happy, vested) |
| **Development Director**   | Major donor relationships, fundraising expertise      | Partial               | Grants Manager     | Medium (burnout)   |
| **Research Director**      | Scientific credibility, registry design, IRB          | No                    | None               | Low (passion project) |
| **Patient Services Director** | Patient trust, community relationships, support groups | Partial            | Patient Navigator  | Medium (emotional toll) |
| **Chief Operating Officer** | Operations, finance, HR, compliance                  | Yes (Acting ED)       | Accountant         | Low (well-paid)    |
| **IT Director**            | Systems, data security, patient portal                | No                    | External vendor    | High (job market hot) |

**Action Plan**: Board reviews annually—for any position marked "No" or "Partial," require succession plan within 90 days.

---

### Key Person Risk Mitigation

**Strategy 1: Cross-Training**
- Every key person trains 1-2 understudies (can perform 70-80% of role if key person absent)
- Example: Development Director trains Grants Manager on major donor cultivation
- **Investment**: 2-4 hours/month cross-training time

**Strategy 2: Documentation**
- Key person documents critical processes (SOPs, contact lists, decision rationale)
- Stored in accessible location (Google Drive, knowledge management system)
- Updated quarterly

**Strategy 3: Retention Incentives**
- Key people receive competitive compensation (75th percentile for market)
- Retention bonuses (if key person stays 3+ years, bonus equals 10-20% salary)
- Professional development (conferences, courses—keep skills sharp, show investment)

**Strategy 4: External Backup**
- For highly specialized roles (IT, legal), have external consultant on retainer
- Can step in temporarily if key person leaves

---

## Cross-Training Requirements

### Mandatory Cross-Training Pairs

**Finance/Accounting**:
- COO + External Accountant (if COO leaves, accountant can handle interim finance)
- Board Treasurer + COO (Treasurer can review financials independently)

**Fundraising**:
- Development Director + Grants Manager (can cover individual giving if Dev Dir leaves)
- ED + Development Director (ED can personally cultivate top donors if needed)

**Programs**:
- Program Director + Program Manager (Manager can run programs if Director leaves)
- Patient Services Director + Senior Patient Navigator (continuity of patient support)

**Operations**:
- COO + Executive Assistant (EA knows operational details, can brief new COO)
- IT Director + External IT Vendor (vendor can maintain systems if IT Dir leaves)

---

### Cross-Training Process

**Quarterly Cross-Training Sessions** (2 hours per quarter):
- Key person teaches understudy: "Here's what I do, here's how, here's why"
- Understudy practices (shadowing, doing task with oversight)
- Documentation updated (SOPs revised based on session)

**Annual Role Swap** (1 week):
- Key person takes vacation, understudy performs role independently
- Tests readiness, identifies gaps
- Key person writes feedback: "Understudy is 80% ready, needs more training on X"

---

## Emergency Delegation of Authority

### Emergency Powers Matrix

**Scenario**: Executive Director suddenly unavailable, Acting ED must make decisions immediately.

| **Decision Type**              | **ED Authority**     | **Acting ED Authority** | **Board Chair Authority** |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Day-to-day operations**      | Full authority       | Full authority          | None (operational)        |
| **Spending <$5K**              | ED approval          | Acting ED approval      | None                      |
| **Spending $5K-$25K**          | ED + Treasurer       | Acting ED + Board Chair | Board Chair approval      |
| **Spending >$25K**             | Board vote           | Board vote              | Emergency: Chair + Vice   |
| **Hire/fire non-key staff**    | ED                   | Acting ED (with Chair)  | Board approval            |
| **Hire/fire key staff**        | ED + Board           | Board only              | Board Executive Committee |
| **Sign contracts <$25K**       | ED                   | Acting ED               | None                      |
| **Sign contracts >$25K**       | ED + Board approval  | Board approval          | Emergency: Executive Cmte |
| **Media statements**           | ED                   | Acting ED + Board Chair | Board Chair (if ED crisis)|
| **Strategic decisions**        | ED proposes, Board decides | Board decides      | Board vote                |

**Emergency Provision**: Board Chair + Vice Chair can authorize decisions requiring Board vote if emergency prevents Board meeting (ratified at next meeting).

---

## Board Continuity & Leadership Pipeline

### Board Succession Planning

**Why Critical**: Board provides governance, oversight, fundraising. Board dysfunction during leadership transition amplifies crisis.

**Board Term Limits**:
- Board members serve 3-year terms, max 3 consecutive terms (9 years)
- Ensures natural turnover, prevents entrenchment
- Forces pipeline development (always recruiting next Board class)

---

### Board Leadership Pipeline

**Officer Succession Pathway**:
1. **Year 1-2**: New Board member (learning, participating)
2. **Year 2-4**: Committee member (Finance, Development, Governance)
3. **Year 4-6**: Committee Chair (leadership experience)
4. **Year 6-8**: Officer (Secretary, Treasurer, Vice Chair)
5. **Year 8-9**: Board Chair (if elected)

**Benefit**: Every Board Chair has 6-8 years Board experience before leading—prepared, credible, confident.

---

### Board Recruitment Strategy

**Annual Recruitment** (Board Development Committee):
- Identify gaps (skills, demographics, fundraising capacity)
- Recruit 2-3 new Board members annually (replacing term-limited members)
- Prospect list: 10-15 candidates identified 12 months before need

**Board Candidate Criteria**:
- **Give/Get**: Able to personally donate $10K-$25K/year OR raise $25K-$50K/year
- **Expertise**: Skills Foundation needs (finance, legal, healthcare, marketing, patient perspective)
- **Passion**: Personal connection to AATD (diagnosed, family member, mission-driven)
- **Time**: Attend 10-12 Board meetings/year + committee work (50-100 hours/year)

---

### Board Chair Succession

**Planned Transition**:
- Board Chair announces 12 months before term ends (allows Vice Chair to prepare)
- Vice Chair shadows Chair (attends donor meetings, learns Board leadership)
- Governance Committee confirms Vice Chair ready or identifies alternative candidate
- Board votes to elect Vice Chair to Chair (or competitive election if multiple candidates)

**Emergency Transition**:
- If Board Chair suddenly unavailable (death, illness, resignation), Vice Chair immediately assumes Chair role
- Board votes at next meeting to confirm permanent Chair or elect alternative

---

## Knowledge Documentation

### Institutional Memory Preservation

**Problem**: When key people leave, critical knowledge leaves with them ("Why did we stop that partnership?" "Who's our contact at NIH?").

**Solution**: Document everything.

---

### Knowledge Management System

**Platform**: Google Drive, SharePoint, or Notion (centralized, searchable, accessible).

**Required Documentation** (by department):

**Executive/Board**:
- Board meeting minutes (all years)
- Strategic plans (historical—why strategies changed)
- Major decisions rationale ("Why we hired this vendor," "Why we ended that program")
- Key relationships (donors, partners—contact history, preferences)

**Development/Fundraising**:
- Donor database (CRM—Salesforce, Bloomerang, DonorPerfect)
- Major donor profiles (wealth, interests, giving history, cultivation notes)
- Grant files (proposals, reports, funder feedback)
- Fundraising event playbooks (gala checklist, vendor contacts, timeline)

**Programs**:
- Program SOPs (how to run support groups, patient navigation process)
- Patient registry protocols (enrollment, data collection, IRB approvals)
- Partnership agreements (pharma, academic—terms, key contacts)
- Research protocols (IRB submissions, data management plans)

**Finance/Operations**:
- Financial policies (approval workflows, spending limits)
- Vendor contracts (IT, legal, accounting—terms, contacts)
- Insurance policies (carrier, coverage, renewal dates)
- Audit files (past audits, management letters, corrective actions)

---

### Departing Employee Knowledge Transfer

**Exit Interview Process** (2-4 weeks before departure):
- Manager conducts exit interview: "What should your successor know?"
- Employee documents:
  - Key contacts (names, relationships, context)
  - Ongoing projects (status, next steps, deadlines)
  - Processes (undocumented procedures, "tribal knowledge")
  - Lessons learned (what worked, what didn't, recommendations)
- Files organized, saved in shared drive (not employee's personal drive)

**Transition Period**: If possible, 2-week overlap with replacement (departing employee trains successor).

---

## Talent Pipeline Development

### Internal Promotion Pathways

**Philosophy**: Promote from within when possible—rewards loyalty, retains knowledge, boosts morale.

**Career Ladder Examples**:

**Development Track**:
- Development Associate → Grants Manager → Development Director → COO or ED

**Programs Track**:
- Patient Navigator → Patient Services Manager → Patient Services Director → ED

**Operations Track**:
- Executive Assistant → Operations Manager → COO → ED

**Advancement Criteria**:
- 2+ years in current role
- Exceeds performance expectations
- Demonstrates leadership potential (manages projects, mentors colleagues)
- Pursues professional development (courses, certifications, conferences)

---

### Leadership Development Program (Year 3+)

**Purpose**: Prepare high-potential staff for future leadership roles.

**Program Structure** (1-year cohort):
- Select 3-5 staff annually (nominated by managers, approved by ED)
- Monthly leadership training (topics: strategic thinking, financial management, Board relations, fundraising)
- Executive coaching (external coach, 4 sessions/year)
- Shadowing opportunities (attend Board meetings, donor meetings, strategic planning)
- Capstone project (lead strategic initiative, present to Board)

**Cost**: $5,000-$10,000/year (coaching, training materials, staff time).

**Outcome**: 50% of program graduates promoted within 2 years (internal succession bench).

---

## Interim Leadership Protocols

### Interim Executive Director

**When to Hire Interim ED** (vs. promoting Acting ED):
- No qualified internal candidate
- Board wants external perspective during turmoil
- Permanent search will take 6-12 months (too long for Acting ED)

**Interim ED Profile**:
- Experienced nonprofit executive (previous ED roles)
- Available immediately, comfortable with temporary role
- Strong operations/crisis management skills (not strategic visionary—that's permanent ED's job)

**Where to Find**:
- Interim executive placement firms (Bridgespan, CompassPoint, Third Sector)
- Retired nonprofit executives (looking for bridge work)
- Executive transition consultants

**Compensation**: $8,000-$15,000/month (contractor, not employee) for 6-12 months.

---

### Interim Leadership Scope

**What Interim ED Should Do**:
- Stabilize operations (keep programs running, staff supported)
- Manage critical deadlines (grants, audit, events)
- Maintain donor/partner relationships (reassure continuity)
- Support permanent ED search (provide organizational insights to Search Committee)

**What Interim ED Should NOT Do**:
- Launch major strategic initiatives (that's permanent ED's role)
- Hire/fire key staff (wait for permanent ED unless emergency)
- Make long-term commitments (contracts >1 year)

**Transition Out**: Interim ED stays through permanent ED's first 30 days (briefing, introductions), then exits.

---

## Executive Search Process

### Search Committee Composition

**Size**: 5-7 members (odd number for tie-breaking votes).

**Composition**:
- Board Chair (leads committee)
- 2 Board members (diverse perspectives—finance + programs, or patient + funder)
- 1 major donor (represents donor community)
- 1 staff representative (employee voice, chosen by staff vote or ED appointment)
- Optional: External advisor (nonprofit consultant, retired ED with search experience)

**Staff Representative Considerations**:
- Represents staff interests (who will we want to work for?)
- Confidentiality critical (can't gossip about candidates)
- Non-voting in some models (input but not decision authority)

---

### Candidate Profile Development

**Board Develops "Must-Haves" vs. "Nice-to-Haves"**:

**Must-Haves**:
- 5+ years nonprofit leadership (preferably ED role)
- Fundraising experience (proven track record raising $500K-$1M+/year)
- Healthcare/patient advocacy background (understands AATD or similar communities)
- Strategic thinking (can articulate vision, make decisions)
- Board management (comfortable with governance, fiduciary oversight)

**Nice-to-Haves**:
- AATD personal connection (patient, family member, caregiver)
- Research background (understands patient registries, IRBs)
- Ohio ties (local networks, don't need relocation)
- Bilingual Spanish (if serving Hispanic AATD patients)

**Compensation Range**: Based on budget, market rates, outgoing ED's salary (typically $80K-$150K for small-to-midsize health advocacy nonprofit).

---

### Search Firm vs. DIY Search

**Use Search Firm When**:
- Budget allows ($25K-$50K for firm)
- Board lacks search expertise
- Need national candidate pool (firm has networks)
- High-stakes search (large budget, complex organization)

**DIY Search When**:
- Budget constrained (<$500K operating budget)
- Board has HR/recruitment expertise
- Strong applicant pool expected (mission attracts candidates)
- Timeline flexible (DIY takes longer—4-6 months vs. 3-4 months with firm)

**Hybrid Approach**: Post position widely (Idealist, Chronicle of Philanthropy, LinkedIn), use consultant for finalist interviews/reference checks only ($5K-$10K).

---

### Interview Process

**Stage 1: Application Review**
- 50-100 applications typical
- Search Committee screens to 15-20 for phone interviews

**Stage 2: Phone Interviews** (30 min each)
- Structured questions (same for all candidates)
- Narrow to 5-7 for in-depth interviews

**Stage 3: In-Depth Interviews** (90 min each, Zoom or in-person)
- Panel interview (Search Committee)
- Case study (candidate presents how they'd address Foundation challenge)
- Narrow to 2-3 finalists

**Stage 4: Finalist Interviews** (half-day on-site)
- Meet full Board (working lunch)
- Meet staff (town hall Q&A)
- Tour facilities, meet patients/donors (if appropriate)
- Reference checks (3-5 references, including Board Chair of previous org)

**Stage 5: Offer**
- Search Committee recommends finalist to Board
- Board votes to extend offer
- Board Chair negotiates salary, start date, terms

---

## Onboarding for Successor Executives

### First 90 Days Plan

**Days 1-30: Listen & Learn**

**Priorities**:
- Meet every staff member (1-on-1, 30 min each)
- Meet every Board member (1-on-1, calls or coffee)
- Review financial statements (past 3 years, current budget)
- Read strategic plan, past Board minutes, audit reports
- Attend programs (support group, patient conference, fundraising event)

**Deliverable**: New ED presents "What I'm Learning" to Board (30-day report).

---

**Days 31-60: Assess & Prioritize**

**Priorities**:
- Identify strengths (what's working well?)
- Identify gaps (what needs attention?)
- Meet top 20 donors (cultivation calls, thank yous)
- Meet key partners (pharma, academic, funders)
- Develop 100-day priorities (3-5 quick wins)

**Deliverable**: 60-day plan to Board (priorities for next 30 days).

---

**Days 61-90: Act & Deliver**

**Priorities**:
- Execute quick wins (visible progress, build credibility)
- Staff reorganization (if needed—but move carefully)
- Board committee participation (attend Finance, Development meetings)
- Strategic planning (if not recent, initiate planning process)

**Deliverable**: 90-day review with Board (accomplishments, challenges, Year 1 goals).

---

### Onboarding Support

**Board Mentor**: Assign experienced Board member as new ED's mentor (monthly check-ins, advice, sounding board).

**Peer Network**: Connect new ED with peer EDs (other health advocacy nonprofits—share lessons, avoid pitfalls).

**Executive Coach** (Year 1): Provide external coach for new ED ($3,000-$8,000/year, 6-12 sessions)—confidential support, leadership development.

---

## Retention Strategies

### Why Key People Leave

**Exit Interview Data** (nonprofit sector):
- 40%: Compensation (underpaid vs. market, can't afford cost of living)
- 30%: Career advancement (no growth opportunity, hit ceiling)
- 20%: Organizational culture (toxic Board, unsupportive colleagues, mission drift)
- 10%: Burnout (overwork, emotional toll, work-life imbalance)

**Foundation's Strategy**: Address all four drivers proactively.

---

### Retention Strategy 1: Competitive Compensation

**Salary Philosophy**:
- Benchmark salaries annually (GuideStar, Nonprofit Times salary survey, local data)
- Target 50th-75th percentile for market (competitive but not excessive)

- Appreciated (regular thank yous, recognition)

**Recognition Programs**:
- Employee of the Quarter (peer-nominated, $500 bonus or extra PTO day)

### Retention Strategy 4: Work-Life Balance

**Flexible Work**:

- Flexible hours (core hours 10am-3pm, flex start/end)
- Compressed workweeks (4-day weeks if role allows)

**PTO Encouragement**:
- Use-it-or-lose-it policy (forces staff to take vacation—prevents burnout)
- Sabbaticals (after 7 years, 4-week paid sabbatical)

**Burnout Prevention**:

## Conclusion

### Succession Planning = Mission Insurance

**Board's Fiduciary Duty**: Ensure Foundation can fulfill mission even during leadership transitions. Succession planning is governance, not optional.

**Investment**: $15K-$30K/year prevents $500K+ losses (donor attrition, program disruption, talent exodus).

**Annual Review**: Board reviews succession plan every January—update names, authorities, strategies.
