## Executive Summary

The Mark Egly Foundation's Patient Safety Protocols establish comprehensive procedures to protect the wellbeing of all individuals participating in Foundation programs, research studies, and services. While the Foundation is not a healthcare provider and does not diagnose or treat Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, we interact with a vulnerable patient population and have a duty to ensure their safety in all Foundation activities.

**Patient Safety Commitment:**

> **"Every patient who trusts the Mark Egly Foundation with their information, participation, or engagement deserves the highest standard of safety, respect, and care. Patient safety is not negotiable—it is our foundational obligation."**

**Core Safety Principles:**

1. **Do No Harm**: Foundation activities must not cause physical, psychological, or social harm to patients
2. **Patient-Centered**: Safety protocols designed with patient needs and perspectives central
3. **Proactive Prevention**: Identify and mitigate risks before incidents occur
4. **Transparent Reporting**: Encourage open reporting of safety concerns without fear of retaliation
5. **Continuous Learning**: Every incident is an opportunity to improve systems and prevent recurrence
6. **Just Culture**: Focus on system failures, not individual blame (except in cases of willful negligence or malicious conduct)

**Foundation's Safety Obligations:**

Since the Foundation is not a clinical entity, our safety protocols focus on:

- **Registry Participation Safety**: Protecting participants from data breaches, psychological harm from surveys, or coercion
- **Research Safety**: Ensuring Foundation-funded research protects human subjects per IRB standards
- **Event Safety**: Preventing physical injuries at Foundation events (conferences, walks, support groups)
- **Information Safety**: Providing accurate health information; clearly disclaiming we don't provide medical advice
- **Referral Safety**: Connecting patients to qualified, safe healthcare providers

**Patient Safety Metrics:**

| **Metric**                           | **Target**          | **Measurement**           |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Serious Adverse Events**           | 0 per year          | Incident reports          |
| **Patient Complaints Resolved**      | 100% within 30 days | Complaint tracking system |
| **Informed Consent Compliance**      | 100%                | Consent audit             |
| **Safety Incidents Investigated**    | 100% within 7 days  | Incident log              |
| **Staff Safety Training Completion** | 100% annually       | Training records          |

## Patient Safety Philosophy

### Patient-First Approach

**Defining "Patient" in Foundation Context:**

For purposes of these protocols, "patient" includes:

- Registry participants
- Event attendees (conferences, support groups, fundraising events)
- Information seekers (website visitors, helpline callers)
- Research study participants (in Foundation-funded studies)
- Patients referred to Foundation by healthcare providers
- Family members and caregivers of patients with Alpha-1

### Safety Culture

**Foundation Commitment to Safety Culture:**

1. **Leadership Commitment**: Executive Director and Board champion patient safety
2. **Open Communication**: Staff encouraged to report safety concerns to leadership
3. **Non-Punitive Environment**: Staff reporting safety issues are protected (except willful violations)
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular safety audits, incident reviews, system refinements
5. **Resource Allocation**: Budget includes safety measures (insurance, training, systems)

**Monthly Safety Huddle**: 30-minute staff meeting to discuss:

- Recent safety incidents (de-identified)
- Near misses (incidents that could have caused harm but didn't)
- Safety concerns raised by staff or patients
- Lessons learned from other organizations
- Proactive safety improvements

## Patient Complaint Procedures

### Definition of Complaint

**Complaint**: Expression of dissatisfaction with Foundation service, program, staff behavior, or policies.

**Complaints vs. Adverse Events:**

- **Complaint**: Patient upset about delayed response to registry question → Complaint
- **Adverse Event**: Registry survey causes severe panic attack → Adverse Event

Some incidents may be both (e.g., patient injured at event AND complains about unsafe conditions → Both AE and Complaint).

### Complaint Process

**Step 1: Receipt of Complaint**

Complaints may be submitted via:

- Phone: (555) 123-4567 (COO's line)
- Email: complaints@markegly.org
- Mail: Mark Egly Foundation, Attn: COO, [Address]
- Online form: Website complaint form
- In-person: To any staff member (who logs complaint)

**Step 2: Acknowledgment**

- Within 1 business day, Foundation acknowledges receipt of complaint
- Provide complaint reference number
- Explain complaint resolution process and timeline

**Step 3: Investigation**

- COO or designee investigates complaint
- Interview complainant, staff involved, witnesses
- Review relevant documents, policies, communications
- Timeline: Simple complaints resolved in 1 week; complex complaints within 30 days

**Step 4: Resolution**

- Determine findings (complaint substantiated, unsubstantiated, or partially substantiated)
- Identify corrective actions if complaint valid
- Communicate resolution to complainant in writing

**Step 5: Follow-Up**

- 2 weeks after resolution, contact complainant to ensure satisfaction
- If complainant remains unsatisfied, escalate to ED or Board

**Example Complaint Resolution:**

**Complaint**: Patient complains registry survey is too long and burdensome.

- **Investigation**: Review survey (50 questions, 45 minutes); compare to peer registries; survey Patient Advisory Board
- **Findings**: Survey length is longer than average; several questions rated "low priority" by researchers
- **Corrective Action**: Shorten survey to 30 questions (30 minutes); pilot test with 50 participants; if completion rate improves, implement permanently
- **Communication**: Thank patient for feedback; explain survey revision underway; invite patient to test shorter version
- **Follow-Up**: 2 weeks later, confirm patient satisfied with response

### Escalation

**When to Escalate:**

- Complaint involves serious safety issue
- Complaint alleges discrimination, harassment, or illegal conduct
- Complainant dissatisfied with initial resolution
- Complaint involves ED or Board member

**Escalation Path**:

1. Initial complaint → COO
2. Escalation → ED
3. Further escalation → Board Chair or Risk Committee
4. External: Complainant may file complaint with regulatory bodies (if applicable) or pursue legal action

## Safety Incident Investigation

### Investigation Triggers

**All adverse events are investigated.** Scope and depth of investigation varies by severity:

- **Serious Incidents**: Comprehensive investigation with root cause analysis (RCA)
- **Moderate Incidents**: Standard investigation
- **Minor Incidents**: Brief review

### Investigation Process

**Step 1: Immediate Response (Day 0)**

- Ensure patient safety (provide medical care, remove hazard)
- Preserve evidence (equipment involved, photos, documents)
- Notify leadership (COO, ED for serious incidents)
- Secure incident scene if necessary

**Step 2: Assign Investigator (Day 1)**

- **Serious Incidents**: COO leads investigation; may engage external consultant
- **Moderate/Minor Incidents**: Assigned to appropriate manager (Registry Manager for registry incidents, Program Manager for event incidents)

**Step 3: Data Collection (Days 2-7)**

- Interview involved parties and witnesses
- Review relevant policies, procedures, training records
- Examine physical evidence (equipment, facility conditions)
- Review similar past incidents

**Step 4: Analysis (Days 7-14)**

- Determine sequence of events (timeline)
- Identify immediate causes (what directly caused incident)
- Identify contributing factors (latent system weaknesses)
- Assess whether current policies/procedures were followed
- If yes, question whether policies are adequate
- If no, question why not (training gap, unclear policy, intentional violation)

**Step 5: Report (Day 14)**

- Complete Incident Investigation Report documenting findings
- Recommend corrective actions (see CAPA section)
- Present to Patient Safety Committee

**Step 6: Notification (Day 15)**

- Notify affected individuals of findings and actions (balancing transparency with legal considerations; consult counsel for serious incidents)
- Report to external bodies if required (see Reporting to External Bodies)

### Investigation Documentation

**Incident Investigation Report Template:**

1. **Incident Summary**: Brief overview (date, location, individuals, outcome)
2. **Background**: Context (program, activity, participants' condition)
3. **Sequence of Events**: Detailed timeline
4. **Analysis**: Immediate causes, contributing factors, root causes
5. **Policy/Procedure Compliance**: Were protocols followed?
6. **Similar Incidents**: Past incidents of same type; patterns identified
7. **Findings**: Conclusions about what happened and why
8. **Recommendations**: Proposed corrective and preventive actions
9. **Attachments**: Incident report, witness statements, photos, policies

**Confidentiality**: Investigation reports contain sensitive information; marked confidential; limited distribution (COO, ED, Medical Director, legal counsel, Patient Safety Committee).

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### When to Conduct RCA

**Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** is comprehensive investigation method used for **serious incidents** where understanding underlying system failures is critical to prevention.

**RCA Triggers:**

- Serious adverse event (death, life-threatening injury, major privacy breach)
- Recurring incidents of same type (pattern indicates system problem)
- Near miss with high potential for serious harm
- Board or regulatory body requests RCA

### RCA Methodology

**RCA Team**:

- **Facilitator**: COO or external RCA expert
- **Subject Matter Experts**: Staff with expertise in affected program area
- **Medical Director** (if clinical aspects involved)
- **Patient Representative** (optional; provides patient perspective)

**RCA Process** (5 Whys + Fishbone Diagram):

**Step 1: Define the Problem**

Clearly state what happened, when, where, who was affected.

**Example**: "On [Date], registry participant experienced severe anxiety attack after receiving email reminder about medical history survey."

**Step 2: Gather Data**

Collect all facts about incident (see Investigation Process).

**Step 3: Identify Contributing Factors (Fishbone Diagram)**

Brainstorm all factors that contributed, organized by category:

- **People**: Staff training, fatigue, staffing levels
- **Processes**: Policies, procedures, workflows
- **Technology**: System failures, software bugs, equipment malfunctions
- **Environment**: Physical space, lighting, noise, weather
- **Communication**: Unclear instructions, language barriers, missing information

**Step 4: Identify Root Causes (5 Whys)**

For each contributing factor, ask "Why?" repeatedly until reaching root cause.

**Example**:

- **Problem**: Participant had severe anxiety after survey reminder
- **Why?** → Survey included triggering questions about disease prognosis without mental health resources
- **Why?** → Survey design didn't consider psychological impact
- **Why?** → No mental health professional consulted during survey development
- **Why?** → Foundation lacked protocol for reviewing surveys for psychological safety
- **Root Cause**: No policy requiring mental health review of participant-facing materials

**Step 5: Develop Solutions**

For each root cause, design corrective actions (see CAPA section).

**Step 6: Implement and Monitor**

Execute corrective actions; monitor effectiveness; adjust as needed.

**RCA Report**: Document entire RCA process; present to Board; maintain for accreditation or regulatory purposes.

---

## Corrective and Preventive Actions

### CAPA Framework

**Corrective Action (CA)**: Addresses immediate cause of incident; fixes the problem that occurred.

**Preventive Action (PA)**: Addresses root cause; prevents similar incidents in future.

**Example**:

- **Incident**: Participant trips on electrical cord at Foundation event; sprains ankle
- **Corrective Action**: Call 911; provide first aid; cover medical expenses
- **Preventive Action**: Implement policy requiring all cords taped down or covered; conduct venue safety inspections before all events; train event staff on hazard identification

### CAPA Development

**Action Plan Template:**

| **Action**                                       | **Responsibility** | **Timeline** | **Resources Needed**                                    | **Success Metric**                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Revise survey to include mental health resources | Registry Manager   | 30 days      | Mental health consultant ($2K), survey platform updates | Revised survey reviewed by MH professional; no complaints |
| Train staff on identifying triggering content    | COO                | 60 days      | Training materials, 2-hour training session             | 100% staff complete training; pass quiz                   |
| Implement pre-launch safety review checklist     | COO                | 90 days      | Develop checklist, integrate into procedures            | All new materials reviewed per checklist                  |

**CAPA Tracking**: Maintain CAPA log tracking all open and completed actions; review quarterly at Patient Safety Committee.

### Effectiveness Monitoring

**After implementing CAPA, monitor:**

- **Incident Recurrence**: Has same type of incident occurred again?
- **Near Misses**: Are there near misses indicating residual risk?
- **Process Metrics**: Are safety checklists being completed? Training attendance?
- **Staff Feedback**: Do staff find new procedures effective and workable?

**If CAPA Ineffective**: Reconvene RCA team; revise actions; implement additional measures.

## Safety Incident Classification

### Severity Classification

**Level 1: Minor Incident**

- **Definition**: No harm or minimal harm; no medical treatment required; brief psychological distress
- **Examples**: Patient receives duplicate survey reminder (annoyance); minor scrape at event (Band-Aid applied)
- **Response**: Brief review; simple corrective action; log incident

**Level 2: Moderate Incident**

- **Definition**: Temporary harm requiring medical treatment; moderate psychological distress; limited privacy breach
- **Examples**: Patient requires urgent care for injury at event; survey causes significant emotional upset requiring follow-up support; accidental disclosure of patient's Alpha-1 status to one unauthorized person
- **Response**: Standard investigation; corrective actions; notify Patient Safety Committee; may report to external bodies

**Level 3: Serious Incident**

- **Definition**: Permanent harm or life-threatening event; major privacy breach; significant psychological trauma
- **Examples**: Patient hospitalized due to event injury; data breach exposing hundreds of patients' PHI; research subject experiences serious adverse event possibly related to study
- **Response**: Immediate notification to COO, ED, Board Chair; comprehensive RCA; extensive CAPA; report to external bodies (IRB, OCR, authorities); consider suspension of affected program pending investigation

**Level 4: Catastrophic Incident**

- **Definition**: Death or multiple serious injuries; widespread privacy breach; criminal activity
- **Examples**: Patient death at Foundation event; massive cyberattack compromising entire registry; allegations of research misconduct causing harm
- **Response**: Immediate crisis management; engage legal counsel; external investigation; report to all relevant authorities; Board emergency meeting; public communication plan; potential operational suspension

**Reclassification**: Initial severity assessment may be revised as more information emerges.

## Reporting to External Bodies

### IRB Reporting

**If Foundation Research Involves IRB-Approved Studies:**

**Unanticipated Problems (UPs) and Adverse Events (AEs):**

- Principal Investigator (grantee) reports AEs to their IRB per protocol
- Foundation requires grantees to notify Foundation of serious AEs within 48 hours
- Foundation reports to Foundation's IRB (if applicable) or Board

**Reporting Timeline:**

- **Serious AEs**: Within 24-48 hours to IRB
- **Non-Serious AEs**: Aggregate reporting at continuing review (annually)

### HIPAA Breach Notification (OCR)

**If Privacy/Security Breach of PHI:**

Per Breach Notification Rule:

- **<500 Individuals Affected**: Report to OCR annually (within 60 days of year-end)
- **≥500 Individuals Affected**: Report to OCR within 60 days of discovery; also notify media

(See HIPAA Implementation Playbook for detailed breach notification procedures.)

### State Health Departments

**If Research-Related Adverse Event:**

Some states require reporting of serious adverse events in research studies. Check state laws where research conducted.

### Law Enforcement

**If Incident Involves Crime:**

Report to police:

- Assault, battery, theft at Foundation event
- Suspected child abuse or neglect (mandatory reporting by some staff)
- Cyberattack or hacking
- Fraud or embezzlement

## Communication and Transparency

### Communicating with Affected Patients

**After Incident Occurs:**

**Immediate Communication** (within 24 hours for serious incidents):

- Express concern for patient's wellbeing
- Explain what happened (factual, no speculation on causes yet)
- Describe immediate actions taken
- Provide contact information for follow-up
- Offer support (cover medical expenses if appropriate, counseling resources)

**Follow-Up Communication** (after investigation complete):

- Share investigation findings (at appropriate level of detail)
- Explain corrective actions implemented
- Apologize if Foundation at fault
- Reassure patient of commitment to safety

**Legal Considerations**: For serious incidents, consult legal counsel before communicating details; balance transparency with legal risk. Avoid admitting liability prematurely but express empathy.

### Public Reporting

**Annual Patient Safety Report** (published on website):

- Aggregate incident statistics (number and types; no patient identifiers)
- Safety improvements implemented
- Safety metrics and trends
- Demonstrates Foundation's commitment to transparency

**Example Content**:

> In 2024, the Mark Egly Foundation received 23 patient safety reports: 18 minor incidents, 4 moderate incidents, 1 serious incident, and 0 catastrophic incidents. The serious incident involved a temporary data access issue that was immediately resolved; no patient data was compromised. All incidents were investigated, and corrective actions were implemented. Key improvements included enhanced event safety protocols and expanded staff training.

## Special Populations

### Vulnerable Populations

**Pediatric Patients (<18 years):**

- **Consent**: Parental/guardian consent required; child assent obtained when developmentally appropriate (typically age 7+)
- **Communication**: Age-appropriate language; involve child in discussions per maturity level
- **Safety**: Enhanced protection; special attention to privacy (minimize peer awareness at events if child prefers)

**Patients with Cognitive Impairments:**

- **Consent**: Assess capacity to consent; if lacks capacity, obtain consent from legally authorized representative (LAR)
- **Communication**: Simple language; repeated explanations; verify understanding
- **Safety**: Additional supervision at events; check-in procedures

**Non-English Speakers:**

- **Consent**: Provide consent forms in patient's language; use professional interpreters (not family members) for consent discussions
- **Communication**: Translation services for registry surveys, event materials
- **Safety**: Ensure emergency communications accessible (multilingual signage, interpreter availability)

**Patients with Severe Disease/Frailty:**

- **Event Accommodations**: Accessible venues; rest areas; medical staff on-site for large events
- **Registry Surveys**: Shorter surveys; phone or proxy completion options if patient too ill to complete independently
- **Communication**: Sensitive to emotional state; avoid overly burdensome requests

## Emergency Response Protocols

### Medical Emergencies at Foundation Events

**Event Emergency Action Plan (EAP)** (required for all in-person events >25 attendees):

**Pre-Event Planning:**

1. **Venue Assessment**: Identify nearest hospital, emergency exits, AED location
2. **Emergency Contacts**: Compile list (911, venue security, local hospital, poison control)
3. **Medical Staff**: For events >100 attendees, consider on-site EMT or nurse
4. **First Aid Kit**: Ensure stocked kit available; check expiration dates
5. **Communication Plan**: How to alert staff of emergency (radios, mobile phones)

**During Event:**

**Medical Emergency Response Steps:**

1. **Recognize Emergency**: Staff identifies person in distress
2. **Call for Help**: Designate one person to call 911; provide exact location, nature of emergency
3. **Provide Care**: If trained, provide first aid/CPR until EMS arrives; if not trained, stay with person and offer reassurance
4. **Crowd Control**: Keep area clear for emergency responders
5. **Document**: After emergency resolved, complete incident report

**Emergency Scenarios and Responses:**

| **Scenario**                 | **Response**                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cardiac Arrest**           | Call 911; start CPR if trained; use AED if available                                                                      |
| **Severe Allergic Reaction** | Call 911; if patient has EpiPen, assist with administration; monitor vital signs                                          |
| **Fall with Injury**         | Don't move patient unless unsafe to remain; call 911 if serious injury suspected; provide first aid for bleeding          |
| **Diabetic Emergency**       | If conscious and patient identifies hypoglycemia, provide sugar source (juice, candy); if unconscious, call 911           |
| **Asthma Attack**            | Help patient use inhaler if they have one; call 911 if severe or not improving                                            |
| **Seizure**                  | Protect from injury (clear area, cushion head); don't restrain; call 911 if >5 minutes, first seizure, or patient injured |

**Post-Emergency:**

- Notify patient's emergency contact (if provided)
- Document incident thoroughly
- Debrief with staff; identify any issues with response
- Follow up with affected patient

### Non-Medical Emergencies
