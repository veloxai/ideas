## Grant Management Philosophy

### Foundation's Grant Strategy

**Mission-Driven Funding**: Pursue grants that advance AATD patient advocacy, research, education, or support—never chase money that diverts from mission.

**Diversified Portfolio**: Balance grant types:
- **Foundation grants** (30-40%): Private foundations, family foundations
- **Corporate grants** (20-30%): Pharmaceutical companies, healthcare corporations
- **Government grants** (20-30%): NIH, CDC, HRSA, state health departments
- **Individual major gifts** (10-20%): High-net-worth donors making 5-6 figure gifts

**Sustainability Focus**: Avoid over-reliance on single funder (no funder >25% of budget—reduces risk if they exit).

**Capacity Matching**: Only apply for grants Foundation can successfully execute (don't overcommit, underdeliver).

**Long-Term Relationships**: Treat grant as beginning of relationship, not transaction—multi-year support, partnerships, advocacy allies.

---

### Grant Lifecycle Stages

**7 Stages** (each covered in detail below):

1. **Prospecting** (3-6 months): Identify potential funders, research fit
2. **Cultivation** (1-3 months): Build relationships, educate funders about AATD
3. **Proposal Development** (1-2 months): Write LOI or full proposal
4. **Submission** (1 day): Submit on time, confirm receipt
5. **Award & Negotiation** (1-3 months): Review terms, negotiate if needed, accept
6. **Performance** (1-3 years): Execute program, report progress, manage budget
7. **Closeout** (1-2 months): Final reports, financial reconciliation, stewardship

**Total Timeline**: 6 months (prospecting) → 3 years (multi-year grant) → 2 months (closeout) = **~4 years per grant cycle**.

---

## Grant Prospecting & Opportunity Identification

### Prospecting Strategy

**Annual Goal** (Year 1): Identify 50-100 potential funders, apply to 20-30, win 8-12 (40% success rate typical for established nonprofits).

**Where to Find Opportunities**:

**1. Foundation Directories**:
- **Foundation Directory Online** (Candid/GuideStar): $1,000-$2,500/year, 140,000+ foundations
- **GrantStation**: $600-$1,200/year, curated opportunities by state/issue area
- **Instrumentl**: $1,500-$3,000/year, AI-powered funder matching

**2. Corporate Giving Programs**:
- Pharmaceutical companies (Grifols, CSL Behring, Takeda—all have AATD therapies)
- Healthcare companies (CVS Health Foundation, Walgreens, UnitedHealth Group)
- General corporate foundations (search "corporate foundations rare disease")

**3. Government Grants**:
- **Grants.gov**: Federal grant opportunities (free)
- **CDC Funding Opportunities**: Public health grants
- **NIH Reporter**: Track NIH-funded AATD research (partner opportunities)
- **State health departments**: Chronic disease programs, patient navigation

**4. Community Foundations**:
- Local community foundations (every major city has one)
- Often have health/rare disease funds
- Smaller amounts ($5K-$25K) but excellent for local programs

**5. Professional Associations**:
- **AFP** (Association of Fundraising Professionals): Grant opportunities newsletter
- **NORD** (National Organization for Rare Disorders): Member foundation grants database
- **ATS/ERS** (pulmonary societies): Research grants, advocacy funding

---

### Funder Screening Criteria

**Must-Haves** (deal-breakers if absent):
- ✅ **Geographic Match**: Funder gives in Foundation's state/region (or national scope)
- ✅ **Issue Area Match**: Health, rare disease, patient advocacy, research
- ✅ **Grant Size Fit**: Foundation can realistically request $25K-$500K (match program scale)
- ✅ **Eligibility**: 501(c)(3) required, no religious/political restrictions that exclude Foundation

**Nice-to-Haves** (increase chances):
- ✅ Prior rare disease funding (demonstrates understanding)
- ✅ Multi-year commitment potential (sustainability)
- ✅ Low barrier to entry (no LOI required, rolling deadlines)
- ✅ Relationship connection (Board member knows funder trustee)

**Red Flags** (avoid):
- ❌ Funder's mission misaligned (e.g., environmental focus, no health grants)
- ❌ Extremely competitive (1,000 applicants for 10 grants—low ROI)
- ❌ Bureaucratic nightmare (50-page application for $5K grant—not worth staff time)
- ❌ Reputation issues (funder known for poor communication, late payments)

---

### Prospecting Workflow

**Monthly Pipeline Meeting** (Development team):
1. Review 10 new prospects (Grants Manager researches, presents)
2. Rate each: **A** (strong fit, pursue), **B** (maybe, if capacity), **C** (pass)
3. Assign next steps: "A" prospects → cultivation phase, "B" → watch list, "C" → archive
4. Track in CRM (Salesforce, Bloomerang, or grant management software)

**Prospecting Metrics**:
- Prospects identified: 50-100/year
- Prospects advanced to cultivation: 30-50/year
- Proposals submitted: 20-30/year
- Grants awarded: 8-12/year (goal)

---

## Funder Research & Cultivation

### Deep Dive Research

**For Each "A" Prospect**, compile **Funder Profile**:

**Basic Info**:
- Funder name, address, website
- Contact person (Program Officer, Grants Manager)
- Tax ID, foundation type (private, corporate, community)

**Giving History**:
- Total assets, annual giving amount
- Grant range ($10K-$500K typical)
- Recent grants (search 990-PF on GuideStar—shows all grants >$5K)
- Similar organizations funded (other rare disease foundations, patient advocacy groups)

**Application Process**:
- LOI required or full proposal directly?
- Deadline (annual, quarterly, rolling)
- Average turnaround (3 months, 6 months)
- Site visits common? (some funders visit before awarding)

**Decision-Makers**:
- Board of Directors (private foundations—often family members)
- Program Officers (community foundations, corporate—staff make recommendations)
- Advisory Committees (some funders have health advisory boards)

**Strategic Intel**:
- Funder priorities this year (read annual report, press releases)
- Recent funding trends (increasing/decreasing health grants?)
- Relationship connections (does any Board member know their Board?)

---

### Cultivation Activities

**Goal**: Educate funder about AATD, demonstrate Foundation's impact, build trust—before asking for money.

**Cultivation Tactics**:

**1. Introductory Email** (Program Officer):
> Subject: Introduction—Mark Egly Foundation (Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Advocacy)
>
> Dear [Name],
>
> I'm [Your Name], Chief Development Officer at Mark Egly Foundation, the leading patient advocacy organization for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD)—a rare genetic lung/liver disease affecting 100,000+ Americans.
>
> I noticed [Funder] recently funded [Similar Organization]'s rare disease program. We'd love to explore alignment with [Funder]'s health priorities.
>
> Would you be open to a 15-minute call to learn about our work?
>
> Thank you,
> [Your Name]

**Response Rate**: 30-50% respond to cold emails (higher if you mention connection or their recent grant).

---

**2. Informational Call** (15-30 minutes):
- **Ask questions**: "What health issues is [Funder] prioritizing this year?"
- **Listen 70%, talk 30%**: Learn what funder cares about, then connect Foundation's work to their priorities
- **No ask yet**: End with "Thank you, this is helpful. May I follow up when we have a program that aligns?"

**3. Send Materials** (post-call):
- **Annual Report** (PDF or print)
- **One-Pager**: Foundation overview (mission, programs, impact stats, budget)
- **Impact Story**: 2-page case study (patient testimonial, program success)
- **Personalized note**: "Thank you for your time. Excited about potential partnership."

**4. In-Person Meeting** (if funder local):
- Invite Program Officer to Foundation office or site visit (support group, patient event)
- Meet patients, see programs firsthand (builds emotional connection)
- Still no ask—just relationship building

**5. Invite to Events**:
- Foundation fundraiser, gala, patient conference
- Funder sees community, energy, mission in action
- Networking opportunity (funder meets Board, donors, patients)

**Cultivation Timeline**: 1-6 months (some funders cultivated 1-2 years before first proposal—especially major foundations).

---

## Letter of Inquiry (LOI) Development

### When LOI Required

**Purpose**: Screening tool—funder reviews 100 LOIs, invites 20-30 to submit full proposals (saves everyone time).

**Typical Length**: 2-3 pages, 1,000-1,500 words

**Components**:
1. **Organization Overview** (1 paragraph): Mission, history, credibility
2. **Problem Statement** (1 paragraph): Why AATD patients need this program
3. **Proposed Solution** (1-2 paragraphs): What Foundation will do, how it addresses problem
4. **Expected Outcomes** (1 paragraph): Measurable impact (# patients served, % improvement)
5. **Budget Summary** (1 sentence): Total project cost, amount requested from funder
6. **Organizational Capacity** (1 paragraph): Why Foundation can deliver (track record, expertise)

---

### LOI Writing Best Practices

**Lead with Impact**: Start with compelling patient story or statistic ("75% of AATD patients undiagnosed—leading to preventable lung damage").

**Be Specific**: Avoid jargon, vague goals. Instead of "improve patient outcomes," say "increase diagnostic rate by 20% through 500 physician education webinars."

**Demonstrate Need**: Use data (patient surveys, epidemiology studies, gaps in current services).

**Show Capacity**: Mention key staff qualifications, partnerships, past successes ("Our diagnosis program identified 200 new patients in Year 1").

**Match Funder Priorities**: Echo funder's language ("Your foundation prioritizes health equity—our program targets underserved rural communities").

**Proofread**: Typos signal sloppiness. Have 2 people review before submitting.

---

### LOI Submission & Follow-Up

**Submission**:
- Submit via funder's online portal (most common) OR email if no portal
- Confirm receipt within 24 hours (email or phone)
- Log in CRM: Date submitted, amount requested, decision timeline

**Follow-Up**:
- If invited to full proposal: Celebrate, start drafting immediately (usually 30-60 day deadline)
- If declined: Email thank-you, ask for feedback ("We'd appreciate any suggestions for future submissions"), maintain relationship
- If no response: Follow up after stated timeline + 2 weeks ("Checking status of our LOI submitted [date]")

**Invite Rate**: 20-30% of LOIs invited to full proposal (strong LOI can increase to 40-50%).

---

## Full Proposal Writing Process

### Proposal Components

**Standard Grant Proposal** (10-20 pages):

1. **Cover Letter** (1 page): Personalized, signed by ED, summarizes request
2. **Executive Summary** (1 page): Condensed version (organization, project, budget, impact)
3. **Organizational Overview** (2 pages): History, mission, programs, governance, financials
4. **Problem/Need Statement** (2-3 pages): Document the problem (AATD burden, gaps in care)
5. **Program Description** (3-5 pages): Goals, activities, timeline, staffing, partnerships
6. **Evaluation Plan** (2 pages): How success measured (metrics, data collection, reporting)
7. **Budget & Justification** (2 pages): Detailed budget, narrative explaining costs
8. **Sustainability Plan** (1 page): How program continues after grant ends
9. **Appendices**: 990, audited financials, Board list, letters of support

---

### Writing Assignments

**Collaborative Process**:

**Grants Manager**: Leads writing, coordinates team
**Program Staff**: Write program description, evaluation plan (they know program details)
**Finance**: Create budget, budget narrative
**ED/Chief Development Officer**: Write organizational overview, cover letter
**External Evaluator** (if applicable): Design evaluation, contribute evaluation section

**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks from LOI invitation to submission deadline (don't wait until last minute).

---

### Proposal Writing Best Practices

**SMART Goals**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
- ❌ Weak: "Improve patient quality of life"
- ✅ Strong: "Increase patient knowledge of AATD self-management by 30% (pre/post-test) among 200 support group participants within 18 months"

**Logic Model**: Show how activities → outputs → outcomes → impact
- **Activities**: Education webinars
- **Outputs**: 500 clinicians trained
- **Outcomes**: Clinicians order more diagnostic tests
- **Impact**: 100 additional AATD patients diagnosed, receive treatment, avoid complications

**Evidence-Based**: Cite research, pilot data, peer models
- "Our pilot program in Ohio diagnosed 50 patients in 6 months—we're ready to scale nationally."
- "Studies show genetic counseling increases testing uptake by 40% (Smith et al. 2022, AJRCCM)."

**Storytelling**: Weave patient stories throughout (humanizes data)
- "Maria, age 45, struggled with shortness of breath for 10 years before our program identified her AATD. Now on augmentation therapy, she's back to hiking with her kids."

**Address Potential Concerns**: Anticipate funder questions
- If program new: "While this program is new, our team has 50+ years combined experience in rare disease advocacy."
- If budget high: "Cost per patient ($500) is far less than cost of one COPD hospitalization ($15,000)—this is prevention investment."

**Visuals**: Include charts, photos, infographics (break up text, improve readability)
- Program timeline (Gantt chart)
- Impact dashboard (# patients served, satisfaction %)
- Photos of patients, support groups, events (with photo releases)

---

### Sample Grant Budget

**Program**: AATD Patient Navigation Program (Year 1)
**Total Budget**: $250,000
**Funder Request**: $200,000 (Foundation contributes $50,000 match)

| **Category**              | **Description**                               | **Amount**   | **% of Budget** |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| **Personnel**             |                                               |              |                 |
| Program Manager (1.0 FTE) | Salary ($70,000) + benefits ($21,000)         | $91,000      | 36%             |
| Patient Navigators (2.0)  | Salaries ($100,000) + benefits ($30,000)      | $130,000     | 52%             |
| Grants Manager (0.2 FTE)  | Grant administration (salary $15,000 + benefits $4,500) | $19,500 | 8%              |
| **Subtotal Personnel**    |                                               | **$240,500** | **96%**         |
| **Program Expenses**      |                                               |              |                 |
| Educational Materials     | Brochures, videos, patient guides             | $3,000       | 1.2%            |
| Travel                    | Patient events, conferences                   | $2,500       | 1%              |
| Technology                | CRM licenses, telehealth platform             | $2,000       | 0.8%            |
| **Subtotal Program**      |                                               | **$7,500**   | **3%**          |
| **Indirect Costs**        | Rent, utilities, admin (5% of direct costs)   | $2,000       | 0.8%            |
| **Total Budget**          |                                               | **$250,000** | **100%**        |

**Notes**:
- Indirect rate 5% (low—demonstrates efficiency, many funders cap indirect at 10-15%)
- Foundation match $50,000 (demonstrates sustainability, shared investment)
- Personnel-heavy (typical for direct-service program—navigators are the program)

---

### Budget Justification Narrative

**For Each Line Item**, explain:
- **What**: Specific expense
- **Why**: How it supports program
- **How Calculated**: Unit cost × quantity

**Example**:

> **Program Manager (1.0 FTE) - $91,000**
>
> The Program Manager will oversee the Patient Navigation Program, supervise 2 navigators, coordinate partnerships with clinics, and ensure quality service delivery. This is a full-time position (40 hours/week) with annual salary of $70,000 plus benefits (health insurance, retirement, payroll taxes) totaling $21,000 (30% of salary). The Program Manager has 8 years experience in rare disease patient services and holds a Certified Health Navigation credential.

---

### Funder-Specific Budget Guidance

**Foundation Grants**: Often prefer lower indirect rates (5-10%—want money to "go directly to programs").

**Corporate Grants**: May require brand visibility (e.g., logo on materials—budget for graphic design).

**Government Grants**: Strict indirect rate negotiations (many nonprofits have federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreements—NICRA).

**Multi-Year Grants**: Show escalating budgets with inflation adjustments (Year 2 salaries 3% higher than Year 1).

---

### Grant Tracking Database

**Track All Proposals** (submitted and pending):

| **Funder**              | **Program**      | **Amount**  | **Submitted** | **Decision Date** | **Status**        | **Next Steps**           |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| ABC Foundation          | Patient Nav      | $200,000    | 11/1/2025     | 2/1/2026          | Pending           | Follow up 1/15/2026      |
| XYZ Corporate Fund      | Research Grant   | $150,000    | 10/15/2025    | 12/15/2025        | Finalist (finalist interview 12/1) | Prepare presentation |
| Community Foundation    | Support Groups   | $50,000     | 9/20/2025     | 11/30/2025        | Declined          | Request feedback, reapply next year |
| Federal Grant (HRSA)    | Rare Disease Hub | $500,000    | 8/1/2025      | 3/1/2026          | Under review      | Site visit scheduled 1/20/2026 |

**CRM Integration**: If using Salesforce, Bloomerang, or grant software (Foundant, Instrumentl)—track proposals as "opportunities" with stages (prospecting, cultivation, submitted, awarded, declined).

---

### Managing Deadlines

**Grant Calendar** (shared Google Calendar or project management tool):
- Color-coded by funder type (blue = foundation, green = corporate, red = government)
- Alerts set for 60 days, 30 days, 7 days before deadline
- Include decision dates (when funder announces awards)

**Workload Balancing**: Avoid submitting 5 proposals in one week (burnout, quality suffers). Space submissions throughout year.

---

## Award Negotiation & Acceptance

### Award Notification

**Congratulations Call**: Funder calls or emails: "We're pleased to award $200,000 for your Patient Navigation Program."

**Immediate Response**:
- **Thank funder** (verbally and in writing within 24 hours)
- **Confirm acceptance** (pending grant agreement review—see next section)
- **Ask clarifying questions**: Payment schedule, reporting requirements, site visits planned?

---

### Negotiation Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Partial Funding**
- **Funder says**: "We're awarding $150,000 instead of $200,000 requested."
- **Foundation options**:
  - Accept and scale program (serve 150 patients instead of 200)
  - Accept and find co-funders (apply to another funder for remaining $50K)
  - Decline if program not viable at reduced funding (rare, but ethical if you can't deliver)

**Scenario 2: Restricted Use**
- **Funder says**: "We'll fund salaries but not indirect costs."
- **Foundation response**: Negotiate compromise ("Could you fund 50% indirect? We need to cover rent, utilities for program space") OR accept and budget indirect from unrestricted funds

**Scenario 3: Timeline Changes**
- **Funder says**: "We can't start funding until July (3 months later than you requested)."
- **Foundation response**: Adjust program timeline, delay hiring, or use bridge funding (line of credit, reserves) to start on time

**Red Flags** (consider declining):
- ❌ Funder requires rights to all program data, IP (threatens patient privacy, organizational autonomy)
- ❌ Funder demands Board seat (conflicts of interest, governance issues)
- ❌ Funding contingent on unethical activities (promoting funder's product over patient needs)

---

## Grant Agreement Review

### Legal Review Process

**Before Signing**, have attorney review if:
- Grant >$100,000 (large financial commitment)
- Unusual terms (IP rights, data ownership, naming rights)
- Multi-year commitment (legal obligations beyond current fiscal year)
- New funder (no track record, uncertain reputation)

**Attorney Review Cost**: $500-$2,000 (worth investment to avoid costly mistakes).

---

### Key Contract Terms to Scrutinize

**1. Payment Schedule**:
- **Upfront**: Funder pays full amount at grant start (best for cash flow)
- **Quarterly**: Funder pays 25% every 3 months (requires cash flow management)
- **Reimbursement**: Foundation spends first, submits invoices, funder reimburses 30-60 days later (strains cash flow—may need line of credit)

**2. Reporting Requirements**:
- **Frequency**: Monthly, quarterly, annually (monthly is burdensome for small staff)
- **Format**: Narrative + financials (standard), site visits (time-intensive), data dashboards (requires tech infrastructure)
- **Deliverables**: Specific outputs required (# patients served, # clinicians trained)

**3. Budget Flexibility**:
- **Line-item budget**: Can't move >10% between categories without funder approval (restrictive)
- **Categorical budget**: Flexibility within personnel, program, indirect (preferred)
- **No-cost extensions**: Can Foundation request extra time to spend funds if program delayed? (Most funders allow one 6-12 month extension)

**4. Intellectual Property**:
- **Foundation owns**: Curriculum, data, publications (standard)
- **Joint ownership**: If funder co-develops (negotiate carefully)
- **Funder owns**: Red flag (Foundation invests time, funder profits)

**5. Termination Clauses**:
- **For cause**: Funder can terminate if Foundation breaches contract (fraud, noncompliance—reasonable)
- **For convenience**: Funder can terminate anytime without cause (risky—means mid-year funding loss)
- **Repayment**: If terminated, must Foundation repay unspent funds? (Yes—standard) Spent funds? (No—unless fraud)

**6. Publicity & Recognition**:
- **Logo use**: Funder logo on materials, website, events (standard)
- **Press releases**: Joint announcements (coordinate messaging)
- **Naming rights**: "ABC Foundation AATD Patient Navigation Program" (acceptable if not in perpetuity)

---

### Signing Authority

**Who Signs Grant Agreements**:
- **Executive Director** (most grants)
- **Board Chair** (if ED unavailable or if funder requires Board signature for >$250K grants)
- **COO** (if delegated authority in delegation matrix)

**Board Approval**: Not required for every grant, but recommended for:
- Grants >$250,000
- Multi-year grants (>3 years)
- Grants with unusual terms (IP, exclusivity, etc.)

---

## Compliance & Reporting Requirements

### Compliance Framework

**Grant Compliance Officer**: Grants Manager (Year 1-2) or dedicated Compliance Manager (Year 3+).

**Responsibilities**:
- Track all grant requirements (reporting deadlines, deliverables)
- Ensure timely submission (reports, invoices)
- Coordinate with program and finance teams
- Alert leadership to compliance risks

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

**Minor Issues** (late report by 1 week):
- Funder sends reminder
- Foundation apologizes, submits immediately
- No penalty if isolated incident

**Moderate Issues** (missed deliverable, budget overrun):
- Funder requests corrective action plan
- Foundation submits plan, implements changes
- May affect future funding (funder notes in file)

**Major Issues** (fraud, misuse of funds, repeated non-compliance):
- Funder terminates grant
- Foundation must repay funds
- Potential legal action
- Reputation damage (other funders learn)

**Foundation Commitment**: Zero tolerance for compliance failures—invest in systems, training, oversight to prevent issues.

---

## Financial Management & Drawdowns

### Grant Accounting

**Separate Tracking** (per grant):
- Each grant = separate project code in accounting software (QuickBooks, Sage Intacct)
- All expenses charged to grant coded with project code
- Separate bank account NOT required (but some funders prefer—ask)

**Restricted Funds Accounting**:
- Grant revenue recorded as **temporarily restricted net assets** (GAAP requirement)
- As funds spent, **released from restriction** to unrestricted (matches expenses)
- Ensures grants used only for intended purpose

---

### Budget Monitoring

**Monthly Review** (Grants Manager + Finance Director):
- Compare actual expenses to grant budget
- **Variance Analysis**: Why did we spend $12,000 on travel when budget was $10,000?
  - Acceptable variance: Unforeseen conference opportunity, advance funder approval
  - Unacceptable variance: Poor budget planning, spending without approval
- **Reforecasting**: If budget off-track, reforecast remaining year, identify corrective action

**Red Flags**:
- Spending too fast (50% of budget spent in first 25% of grant period—will run out of money)
- Spending too slow (10% spent halfway through grant—program not launching, funder may reclaim funds)
- Over-budget categories (need funder approval to reallocate)

---

### Drawdown Procedures

**Reimbursement-Based Grants**:
1. **Incur Expenses**: Foundation pays vendors, employees
2. **Compile Invoices**: Monthly or quarterly, gather receipts, timesheets
3. **Submit Drawdown Request**: Invoice packet to funder (cover letter, detailed expense report, supporting docs)
4. **Funder Review**: 30-60 day review period
5. **Payment**: Check or ACH transfer
6. **Cash Flow Gap**: Foundation must bridge (line of credit, reserves—see Cash Flow Management in Budget Development Process document)

**Advance Payment Grants**:
1. **Grant Starts**: Funder sends first payment (25-100% of grant)
2. **Foundation Spends**: Pay expenses as incurred
3. **Report Spending**: Quarterly financial reports show how funds used
4. **Next Payment**: Funder sends next installment (if multi-payment schedule)

**Best Practice**: Track drawdowns in separate spreadsheet (date requested, amount, date received, variance from expected).

## Program Reporting & Success Stories

### Quarterly Program Reports

**Standard Format** (3-5 pages):

**1. Executive Summary** (1 paragraph):
- "In Q3, Patient Navigation Program served 62 patients (vs. 50 goal), connected 15 to clinical trials, and achieved 95% satisfaction rating."

**2. Activities This Quarter**:
- List major activities (support groups held, patients enrolled, educational webinars delivered)
- Compare to grant proposal timeline (on track? ahead? behind?)

**3. Outputs & Outcomes**:
- **Outputs**: Quantifiable deliverables (# patients served, # navigators hired, # trainings conducted)
- **Outcomes**: Impact on patients (% who started treatment, % who report improved QOL)

**4. Success Stories** (1-2 patient stories):
- Compelling narrative (with patient permission and photo release)
- Shows real-world impact (not just numbers)

**5. Challenges & Solutions**:
- Honest about obstacles (hiring delays, lower enrollment than expected)
- Demonstrate problem-solving (adjusted outreach strategy, hired recruiter)

**6. Next Quarter Plans**:
- Preview upcoming activities (hiring complete, launching new initiative)

**7. Financial Summary**:
- Total spent this quarter, year-to-date, % of budget expended
- Any variances (explained briefly—detail in separate financial report)

---

### Annual Reports

**More Comprehensive** (10-15 pages):
- All elements of quarterly report, plus:
- **Evaluation Findings**: Formal evaluation results (pre/post tests, focus groups, patient surveys)
- **Partnership Highlights**: Collaborations with clinics, researchers, patient orgs
- **Media Coverage**: Press releases, news articles, social media reach
- **Sustainability Progress**: Steps toward program continuation (additional funders secured, revenue generated)
- **Photos & Infographics**: Visual storytelling (patient photos, data dashboards)

---

### Success Story Best Practices

**Patient Story Template**:

> **How Maria Found Her Diagnosis—And Her Community**
>
> For 10 years, Maria struggled with shortness of breath, fatigue, and frequent lung infections. Despite multiple doctor visits, no one could explain why a non-smoker in her 40s had COPD-like symptoms.
>
> Then Maria attended a Mark Egly Foundation support group. Our Patient Navigator recognized her symptoms and suggested genetic testing for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD). The test was positive.
>
> "I finally had answers," Maria says. "And more importantly, I had treatment options."
>
> Maria started augmentation therapy and joined our online support community. Six months later, her lung function stabilized, and she returned to hiking with her kids.
>
> **Impact by the Numbers**:
> - **1** Patient Navigator conversation changed Maria's life
> - **10 years** of misdiagnosis ended
> - **50+** Other patients diagnosed through our program this year
>
> _[Photo: Maria hiking with her kids, smiling]_
>
> _Maria's story is shared with her permission._

## Grant Closeout Procedures

### Final Reporting

**Final Report Due** (typically 30-60 days after grant end date):

**Content**:
- **Full Grant Period Summary**: All activities, outputs, outcomes (cumulative)
- **Goals Met**: Compare actual to proposed (Did you serve 200 patients as promised? If not, why?)
- **Lessons Learned**: Candid reflection (What worked? What didn't? What would you do differently?)
- **Sustainability Update**: Program continuing? New funders secured? Program ended?
- **Final Financials**: Total spent, budget vs. actual, any unspent funds

**Unspent Funds**:
- If grant allows carryover, request extension (spend in Year 2)
- If not, return to funder (check with amount)
- Never spend unspent funds on non-grant activities without funder permission (fraud)

---

### Financial Reconciliation

**Final Financial Report**:
- **Total Revenue Received**: All payments from funder
- **Total Expenses Incurred**: All project costs (charged to grant project code)
- **Variance**: Should be near zero (within 1-2%)
  - If under-budget: Explain why (cost savings, program completed for less)
  - If over-budget: Explain how gap funded (Foundation match increased, other funder covered overrun)

**Audit Trail**: Keep all receipts, invoices, timesheets, financial reports for **7 years** (IRS retention requirement, many funders require 5-7 years).

---

### Stewardship & Thank You

**Closeout Thank-You Letter** (ED signature):
> Dear [Funder],
>
> On behalf of the Board, staff, and 200 patients served through the ABC Foundation AATD Patient Navigation Program, thank you for your transformative $200,000 grant.
>
> Because of your support, 200 patients received one-on-one navigation, 150 started treatment, and 85% report improved quality of life. You made this possible.
>
> We look forward to continuing our partnership and updating you on our progress.
>
> With gratitude,
> [Executive Director]

**Additional Stewardship**:
- Send annual reports to past funders (even after grant ends—keep them engaged)
- Invite to events (funder recognition event, patient conference)
- Share success stories (email updates, social media tags)
- Request testimonial ("Would you be willing to provide a quote about our partnership for our website?")

## Funder Relationship Management

### Building Long-Term Partnerships

**Goal**: Convert one-time funders to multi-year partners.

**Strategies**:

**1. Over-Communicate**: Share updates beyond required reports (quarterly e-newsletters, patient stories, event invites).

**2. Involve Funders**: Invite to site visits, program observations, Board presentations (builds investment, ownership).

**3. Recognize Publicly**: Thank funders in annual report, website, social media (most funders appreciate recognition—check if they prefer anonymity).

**4. Demonstrate Impact**: Use data, stories, visuals to show how their dollars made difference (funders want to see ROI).

**5. Seek Feedback**: Ask "How can we improve our reporting? What information is most useful to you?" (shows partnership, not transactional relationship).

**6. Invite Renewal**: 6 months before grant ends, approach funder about Year 2 funding ("Would you consider continuing your support? Here's our proposed plan…").

---

### Managing Difficult Funders

**Scenario 1: Micromanaging Funder**
- **Symptom**: Weekly emails asking for updates, frequent calls, excessive reporting requests
- **Response**: Set boundaries politely ("We'll provide quarterly reports as agreed—happy to schedule check-in calls each quarter if helpful"), loop in ED if escalates

**Scenario 2: Slow-Paying Funder**
- **Symptom**: Payment 90 days overdue, affecting Foundation cash flow
- **Response**: Polite reminder emails (escalate to funder's CFO if necessary), pause program if payment critical, consider not reapplying if chronic issue

**Scenario 3: Scope Creep**
- **Symptom**: Funder asks Foundation to add activities not in grant proposal ("Can you also do genetic testing?" when grant was for education only)
- **Response**: "We'd love to, but that's beyond current grant scope. Would you consider supplemental funding to expand?" OR "Let's discuss for Year 2 renewal."

**Scenario 4: Reputation Risk**
- **Symptom**: Funder embroiled in scandal (corruption, unethical practices)
- **Response**: Consult legal counsel, consider returning grant if association threatens Foundation's reputation (rare, but protecting mission comes first)

## Grant Management Software & Tools

### Software Options

**Year 1-2** (Budget <$100K grants revenue):
- **Spreadsheets** (Excel, Google Sheets): Free, simple, sufficient for 5-10 grants
- **Shared Drives** (Google Drive, Dropbox): Store proposals, reports, correspondence

**Year 3-5** (Budget $500K-$2M grants revenue):
- **Grant Management Software**: Dedicated tools for prospecting, tracking, reporting

**Top Platforms**:

**1. Foundant GLM (Grant Lifecycle Manager)**:
- **Cost**: $3,000-$6,000/year (nonprofit pricing)
- **Features**: Funder database, proposal tracking, reporting calendar, document library
- **Best For**: Small-to-midsize nonprofits (5-50 grants/year)

**2. Submittable**:
- **Cost**: $5,000-$12,000/year
- **Features**: Application portal (if Foundation offers grants), funder portal, reviewer workflows
- **Best For**: Foundations that GIVE grants (not just receive)—Mark Egly Foundation may offer microgrants to patients (travel stipends, etc.)

**3. Instrumentl**:
- **Cost**: $1,500-$3,000/year
- **Features**: AI-powered funder matching, grant prospecting, deadline tracking, saved searches
- **Best For**: Grant prospecting (finding new funders)—pairs well with Foundant for full lifecycle

**4. CRM Integration (Salesforce, Bloomerang)**:
- **Cost**: Included if already using CRM for donor management
- **Features**: Track grants as "opportunities," link to funder contacts, report on pipeline
- **Best For**: Organizations with existing CRM (avoid duplicate systems)

---

### Software ROI Calculation

**Manual Process** (spreadsheets):
- Grants Manager spends 10 hours/week on administrative tasks (tracking, reminders, filing)
- 10 hours × 52 weeks = 520 hours/year × $40/hour = **$20,800 staff cost**

**With Software** (automated tracking, alerts):
- Grants Manager spends 5 hours/week on admin (50% reduction)
- 5 hours × 52 weeks = 260 hours/year × $40/hour = **$10,400 staff cost**
- **Savings**: $10,400/year - Software cost ($5,000) = **$5,400 net savings** + intangible benefits (fewer missed deadlines, better reporting)

**Decision Point**: When managing 20+ grants/year, software pays for itself.

---

## Budget & Resource Planning

### Year 1 Budget (5-10 employees, $500K total budget)

**Grants Revenue Goal**: $200,000-$300,000 (40-60% of budget—healthy mix with individual donors, events)

**Grant Staffing**:
- **Chief Development Officer** (1.0 FTE): $90,000-$110,000 (oversees all fundraising, writes major proposals)
- **Grants Manager** (0.5-1.0 FTE): $50,000-$70,000 (prospecting, tracking, reporting)

**Software & Tools**:
- **Foundation Directory Online**: $1,500/year
- **Grants.gov (free)**, state/local databases: $0
- **Spreadsheets**: $0 (Year 1)

**Professional Development**:
