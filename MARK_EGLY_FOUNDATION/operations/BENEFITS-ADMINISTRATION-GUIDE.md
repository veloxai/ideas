### New Hire Enrollment Process

**Timeline**:

| **Day**            | **Action**                                                                                        | **Responsible Party** | **Deliverable**                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Offer Accepted** | Send benefits overview packet (PDF + links to carrier websites)                                   | COO/HR                | Benefits summary, plan comparison charts, vendor contact info |
| **Day 1**          | Benefits enrollment meeting (30-60 min—explain options, answer questions)                         | COO/HR                | Complete enrollment forms (paper or online portal)            |
| **Day 10**         | Enrollment deadline (carrier enrollment windows require submission 20 days before coverage start) | Employee              | All forms submitted, elections made                           |
| **Day 30**         | Coverage effective date (1st of month following 30 days—e.g., hire Oct 15 → coverage Dec 1)       | Carriers              | Insurance ID cards mailed/emailed                             |
| **Day 45**         | Follow-up (received cards? any issues?)                                                           | COO/HR                | Confirm enrollment complete                                   |

**Required Documents** (Employee provides):

- [ ] Enrollment forms (health, dental, vision—if electing)
- [ ] Beneficiary designation (life insurance, 401k)
- [ ] Dependent verification (marriage certificate, birth certificates for children—prevent fraud)
- [ ] W-4 (tax withholding—affects payroll deductions)
- [ ] Direct deposit form (paycheck + 401k contribution routing)

---

### Enrollment Elections

**Decision Support**:

- **Health Plan Comparison Tool**: Excel calculator (input expected medical costs → recommends PPO vs. HDHP based on total cost)
- **Example Scenarios**:
  - _Healthy 30-year-old, no prescriptions_: HDHP saves $600/year (lower premium) + $500 HSA contribution = $1,100 advantage
  - _Family with chronic condition, $5K annual medical costs_: PPO saves $800/year (lower deductible absorbs costs better)

**Default Elections** (if employee doesn't enroll by Day 10):

- **Health/Dental/Vision**: Waived (employee misses window, must wait until next open enrollment or qualifying life event)
- **401(k)**: Not enrolled (no auto-enrollment Year 1—too complex, consider Year 3+)
- **FSA**: $0 contribution
- **Life/Disability**: Auto-enrolled (Foundation-paid, no employee action needed)

---

### Open Enrollment (Annual)

**Timing**: November 1-30 each year (coverage changes effective January 1)

**Changes Allowed**:

- Health/dental/vision plan selection (switch from PPO to HDHP or vice versa)
- Add/drop dependents
- FSA contribution amounts (new year = new election, no carryover except $640 grace amount)
- Supplemental life insurance (increase/decrease coverage)

**Communication Plan** (October-November):

- **Week 1 (Oct 1-7)**: Announce open enrollment (email, all-staff meeting—upcoming changes, timeline)
- **Week 2 (Oct 8-14)**: Distribute enrollment packets (plan comparisons, rate changes, decision tools)
- **Week 3 (Oct 15-21)**: Individual benefits meetings (COO meets 1-on-1 with employees, answer questions—15-30 min each)
- **Week 4-8 (Oct 22-Nov 30)**: Open enrollment window (employees submit elections)
- **Week 9 (Dec 1-7)**: Confirm enrollments (COO reviews all submissions, catches errors before effective date)

---

## Health Insurance Administration

### Plan Selection (Year 1)

**Carrier Options** (evaluate 3-5 carriers annually):

- **Medical Mutual of Ohio** (regional—strong Ohio network, nonprofit-friendly)
- **Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield** (national—broader network if remote employees in other states)
- **UnitedHealthcare** (national—good for multi-state, but higher admin fees)
- **CareSource** (Ohio Medicaid/marketplace—lower-cost option, but limited provider network)
- **Level Funded Plans** (Year 3+—self-funded with stop-loss insurance, potential savings 10-20% if healthy population)

**Decision Criteria**:

1. **Network adequacy** (Are Cleveland Clinic, Ohio State Wexner in-network?—critical for Alpha-1 patients on staff)
2. **Premium cost** (Foundation pays 80%, but employees pay 20%—affordable?)
3. **Out-of-pocket max** ($2K-$5K range—catastrophic protection)
4. **Prescription drug coverage** (Alpha-1 augmentation therapy = $100K/year—ensure specialty pharmacy included)
5. **Nonprofit discounts** (10-30% off standard rates—negotiate aggressively)
6. **Customer service** (Can employees reach claims rep easily? Average hold time <10 min?)

**Foundation's Year 1 Selection** (Example):

- **Carrier**: Medical Mutual of Ohio
- **Plan**: PPO Plan (BlueCross BlueShield network) + HDHP option
- **Annual Premium**: $8,000/employee (single), $18,000/employee (family)—Foundation pays 80% = $6,400 single / $14,400 family
- **Network**: 95% of Ohio providers in-network

---

### Enrollment & ID Cards

**Process**:

1. Employee completes enrollment form (online portal or paper)
2. COO submits enrollment file to carrier (secure portal upload—CSV with employee name, SSN, DOB, plan election, dependent info)
3. Carrier processes (5-10 business days)
4. ID cards mailed to employee home address (7-14 days) + digital card available in carrier app immediately

**Troubleshooting**:

- **Card not received**: Log into carrier portal (www.medmutual.com) → Download digital card → Use at pharmacy/doctor same day
- **Dependent not showing**: COO contacts carrier (check if dependent verification documents submitted—birth certificate, marriage certificate)
- **Wrong plan**: Enrollment change within 30 days = no penalty; after 30 days = wait until next open enrollment

---

### Premium Payment & Billing

**Billing Cycle**: Monthly (carrier invoices Foundation on 15th of month, due by 25th)

**Payment Method**: ACH auto-debit (Foundation bank account → carrier on due date—avoids late payment, coverage termination)

**Premium Reconciliation** (Monthly Task—COO):

1. Receive carrier invoice (PDF or CSV—lists all enrolled employees, dependents, premium amounts)
2. Compare to payroll deductions (Did Foundation deduct correct employee share from paychecks?)
3. Identify discrepancies (new hires not yet on invoice, terminations still billed—carrier lags 1 month)
4. Submit enrollment changes (add new hires effective retro date, terminate ex-employees—receive prorated credit)
5. Pay invoice (ACH or check)

**Example Reconciliation**:

- **Invoice shows**: 10 employees × $800/month = $8,000 total
- **Foundation pays**: 80% = $6,400
- **Employees pay**: 20% = $1,600 (deducted from paychecks—verify $160/employee deducted)
- **Discrepancy found**: Invoice includes terminated employee from 2 months ago (carrier didn't process termination)—COO emails carrier, requests $800 credit

---

### Claims & Customer Service

**Employee Claims Issues**:

- **Denied claim**: Employee calls carrier (number on ID card), appeals if medically necessary (Foundation doesn't adjudicate claims—carrier's responsibility)
- **Out-of-network surprise bill**: Negotiate with carrier (No Surprises Act 2021—protects patients from balance billing for emergency care)
- **Foundation role**: Advocate (if employee can't resolve, COO contacts carrier broker—broker pressures carrier to resolve favorably)

**Common Issues**:

- **Pre-authorization denied** (e.g., MRI not approved): Appeal (physician provides medical necessity letter—85% of appeals succeed)
- **Prescription not covered**: Check formulary (carrier's approved drug list) → Request exception or switch to generic/alternative
- **Billing error** (charged $200 copay, should be $20): Call carrier (reprocess claim—refund issued 4-6 weeks)

---

## Retirement Plan (401k) Administration

### Plan Design

**Plan Type**: Traditional 401(k) + Roth 401(k) option (employee chooses pre-tax or after-tax contributions)

**Contribution Limits** (2025 IRS limits):

- **Employee**: $23,000/year (under age 50), $30,500/year (age 50+)
- **Employer Match**: 50% of first 6% of salary (Year 1-2)—e.g., employee contributes 6% of $50K salary = $3K, Foundation contributes $1.5K
- **Total Combined Limit**: $69,000/year (employee + employer—rarely reached except executives)

**Vesting**: Immediate 100% (employee owns Foundation match from Day 1—if leaves, keeps all contributions + match)

**Investment Options**:

- **Target-Date Funds** (default—automatically rebalances based on retirement year, e.g., "Vanguard Target 2050")
- **Index Funds** (low-cost—S&P 500, Total Market, International)
- **Bond Funds** (conservative—government bonds, corporate bonds)
- **Stable Value Fund** (ultra-conservative—guaranteed principal, ~2-3% return)

---

### Enrollment & Contributions

**How to Enroll**:

1. Employee logs into 401(k) provider portal (Fidelity.com/atwork, username = SSN, initial password emailed)
2. Complete enrollment wizard (5-10 minutes):
   - Contribution rate (% of salary or fixed $$ per paycheck)
   - Pre-tax or Roth (or split—50% pre-tax, 50% Roth)
   - Investment allocation (select funds or use target-date default)
   - Beneficiaries (spouse, children, parents—who inherits if employee dies)
3. Submit (effective next pay period—typically 1-2 weeks delay)

**Payroll Deduction**:

- COO submits payroll file to 401(k) provider each pay period (CSV—employee name, gross pay, contribution $)
- Provider debits Foundation bank account (total contributions—both employee + employer match)
- Contributions invested according to employee elections (trades process within 1-2 business days)

---

### Match Calculation Examples

**Example 1: Employee Contributes 6% (Maximizes Match)**

- Salary: $50,000/year
- Employee contribution: 6% = $3,000/year ($115/paycheck bi-weekly)
- Foundation match: 50% of 6% = 3% of salary = $1,500/year
- Total retirement savings: $4,500/year

**Example 2: Employee Contributes 3% (Partial Match)**

- Salary: $50,000/year
- Employee contribution: 3% = $1,500/year
- Foundation match: 50% of 3% = 1.5% of salary = $750/year (leaving $750 on table—encourage employees to contribute at least 6%)
- Total retirement savings: $2,250/year

**Example 3: Employee Contributes 10% (Exceeds Match Cap)**

- Salary: $50,000/year
- Employee contribution: 10% = $5,000/year
- Foundation match: 50% of 6% = 3% of salary = $1,500/year (match capped at 6%, additional 4% employee contribution not matched)
- Total retirement savings: $6,500/year

---

### Plan Administration Tasks

**Monthly** (COO):

- [ ] Submit payroll contribution file to provider (within 7 days of payroll date—DOL safe harbor)
- [ ] Reconcile contributions (did provider receive correct amount? any failed ACH debits?)

**Quarterly** (COO):

- [ ] Review participant statements (are employees properly invested? any "lost" participants—old employees who left balance but didn't roll over?)
- [ ] Non-discrimination testing (ADP/ACP tests—ensure highly compensated employees not contributing disproportionately more than non-highly compensated; Foundation <20 employees = exempt Year 1-2, required Year 3+)

**Annually** (COO + CPA):

- [ ] File Form 5500 (Annual Return/Report—due 7 months after plan year-end, e.g., Dec 31 plan year → July 31 filing; penalty $250/day if late)
- [ ] Audit (if plan assets >$250M or >100 participants—Foundation exempt Year 1-5, likely required Year 10+)
- [ ] Plan document updates (IRS requires restatement every 6 years—provider typically handles)

---

### Loans & Hardship Withdrawals

**Loans**:

- **Allowed**: Yes (common 401k feature—employee borrows from own account, repays with interest to self)
- **Amount**: Up to 50% of vested balance (max $50,000)
- **Repayment**: 5 years (deducted from paycheck—e.g., $10K loan = $175/month for 60 months at 5% interest)
- **Consequence**: If leave Foundation, loan due within 60 days or treated as taxable distribution (10% penalty if under age 59.5)

**Hardship Withdrawals**:

- **Allowed**: Yes (IRS-approved hardships only—medical, home purchase, tuition, eviction/foreclosure prevention, funeral)
- **Amount**: Minimum necessary (must exhaust other resources first—savings, loans)
- **Tax**: Taxable income + 10% penalty (no penalty if age 59.5+, disabled, or death)
- **Not Repaid**: Permanent withdrawal (reduces retirement savings)

**Foundation Policy**: Discourage hardships (offer EAP financial counseling, emergency loans from emergency fund if established Year 2-3—small $500-$2K loans at 0% interest, repaid via payroll)

---

## Life & Disability Insurance

### Basic Life Insurance

**Coverage**: 1× annual salary (max $50,000—IRS cap for tax-free employer-paid benefit)

**Cost**: Foundation-paid (group rate ~$0.50 per $1,000 coverage per month—e.g., $50K coverage = $25/month)

**Beneficiary**: Employee designates (spouse, children, estate—update via 401k provider portal, typically bundled)

**Claim Process**:

1. Notify COO immediately upon employee death (COO notifies carrier within 24-48 hours)
2. Beneficiary completes claim form (death certificate required)
3. Carrier pays beneficiary (lump sum, typically 30-60 days)

---

### Supplemental Life Insurance (Voluntary)

**Coverage**: Employee purchases additional (up to 5× salary, max $500K)

**Cost**: Employee-paid (rates increase with age—e.g., 30-year-old = $0.10 per $1,000/month, 50-year-old = $0.40 per $1,000/month)

**Underwriting**:

- **Guaranteed Issue**: Up to $150K (no medical exam—employee enrolls within 30 days of hire)
- **Evidence of Insurability**: >$150K (medical questionnaire, possible exam—carrier approves/denies)

---

### Short-Term Disability (STD)

**Coverage**: 60% of salary for up to 90 days if unable to work due to illness/injury

**Waiting Period**: 7 days (employee uses PTO for first 7 days, STD kicks in Day 8)

**Cost**: Foundation-paid (~$0.30 per $100 of payroll—e.g., $50K salary = $150/year)

**Claim Process**:

1. Employee notifies COO (illness/injury prevents work >7 days)
2. COO provides STD claim form (employee + physician complete)
3. Submit to carrier (via secure portal or mail)
4. Carrier reviews (5-10 business days—may request medical records)
5. If approved, benefit paid (60% salary directly to employee, biweekly—Foundation continues health insurance premiums during STD)

**Common Claims**: Surgery recovery (4-12 weeks), pregnancy complications (bed rest), cancer treatment, severe injury (broken leg, back surgery)

---

### Long-Term Disability (LTD)

**Coverage**: 60% of salary after 90 days disability, continuing until age 65 or recovery (whichever earlier)

**Elimination Period**: 90 days (STD covers first 90 days, LTD picks up Day 91)

**Cost**: Foundation-paid (~$0.50 per $100 of payroll—e.g., $50K salary = $250/year)

**Definition of Disability**:

- **First 24 months**: "Own occupation" (unable to perform job duties as patient navigator, grant writer, etc.)
- **After 24 months**: "Any occupation" (unable to perform ANY job for which reasonably qualified—harder standard, carrier may terminate benefits if can do desk job)

**Claim Process**: Similar to STD but more rigorous (carrier requires extensive medical documentation, may hire private investigator to verify disability—common for long-term claims)

---

## Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)

### Healthcare FSA

**Purpose**: Pre-tax savings for out-of-pocket medical expenses (copays, deductibles, prescriptions, glasses, dental, orthodontia)

**Contribution Limit**: $3,200/year (2025 IRS limit—employee elects annual amount, divided by pay periods)

**Eligible Expenses** (IRS Publication 502):

- Medical/dental copays, deductibles, coinsurance
- Prescription drugs (not over-the-counter without prescription)
- Glasses, contacts, LASIK
- Orthodontia (braces—can claim full cost in year paid, even if treatment spans 2 years)
- Chiropractic, acupuncture, mental health (if not covered by insurance)

**Ineligible Expenses**:

- Health insurance premiums (already pre-tax via Section 125 cafeteria plan)
- Over-the-counter drugs (unless prescribed—aspirin, vitamins)
- Cosmetic procedures (Botox, teeth whitening)

**Use-It-Or-Lose-It**:

- **Rule**: Funds must be used by December 31 (+ grace period 2.5 months = March 15 following year)
- **Carryover**: $640 carryover allowed (2025 IRS limit—e.g., contribute $3,200, spend $2,600, carry over $600 to next year)
- **Forfeit**: Remaining funds after March 15 forfeited to Foundation (IRS rule—Foundation may use for plan admin costs or refund prorated to participants)

---

### Dependent Care FSA

**Purpose**: Pre-tax savings for childcare, eldercare (daycare, preschool, after-school programs, adult daycare for disabled parent)

**Contribution Limit**: $5,000/year (married filing jointly or single), $2,500 (married filing separately)

**Eligible Expenses**:

- Daycare (children under 13)
- Preschool (not kindergarten tuition—IRS considers that education, not care)
- Summer day camp (not overnight camp)
- After-school care
- Adult daycare (disabled spouse or parent)

**Ineligible Expenses**:

- Kindergarten through 12th grade tuition
- Overnight camp
- Care provided by dependent (e.g., 16-year-old sibling watching younger sibling—not eligible)

**Reimbursement Timing**: Claims paid as incurred (no front-loading like Healthcare FSA—employee must incur expense before reimbursement)

---

### FSA Administration

**Third-Party Administrator** (TPA): WageWorks, HealthEquity, Payflex (carrier handles claims, debit cards, customer service—Foundation pays admin fee $5-$10/employee/month)

**Employee Claims Process**:

1. Incur eligible expense (pay doctor, pharmacy, daycare)
2. Submit claim (online portal or mobile app—upload receipt, explain expense)
3. TPA reviews (1-3 business days—verify eligible per IRS rules)
4. Reimbursement issued (ACH to employee bank account or debit card—5-10 business days)

**FSA Debit Card**: TPA issues Visa/Mastercard debit card (swipe at pharmacy, doctor—funds auto-deducted from FSA, no paperwork; but must substantiate if merchant not verified—e.g., buy bandages at CVS = auto-approved, buy bandages at Walmart = submit receipt to prove medical expense)

## COBRA Administration

### What is COBRA?

**Law**: Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (1985)—requires employers with ≥20 employees offer continuation of group health insurance to former employees/dependents

**Applicability**: Foundation subject to COBRA once reaches 20 employees (projected Year 2-3)

**Qualifying Events**:

- **Employee**: Termination (voluntary or involuntary except gross misconduct), reduction in hours (<30/week, loses eligibility)
- **Spouse**: Divorce, legal separation, employee death, employee Medicare-eligible
- **Child**: Loses dependent status (age 26), parent's divorce

---

### COBRA Process

**Employer Responsibilities** (COO):

1. **Initial Notice** (within 90 days of plan coverage): Provide COBRA rights notice to all covered employees (one-time, typically at enrollment)
2. **Qualifying Event Notice** (within 30 days of event): When employee terminates, COO sends COBRA election notice to employee + covered dependents
3. **Election Period** (60 days): Former employee decides whether to elect COBRA (no response = waived)
4. **Coverage Continuation** (if elected): 18 months (employee/dependent), 36 months (spouse/child if divorce/death)

**Employee Responsibilities**:

- Pay premium (102% of full cost—100% premium + 2% admin fee—e.g., $800/month employer-paid becomes $816/month employee-paid)
- Pay on time (45 days for first payment, 30 days for subsequent—late = coverage terminated, no reinstatement)

---

### COBRA Cost Example

**Active Employee**:

- Premium: $800/month
- Foundation pays: 80% = $640
- Employee pays: 20% = $160 (deducted from paycheck)

**COBRA (Former Employee)**:

- Premium: $800/month × 102% = $816/month
- Employee pays: 100% = $816 (no employer contribution, must mail check or ACH)

**Why Expensive**: COBRA is often unaffordable ($816/month = $9,792/year for single coverage), causing many to decline and instead enroll in ACA marketplace (healthcare.gov—may qualify for subsidies if income <400% FPL)

---

### COBRA Vendor

**Third-Party Administrator** (TPA): WageWorks COBRA, Payflex, Conexis (handles notices, election tracking, premium collection, IRS compliance—Foundation pays $5-$15/qualified beneficiary/month)

**Why Outsource**: COBRA compliance is complex (strict timelines, penalty $100/day per person for notice failures—$36,500/year for single missed notice). TPA ensures compliance, Foundation avoids DOL audits/penalties.

---

## Life Event Changes

### Mid-Year Election Changes (Special Enrollment)

**Normally**: Benefits elections locked until next open enrollment (November)

**Exception**: IRS-approved "life events" allow mid-year changes (must change within 30 days of event)

**Qualifying Life Events**:

1. **Marriage**: Add spouse to health/dental/vision
2. **Divorce**: Remove ex-spouse (COBRA offered to ex-spouse)
3. **Birth/Adoption**: Add new child
4. **Death**: Remove deceased dependent
5. **Employment Change**: Spouse loses/gains job with benefits (can add to Foundation plan if spouse loses coverage; must drop from Foundation if spouse gains coverage and Foundation plan secondary)
6. **Dependent Ages Out**: Child turns 26 (remove from health plan)
7. **Residence Change**: Move to new state (may need to change plan if provider network doesn't cover new state)

---

---

## Benefits Communication

### New Hire Communication

**Benefits Overview Meeting** (Day 1, 30-60 minutes):

  4. Q&A (address confusion—FSA vs. HSA, 401k match calculation, etc.)
- **Materials**: Benefits summary booklet (8-page PDF—plan details, costs, vendor contacts, decision tools)

---

### Ongoing Communication

**Quarterly Benefits Check-Ins**:

- Email newsletter (1-page—benefits reminders, e.g., "Use your FSA funds before year-end," "401k match tips," "Free EAP counseling available")
- Tips: Promote underutilized benefits (EAP usage typically <5%, goal 10%+)

**Annual Open Enrollment Communication**:

- All-staff meeting (October—45 minutes, explain upcoming changes, answer questions)

---

### Broker Relationship

**Insurance Broker**: Foundation hires broker (Year 1—helps select carriers, negotiate rates, provide ongoing support—typical fee 3-5% of premium, built into carrier pricing, no direct cost to Foundation)

**Broker Value**:

- **Plan Shopping**: Broker solicits quotes from 5+ carriers (Foundation doesn't have relationships with all carriers—broker does)
- **Negotiation**: Broker leverages volume (represents 100+ nonprofit clients—carriers offer better rates to keep broker relationship)
- **Compliance**: Broker provides ACA/ERISA guidance (e.g., "You now have 50 employees, must offer coverage to all full-time or pay penalty")
- **Claims Advocacy**: If employee has complex claim dispute, broker pressures carrier to resolve favorably

**Broker Selection Criteria**:

- Nonprofit experience (understands tight budgets, mission alignment)
- Local presence (can meet in-person for annual review, enrollment support)
- Technology (online enrollment portal—reduces COO admin burden)
- Service (responds within 24 hours, proactive communication)

**Foundation's Broker** (Example): "Nonprofit Benefits Group" (Columbus, OH—specializes in 501(c)(3) organizations, 50+ nonprofit clients)

---

## Compliance & Reporting

### ACA Compliance (Affordable Care Act)

**Employer Mandate** (Applicable Large Employer—ALE):

- **Threshold**: ≥50 full-time equivalent employees (FTE—includes part-time pro-rated, measured over prior calendar year)
- **Requirement**: Offer "affordable" coverage (employee-only premium ≤9.12% of household income—safe harbor: use W-2 wages) to 95% of full-time employees (≥30 hours/week)
- **Penalty**: $2,970/year per full-time employee (minus first 30) if don't offer coverage; $4,460/year per employee who receives ACA marketplace subsidy if coverage not affordable

**Foundation Status**:

- **Year 1-2** (5-20 employees): NOT an ALE—no mandate, but offering benefits to attract talent
- **Year 3-5** (20-50 employees): Approaching ALE—monitor FTE count
- **Year 6+** (50+ employees): ALE—must comply or face penalties ($2,970 × 30 employees = $89,100/year if don't offer coverage)

---

### Form 1095-C (ACA Reporting)

**Who Receives**: All full-time employees (≥30 hours/week averaged over year)

**Content**: Documents coverage offered (plan name, employee premium, months covered—IRS uses to verify employer compliance + employee uses for tax return if claims marketplace subsidy)

**Distribution**: By January 31 following year (e.g., 2025 coverage → distribute by Jan 31, 2026)

**Filing**: Foundation also files with IRS (Form 1094-C transmittal + 1095-C for each employee—e-file if ≥250 forms)

**Penalty**: $310 per form if fail to file (late or incorrect—e.g., 50 employees = $15,500 penalty if don't file)

**Outsource**: Payroll provider (ADP, Paychex) or benefits admin platform (BambooHR, Zenefits) can auto-generate and file ($5-$10/employee)

---

### ERISA Compliance (Employee Retirement Income Security Act)

**Applies To**: Health, 401(k), life/disability = "employee benefit plans" under ERISA

**Requirements**:

1. **Summary Plan Description (SPD)**: Plain-language document explaining plan (health insurance SPD = insurance carrier provides, 401k SPD = Fidelity provides, Foundation distributes to employees within 90 days of enrollment)
2. **Form 5500**: Annual filing (401k only—health plans exempt if fully insured, not self-funded; due 7 months after plan year-end)
3. **Claims Procedure**: Written process for appealing denied claims (carrier provides for health, 401k provider provides for retirement)
4. **Fiduciary Duty**: Foundation acts as fiduciary (must select plans in employees' best interest, not based on kickbacks or self-dealing—document decision process)

**Penalties**: $100-$1,000/day for SPD failures, $250/day for late Form 5500

---

## Annual Benefits Review & Renewal

### Timeline (August-December)

**August-September: Market Analysis**

- Broker solicits renewal quotes from current carriers (released 60-90 days before Jan 1 effective date)
- Broker also solicits competitive quotes from 3-5 other carriers (benchmark current rates—is Foundation getting best deal?)
- COO reviews quotes with broker (compare premiums, deductibles, networks, disruption to employees if switch carriers)

**October: Decision & Communication**

- Foundation decides: Renew current plans or switch carriers
- If rate increase >10%, negotiate (broker pushes back—"This is excessive, we'll move to competitor if you don't reduce")
- Prepare open enrollment materials (summary of changes, new rates, decision tools)

**November: Open Enrollment**

- Employees enroll (Nov 1-30 window)
- COO tracks completion (send reminders to employees who haven't enrolled)

**December: Finalization**

- COO submits final enrollment file to carriers (by Dec 10—gives carriers 3 weeks to process before Jan 1 effective date)
- Carriers issue new ID cards (mailed Dec 20-30)
- Payroll updated (new premium deductions effective Jan 1)

---

### Rate Increase Benchmarks

**Health Insurance**:

- **Typical Annual Increase**: 5-8% (medical inflation—rising drug costs, hospital prices, utilization)
- **Red Flag**: >15% increase (investigate—did Foundation have high claims? One employee major surgery = $200K claim can spike small-group rates)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Negotiate with broker (threaten to switch carriers)
  - Shift more cost to employees (increase employee premium share 20% → 25%, or increase deductible)
  - Switch to HDHP (lower premiums, higher deductibles—saves Foundation 10-20%)
  - Level-funded or self-funded (Year 3+—Foundation assumes claims risk, can save 10-20% if healthy population)

**401(k)**:

- **Typical Annual Increase**: 0-3% (investment fees declining due to competition—Fidelity, Vanguard fighting for market share)
- **Review Annually**: Are fund expense ratios <0.50%? (Target-date funds should be 0.10-0.30%, index funds <0.10%)

| **Average 401(k) Deferral Rate**   | >6% (maximize match)       | TBD                 | 5-7% typical                                                  |
| **Benefits Cost per Employee**     | <$12,000/year (Year 1)     | TBD                 | $10K-$15K typical small nonprofit                             |
| **Benefits as % of Payroll**       | 20-25%                     | TBD                 | 30-40% for-profit, 15-25% nonprofit                           |
| **EAP Utilization**                | >10% of employees/year     | TBD                 | 3-8% typical (underutilized)                                  |
| **Open Enrollment Completion**     | 100% by deadline           | TBD                 | 85-95% on time (rest need reminders)                          |
| **FSA Forfeitures**                | <10% of contributions      | TBD                 | 15-20% typical (educate employees to avoid over-contributing) |

---

## Conclusion: Benefits = Investment in People

**Foundation's Benefits Philosophy Recap**:

- ✅ **Competitive**: Attract top talent (health, retirement, life/disability = baseline expectation)
- ✅ **Compliant**: Avoid penalties (ACA, ERISA, COBRA—outsource complexity to brokers/TPAs)
- ✅ **Cost-Effective**: Negotiate aggressively (broker leverage, nonprofit discounts, FSA tax savings)
- ✅ **Employee-Valued**: Communicate frequently (annual enrollment not enough—quarterly reminders, one-on-one support)

**ROI of Strong Benefits**:

- **Retention**: Replacing employee = 50-200% of salary (recruiting, onboarding, lost productivity)—strong benefits reduce turnover 10-20%
- **Productivity**: Healthy, financially secure employees = fewer sick days, higher engagement
- **Recruitment**: "We offer health insurance + 401k match" = differentiator vs. small nonprofits that don't

**"Benefits aren't a cost—they're an investment in the mission. Healthy, supported staff deliver healthier, more supported patients."**
