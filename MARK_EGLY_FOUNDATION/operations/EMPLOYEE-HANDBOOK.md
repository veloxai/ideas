Named in honor of Mark Egly, a tireless AATD advocate who passed away in 2024, the Foundation carries forward his vision of a world where every person with Alpha-1 is diagnosed, supported, and hopeful.

### Our Values

- **Scientific Rigor**: We base programs on evidence, data, and best practices
- **Collaboration**: We partner with researchers, clinicians, industry, and patient organizations
- **Transparency**: We operate with integrity, accountability, and openness
- **Compassion**: We meet patients and families with empathy, respect, and cultural humility
- **Innovation**: We embrace new ideas, technologies, and approaches to accelerate progress

### Equal Opportunity Employer

The Mark Egly Foundation is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We do not discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), national origin, age, disability, genetic information, veteran status, or any other legally protected characteristic. This policy applies to all employment practices: recruitment, hiring, compensation, benefits, promotion, training, discipline, and termination.

## Employment Basics

### Employment Categories

**Full-Time Employees**: Work 40 hours/week (or 37.5 hours/week with unpaid lunch). Eligible for all benefits (health insurance, 401(k), PTO).

**Part-Time Employees**: Work <30 hours/week. Eligible for prorated PTO; health insurance eligibility varies by state law and hours worked (ACA threshold: 30 hours/week average).

**Exempt (Salaried)**: Not eligible for overtime pay under FLSA. Typical roles: Executive Director, Directors, Managers, Professional staff (requires salary >$684/week and duties test).

**Non-Exempt (Hourly)**: Eligible for overtime pay (1.5× regular rate for hours >40/week). Typical roles: Administrative Assistants, Coordinators, part-time staff.

**Temporary/Contract**: Fixed-term (e.g., 6-month grant-funded position). Not eligible for benefits unless specified in offer letter.

**Interns**: Unpaid or paid (paid interns = minimum wage + overtime if non-exempt). Educational credit arrangements must comply with DOL intern test.

---

### At-Will Employment

Employment is **at-will** (except where prohibited by state law or modified by individual contract). Either party may terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice. This Handbook does not create a contract of employment—only a written, signed employment agreement can modify at-will status.

---

### Onboarding & Orientation

**Pre-Start (Offer Acceptance to Day 1)**:

- Background check completed (criminal, employment verification, degree verification where applicable)
- I-9 employment eligibility verification (bring documents Day 1: passport or driver's license + Social Security card/birth certificate)
- Benefits enrollment forms (health, dental, 401(k)—due by Day 10 or wait until next open enrollment)

**Day 1**:

- IT setup (laptop, phone, email, 1Password, access provisioning—2-4 hours)
- Mission orientation (ED or COO—Foundation history, programs, goals—1 hour)

---

### Probationary Period

**Duration**: First 90 days of employment

**Purpose**: Mutual evaluation period (Foundation assesses fit; employee assesses role/culture)

**During Probation**:

- Employee may be terminated without progressive discipline (at-will applies)
- Employee eligible for PTO accrual but encouraged to delay use until after probation (ensures adequate coverage if not retained)
- Performance feedback at 30, 60, 90 days (informal check-ins, not formal review)

**Post-Probation**: Employment continues (still at-will); employee fully integrated into team; eligible for merit increases at annual review

---

## Compensation & Work Hours

### Pay Practices

**Pay Schedule**: Bi-weekly (every other Friday—26 pay periods/year)

**Pay Periods**: Work performed Monday Week 1 through Sunday Week 2 → paid Friday Week 3 (1-week lag ensures accurate timesheet submission and payroll processing)

**Direct Deposit**: Required (provide bank routing and account number). Paper checks available only if direct deposit not feasible (e.g., new employee without US bank account—temporary, switch to direct deposit within 30 days)

**Payroll Deductions**:

- Federal income tax (W-4 withholding)
- State income tax (where applicable—Ohio withholding)
- FICA (Social Security 6.2%, Medicare 1.45%—automatic)

- Garnishments (if court-ordered—child support, tax liens)

---

### Timekeeping (Non-Exempt Employees)

**Time Tracking**: Clock in/out daily via Asana time tracking or Google Sheet (IT to implement time-tracking system Year 2—until then, honor system with supervisor approval)

**Rounding**: Time rounded to nearest 15 minutes (7 minutes or less rounds down, 8 minutes or more rounds up—neutral method, complies with FLSA)

**Meal Breaks**: 30-60 minutes unpaid lunch (non-exempt must clock out—paid for work time only)

**Rest Breaks**: Two 15-minute paid breaks (one mid-morning, one mid-afternoon—optional, not required to clock out)

**Overtime**: Must be pre-approved by supervisor. Unauthorized overtime subject to discipline (Foundation pays but counsels employee on budget management)

**Timesheet Approval**: Submit by Monday 9am following end of pay period. Supervisor approves by Tuesday 9am (Finance processes payroll Tuesday-Thursday, pays Friday)

---

### Work Hours & Schedules

**Standard Schedule**:

- **Full-Time**: Monday–Friday, 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM (40 hours/week, includes 1-hour unpaid lunch = 8-hour workday)
- **Core Hours**: 10:00 AM – 3:00 PM (all staff expected to be available for meetings, collaboration)
- **Flexible Hours**: Arrive 8:00–10:00 AM, depart 4:00–6:00 PM (with supervisor approval—accommodate childcare, appointments, etc.)

**Remote Work**: See Remote Work Policy (separate document). Hybrid schedule available for most roles (2-3 days in office, 2-3 days remote—role-dependent)

**Compressed Work Week**: Not offered Year 1 (may consider 4×10 schedule Year 2+ if operationally feasible)

---

### Overtime (Non-Exempt Only)

**Federal Law (FLSA)**: Overtime = 1.5× regular rate for hours >40 in workweek

**Foundation Policy**: Overtime must be pre-approved by supervisor (submit request 48 hours in advance except emergencies—e.g., year-end campaign crunch, urgent patient crisis)

**Compensatory Time**: Not offered (private nonprofits must pay cash overtime per FLSA—comp time only allowed for government employers)

**Holiday Work**: If non-exempt works on holiday, paid holiday pay (8 hours straight time) PLUS 1.5× for hours worked (double-time effective rate)

---

## Time Off & Leave Policies

### Paid Time Off (PTO)

**Accrual-Based System** (combined vacation, sick, personal time—employee chooses how to use)

**Accrual Rates** (Starts Day 1, usable after 90-day probation):

| **Tenure**     | **Annual Accrual**  | **Per Pay Period** (26 periods) | **Notes**                        |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Years 0-2**  | 15 days (120 hours) | 4.62 hours                      | Industry standard for nonprofits |
| **Years 3-5**  | 18 days (144 hours) | 5.54 hours                      | Retention incentive              |
| **Years 6-10** | 21 days (168 hours) | 6.46 hours                      | Senior staff reward              |
| **Years 11+**  | 25 days (200 hours) | 7.69 hours                      | Long-term tenure recognition     |

**Part-Time**: Prorated by hours worked (e.g., 20 hours/week = 50% of full-time accrual)

**Carryover**: Maximum 40 hours/year (use-it-or-lose-it after that—encourages work-life balance, prevents burnout). Carryover hours must be used by March 31 following year.

**Payout at Termination**: Unused PTO paid out at final rate of pay (up to 80 hours max payout—encourages taking time off, limits financial liability)

---

### PTO Request & Approval

**How to Request**:

1. Email supervisor with dates, duration, reason (optional—"vacation," "sick," "personal" for planning purposes but not required to disclose details)
2. Supervisor approves (typically within 48 hours)
3. Log in Google Calendar (shared team calendar—transparency for coverage)

**Approval Criteria**:

- **Advance Notice**: 2 weeks for vacations >3 consecutive days; 24 hours for single days (sick leave = no advance notice required, call/email morning of)
- **Business Needs**: Peak periods (year-end fundraising campaign Nov-Dec, annual conference) may limit time off—requests during blackout periods require ED/COO approval
- **Coverage**: Ensure responsibilities covered (delegate tasks, out-of-office email auto-responder, backup contact designated)

**Denial**: Rare but possible if multiple team members request same week, critical project deadline, or inadequate coverage. Supervisor works with employee to find alternative dates.

---

### Holidays (Paid)

**11 Paid Holidays/Year**:

1. New Year's Day (January 1)
2. Martin Luther King Jr. Day (3rd Monday in January)
3. Presidents' Day (3rd Monday in February)

5. Juneteenth (June 19)
6. Independence Day (July 4)

8. Thanksgiving Day (4th Thursday in November)
9. Day after Thanksgiving (Friday)
10. Christmas Eve (December 24)
11. Christmas Day (December 25)

**Floating Holidays**: 2 days/year (use for religious observance, personal significance, or additional vacation—request like PTO, no carryover)

**Holiday on Weekend**: If holiday falls on Saturday, observed Friday before. If Sunday, observed Monday after.

**Holiday During PTO**: If holiday occurs during your vacation, holiday does NOT count against PTO (e.g., week-long vacation includes July 4 = only 4 PTO days deducted, not 5)

---

### Sick Leave

**Integrated with PTO** (no separate sick bank—PTO covers vacation + sick time)

**Sick Leave Uses**:

- Personal illness or injury
- Medical/dental appointments
- Family member care (child, spouse, parent—under FMLA if >3 consecutive days)
- Mental health days (Foundation recognizes mental health = health—no stigma, use PTO as needed)

**Calling In Sick**:

- Notify supervisor by 9:00 AM day of (or as soon as reasonably possible if emergency)
- No doctor's note required for <3 consecutive days
- Doctor's note required for ≥3 consecutive days (FMLA paperwork if >3 days or recurring condition)

**Sick Leave Abuse**: Pattern of Monday/Friday absences or absences after PTO denial = subject to investigation, discipline

---

### Family & Medical Leave (FMLA)

**How to Request**: Notify COO 30 days in advance (or as soon as practicable). Complete FMLA paperwork, obtain medical certification.

---

### Parental Leave

**Eligibility**: Completed 90-day probation

**Timing**: Must be taken within 12 months of birth/placement (not necessarily consecutive—can split into 2×3-week blocks if approved by COO for operational reasons)

---

### Military Leave

**Federal Law (USERRA)**: Unpaid leave for military service (up to 5 years cumulative). Job protection, benefits continuation (if employee pays premiums), reemployment rights.

**Foundation Supplement**: Up to 2 weeks/year paid differential (if military pay < Foundation pay, Foundation pays difference—support for Reservists/National Guard)

## Workplace Conduct & Standards

### Code of Conduct

All employees expected to:

- **Act with Integrity**: Honest, ethical, transparent in all dealings (donors, patients, partners, colleagues, vendors)
- **Respect Others**: Treat all with dignity, courtesy, professionalism (no bullying, gossip, harassment)
- **Protect Confidentiality**: Patient PHI, donor information, proprietary Foundation data = confidential (HIPAA, state laws, ethical obligation)
- **Avoid Conflicts of Interest**: Disclose any personal, financial, or professional relationships that could conflict with Foundation duties (see Conflict of Interest Policy)
- **Use Resources Responsibly**: Foundation equipment, funds, time used for business purposes (incidental personal use acceptable—e.g., brief personal call, lunch-hour Amazon order—but not excessive)

---

### Dress Code

**Business Casual** (office days):

- **Acceptable**: Khakis, chinos, slacks, skirts (knee-length or longer), blouses, button-downs, sweaters, closed-toe shoes
- **Unacceptable**: Jeans (except Fridays), shorts, tank tops, flip-flops, athletic wear (unless Foundation-branded for event), revealing or offensive clothing

**Casual Fridays**: Jeans allowed (neat, no holes), Foundation t-shirt or polo encouraged

**Patient-Facing Events** (conferences, support groups): Business professional (suit, dress, blazer—represent Foundation credibly)

**Remote Work**: No dress code (pajamas acceptable on video-off calls, but business-appropriate attire for video meetings with external partners)

---

### Attendance & Punctuality

**Expectations**: Arrive on time (9:00 AM or agreed flex time), ready to work. Frequent tardiness disrupts team, reflects poorly on commitment.

**Late Arrival**:

- **Occasional** (traffic, childcare emergency): Notify supervisor by text/call, make up time if non-exempt
- **Pattern** (>3 times/month): Counseling, may lead to performance improvement plan or termination

**Unexcused Absence**: Failure to call/email supervisor = no-call/no-show. 1st offense: written warning. 2nd offense: suspension. 3rd offense: termination.

---

### Workplace Safety

**Office Safety**:

- Keep walkways clear (no trip hazards—boxes, cables, bags)
- Report hazards immediately (broken chair, flickering lights, water leak)
- Know emergency exits and rally point (fire drill annually)

**Ergonomics**: Foundation provides ergonomic keyboard, mouse, monitor stand, adjustable chair upon request (submit to COO—no approval needed, health priority)

**Injury Reporting**: Report work-related injuries immediately to COO (even minor—cut, strain). Workers' compensation insurance covers medical costs, lost wages if injury prevents work.

---

### Substance Abuse

**Drug-Free Workplace**: Foundation prohibits use, possession, or distribution of illegal drugs or unauthorized controlled substances on Foundation property, at Foundation events, or during work hours.

**Alcohol**: Permitted at Foundation social events (holiday party, donor receptions) in moderation. Intoxication = grounds for discipline. Driving under influence using Foundation vehicle or during work = immediate termination.

**Marijuana**: Illegal under federal law (Foundation subject to federal grants, HIPAA—Schedule I drug prohibition applies). Even if legal in state (Ohio medical marijuana = legal 2023), prohibited during work hours or on Foundation property.

**Prescription Drugs**: Legal if prescribed to employee. If medication impairs ability (e.g., opioids post-surgery), notify supervisor (accommodation may be needed—modified duties, temporary leave).

**Testing**: Pre-employment drug screening not required Year 1 (may implement Year 2-3 for safety-sensitive positions—driving, handling patient samples). Post-accident testing if reasonable suspicion (e.g., workplace injury + signs of impairment).

**Assistance**: Employees with substance abuse issues encouraged to seek help via EAP (confidential, no discipline if self-report and seek treatment before performance issues). Refusal to seek treatment after positive test = termination.

---

## Anti-Discrimination & Harassment

### Equal Employment Opportunity

Foundation does not discriminate based on:

- Race, color, ethnicity, national origin
- Sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression
- Sexual orientation
- Pregnancy, childbirth, related conditions
- Religion, creed
- Age (40+)
- Disability (physical, mental)
- Genetic information
- Veteran or military status
- Any other legally protected characteristic (federal, state, local laws)

Applies to: hiring, promotion, compensation, benefits, training, discipline, termination, and all terms/conditions of employment.

---

### Harassment Prevention

**Prohibited Conduct**:

- **Sexual Harassment**: Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, verbal/physical conduct of sexual nature (quid pro quo: "sleep with me or you're fired"; hostile environment: repeated sexual jokes, inappropriate touching, leering)
- **Discriminatory Harassment**: Offensive remarks, jokes, slurs based on protected characteristics (race, religion, disability, etc.) creating hostile work environment
- **Bullying**: Repeated mistreatment (verbal abuse, sabotage, intimidation, humiliation)
- **Retaliation**: Adverse action against employee for reporting harassment, discrimination, or participating in investigation (retaliation = separate violation, equally prohibited)

**Examples of Harassment**:

- Sexual comments about appearance, body, clothing
- Sharing sexual images, jokes, memes (email, Slack, text)
- Unwanted physical contact (hugs, shoulder rubs, standing too close)
- Romantic/sexual advances after being told "no"
- Racial jokes, ethnic slurs, mocking accents
- Religious ridicule or proselytizing (pressuring to convert)
- Disability mockery ("you're so OCD," "that's retarded")

**NOT Harassment**:

- Constructive feedback ("Your report had errors—please proofread")
- Performance management (written warnings, PIP)
- Interpersonal conflict (disagreement over project approach—resolve professionally)
- Single offensive comment (may be inappropriate but not legally "harassment" unless severe—e.g., one-time racial slur = immediate discipline but not hostile environment unless repeated)

---

### Reporting & Investigation

**How to Report**:

1. **Supervisor**: First option (if supervisor not involved in complaint)
2. **COO**: If supervisor involved, or uncomfortable reporting to supervisor
3. **Board Chair**: If COO involved (email boardchair@markeglyfoundation.org)
4. **Anonymous Hotline**: (Year 2-3) Third-party hotline (EthicsPoint, Navex—$1K-$2K/year)

**Report Format**: Verbal or written (written preferred for documentation—email, Google Form). Include: who, what, when, where, witnesses.

**Investigation**:

- Initiated within 48 hours of report
- Investigator (COO or external HR consultant if conflict) interviews complainant, accused, witnesses
- Confidentiality maintained (only those who need to know—investigator, COO, legal, accused)
- Completed within 30 days (or as soon as reasonably possible)

**Outcome**:

- **Substantiated**: Discipline up to termination (severity-dependent—single inappropriate joke = warning; groping = immediate termination)
- **Unsubstantiated**: Insufficient evidence (doesn't mean false—just can't prove by preponderance of evidence)
- **False Report**: Intentionally false report = discipline (rare—most reports made in good faith even if not substantiated)

**Retaliation Prohibition**: Reporting, participating in investigation = protected activity. Any retaliation (demotion, exclusion, cold shoulder) = separate violation, subject to discipline.

---

### Conflict Resolution

**Informal Resolution** (Encouraged First Step):

- Direct conversation: "When you interrupted me in that meeting, I felt dismissed. Can we discuss how to collaborate better?"
- Mediation: COO facilitates conversation between parties (voluntary, confidential)

**Formal Grievance**: If informal fails or complaint serious (harassment, discrimination), file formal complaint (see Dispute Resolution section 13)

---

## Health, Safety & Security

### COVID-19 & Infectious Disease

**Foundation Policy** (Updated as CDC/OSHA guidance evolves):

- **Vaccination**: Encouraged but not required (may require if federal contracts mandate—e.g., CMS contracts require healthcare workers vaccinated)
- **Sick Stay Home**: Symptoms of contagious illness (fever, cough, vomiting) = stay home until symptom-free 24 hours (no PTO penalty for COVID isolation—federal Emergency Paid Sick Leave expired but Foundation voluntarily provides up to 80 hours paid if employee tests positive)
- **Masks**: Optional in office unless outbreak (local transmission = high → masks required in common areas)
- **Remote Work**: Available if immunocompromised or high-risk (accommodation under ADA)

---

### Workplace Violence Prevention

**Zero Tolerance**: Threats, intimidation, physical violence = immediate termination + police involvement

**Warning Signs** (Report to COO Immediately):

- Threats ("I'll hurt you," "You'll regret this," "I'm bringing my gun tomorrow")
- Aggressive behavior (throwing objects, punching walls, shoving)
- Stalking, following, unwanted contact outside work
- Possession of weapons (firearms, knives—prohibited on Foundation property except lawfully licensed concealed carry where legal, but Foundation may restrict as private employer)

**Active Shooter**: Run-Hide-Fight protocol (training annually via online module + live drill)

---

### Security

**Building Access**: Key card or key issued to employees (do not share, report lost keys immediately)

**Visitor Policy**: Visitors must sign in (name, organization, purpose, time in/out), escorted by employee (do not leave visitors unattended—patient data visible on screens, in files)

**After-Hours Access**: Notify COO if working after 7 PM or weekends (security concern—buddy system encouraged)

---

## Technology & Data Use

### Acceptable Use Policy

**Foundation Technology** (laptops, phones, email, internet):

- **Primary Use**: Business purposes
- **Incidental Personal Use**: Acceptable (brief personal email, online banking during lunch, emergency family call)
- **Prohibited Use**:
  - Accessing, downloading, storing, or transmitting illegal content (pirated software, illegal pornography)
  - Excessive personal use (streaming Netflix all day, online shopping for hours)
  - Harassment or discrimination (sending offensive emails, memes)
  - Unauthorized disclosure of confidential information (emailing donor list to personal account, photographing patient records)

**Monitoring**: Foundation reserves right to monitor email, internet use, computer activity (no expectation of privacy on Foundation devices). Monitoring done for security, compliance, not routine surveillance (e.g., investigate suspected data breach, not daily reading of emails).

---

### Social Media Policy

**Personal Social Media**:

- **Allowed**: Post about Foundation (proud to work here, celebrating patient milestone, sharing Foundation's public content)
- **Required Disclaimer**: If identify as Foundation employee, include "Views my own, not Foundation's" (protects Foundation from liability for personal opinions)
- **Prohibited**:
  - Disclosing confidential info (patient stories without permission, unreleased grant announcement, internal financials)
  - Harassing colleagues, patients, donors online
  - Posting illegal, offensive, or discriminatory content associated with Foundation (e.g., racist rant while profile says "Works at Mark Egly Foundation" = discipline)

**Foundation Social Media Accounts** (Official Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn):

- Only authorized staff post (Communications Director, ED)
- Pre-approval required for controversial topics (political endorsements prohibited—jeopardize 501(c)(3) status)

---

### Data Protection & HIPAA

**Patient Health Information (PHI)**: Protected under HIPAA (see HIPAA Implementation Playbook for details)

**Key Rules**:

- **Minimum Necessary**: Access only PHI needed for your job (patient navigator = yes; accountant = no)
- **Secure Communication**: PHI emailed only if encrypted (Google Workspace = TLS encryption—acceptable) or via secure portal (REDCap)
- **No Public Disclosure**: Don't discuss patients in public (elevator, coffee shop, social media)
- **Device Security**: Laptop encrypted, password-protected, locked when unattended
- **Report Breaches**: Suspected breach (email to wrong recipient, laptop stolen) = report to COO immediately (legally required—HHS notification within 60 days if >500 patients, breach log if <500)

**Donor Data**: Not HIPAA-protected but ethically confidential (donor names, contact info, donation amounts = proprietary—do not share outside Foundation without donor permission)

---

### Email & Communication

## Performance & Development

### Performance Review Cycle

**Annual Review**:

- **Timing**: Each employee's anniversary month (hire September → reviewed each September)
- **Process**: Self-assessment (employee completes form—accomplishments, challenges, goals) → Supervisor review → Meeting (1-2 hours—discuss performance, goals, development) → Rating + compensation decision

**Ratings**:

- **Exceptional (5%)**: Far exceeds expectations, transformational impact
- **Exceeds (15%)**: Consistently above expectations, high impact
- **Meets (70%)**: Solid performance, meets all key responsibilities
- **Needs Improvement (8%)**: Some gaps, requires support (may trigger PIP)
- **Unsatisfactory (2%)**: Fails to meet expectations (typically leads to termination unless drastic improvement)

**Merit Increases**:

- **Exceptional**: 5-7% raise
- **Exceeds**: 3-5% raise
- **Meets**: 2-3% raise (cost-of-living adjustment)
- **Needs Improvement**: 0% raise (freeze until improvement)
- **Unsatisfactory**: 0% raise, likely termination

---

### Quarterly Check-Ins

**Informal Progress Reviews** (15-30 minutes, don't wait for annual review):

- Discuss goals, obstacles, support needed
- Real-time feedback (celebrate wins, course-correct issues)

---

### Professional Development Plan

**Annual Development Goals** (Set during performance review):

- **Skill Development**: What to learn this year? (e.g., grant writing, data analysis, public speaking)
- **Career Pathing**: Where do you want to be in 3-5 years? (Foundation supports internal promotions—develop talent)
- **Resources**: Conferences, courses, mentorship, stretch assignments

---

## Disciplinary Procedures

### Progressive Discipline

**Philosophy**: Corrective, not punitive (goal = improve performance, retain talent—not "gotcha")

**Steps**:

1. **Verbal Counseling** (First offense, minor issue—late to meeting, missed deadline): Supervisor discusses issue, documents conversation in employee file
2. **Written Warning** (Repeated issue or moderate severity—pattern of tardiness, subpar work quality): Formal write-up, employee signs acknowledgment (signature = receipt, not agreement), placed in personnel file
3. **Final Written Warning** (Continued issues): Last chance—states specific improvement required, timeline (e.g., 30 days), consequence if not met (termination)
4. **Termination** (Failure to improve or severe violation)

**Exceptions (Immediate Termination—No Progressive Discipline)**:

- Gross misconduct: Theft, violence, sexual harassment, fraud, intoxication at work, HIPAA breach (intentional disclosure of PHI)
- Insubordination: Refusal to perform lawful, reasonable job duty
- Falsification: Timesheet fraud, resume lies, forged documents

---

### Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)

**When Used**: Performance deficiencies (not behavioral—e.g., missing targets, poor quality work, low productivity)

**PIP Structure**:

- **Performance Gaps**: Specific deficiencies (e.g., "Missed 3 grant deadlines in Q3, submitted report with 15 errors")
- **Improvement Goals**: Measurable (e.g., "Submit all Q4 grant proposals on time with <2 errors per document")
- **Support Provided**: Training, mentorship, resources, more frequent check-ins
- **Timeline**: 30-90 days (complexity-dependent)
- **Outcome**:
  - **Success**: Goals met → remove from PIP, continue employment (may still affect annual review rating)
  - **Partial**: Some improvement → extend PIP 30 days or move to final warning
  - **Failure**: Goals not met → termination

---

## Separation & Termination

### Voluntary Resignation

**Notice Required**: 2 weeks minimum (4 weeks preferred for senior roles—ED, Directors—allows knowledge transfer, hiring search)

**Resignation Process**:

1. Submit written resignation (email to supervisor + COO—include last day, brief reason optional)
2. Exit interview (COO meets with departing employee—gather feedback, discuss unused PTO payout, benefits continuation)
3. Offboarding (see Offboarding & Exit Procedures document—system access revoked, equipment returned, final paycheck)

**Payout**: Unused PTO paid (up to 80 hours max) in final paycheck

---

### Involuntary Termination

**Termination for Cause**:

- Gross misconduct (immediate—escorted out, no notice pay)
- Performance (after PIP failure—typically effective immediately or 1-week notice if transitioning critical work)
- Layoff/RIF (see below)

**Termination Meeting**:

- Conducted by supervisor + COO (witness, HR documentation)
- Brief, respectful (10-15 minutes—deliver decision, explain reason, outline next steps—no debate)
- Provide termination letter (signed by ED, states effective date, reason, final pay details, COBRA info)

**Final Pay**: Due by next regular payday (or immediately if required by state law—check Ohio wage payment laws)

---

### Layoff / Reduction in Force (RIF)

**Criteria**: Business needs (budget shortfall, grant loss, program closure, restructuring—not performance-based)

**Selection**: Non-discriminatory (seniority, elimination of position, skill set redundancy—document rationale to avoid disparate impact claims)

**Notice**: 2-4 weeks if possible (not required unless WARN Act applies—Foundation <100 employees = exempt Year 1-2, may apply Year 3+)

**Severance** (Discretionary, Foundation provides when budget permits):

- **1 week pay per year of service** (max 8 weeks—e.g., 5-year employee = 5 weeks severance)
- **Severance agreement**: Employee signs release of claims (waives right to sue for wrongful termination—consult attorney before signing)

**Benefits Continuation**: COBRA offered (employee can continue health insurance at own cost—see below)

---

### COBRA (Health Insurance Continuation)

**Who**: Terminated employees (voluntary or involuntary, except gross misconduct), reduced hours (<30/week), dependents after divorce/death

**Duration**: 18 months (63 months if disabled)

**Cost**: Employee pays 102% of premium (full cost + 2% admin fee—expensive but cheaper than individual market often)

**Election**: 60 days to elect COBRA (Foundation sends notice within 14 days of termination, employee decides by day 60)

---

### References

**Foundation Policy**: HR/COO provides only employment verification (dates of employment, title, salary if requested—neutral facts)

**Supervisor Personal References**: Supervisor may provide personal reference (not speaking for Foundation—e.g., LinkedIn recommendation, phone call from prospective employer) but must clarify "personal opinion, not official Foundation statement"

**Defamation Risk**: Avoid negative references (even if true—e.g., "fired for poor performance"—can lead to lawsuit; if must decline reference, say "Foundation policy, I can't provide reference")

---

## Dispute Resolution

### Internal Grievance Process

**Step 1: Informal Resolution** (Encouraged):

- Discuss directly with person involved (most conflicts = misunderstandings, resolved through conversation)
- Involve supervisor as mediator (facilitates dialogue)

**Step 2: Formal Grievance**:

- Submit written complaint to COO (include: issue, desired resolution, supporting evidence)
- COO investigates (interviews, reviews documents—within 30 days)
- COO issues decision (written response—uphold complaint, partial remedy, or deny)

**Step 3: Appeal**:

- If unsatisfied, appeal to ED (within 10 days of COO decision)
- ED reviews, may conduct additional investigation
- ED decision = final (internal process exhausted)

**Step 4: External Options** (If internal process fails):

- **EEOC Complaint** (discrimination, harassment—file within 180-300 days of incident, depending on state)
- **Department of Labor** (wage/hour violations, FMLA violations)
- **State Agency** (Ohio Civil Rights Commission for state law claims)
- **Private Attorney** (wrongful termination, breach of contract—consult employment lawyer)

---

### Arbitration

**No Mandatory Arbitration** (Year 1): Foundation does not require arbitration agreements (employees retain right to sue in court or file EEOC complaints)

**Future Consideration** (Year 3+): May introduce arbitration for employment disputes (common in healthcare, reduces legal costs—but controversial, some states restrict). If implemented, voluntary and compensated (Foundation pays arbitration fees, employee keeps right to EEOC filing).
