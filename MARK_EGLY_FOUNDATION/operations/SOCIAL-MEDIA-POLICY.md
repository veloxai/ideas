## Social Media Philosophy

### Foundation's Social Media Mission

**Goal**: Build vibrant online community where AATD patients, caregivers, researchers, and advocates connect, learn, share experiences, and drive awareness—ultimately improving diagnosis rates and patient outcomes.

**Core Values**:

**1. Community-First**
- Social media is conversation, not broadcast—listen as much as post
- Amplify patient voices (share their stories, celebrate milestones)
- Respond to every comment/message within 24 hours (show people matter)

**2. Authentic & Human**
- Foundation has personality—warm, hopeful, evidence-based (not corporate/sterile)
- Use real photos (patients, staff, events), not stock images
- Admit mistakes, show behind-the-scenes (transparency builds trust)

**3. Educational & Empowering**
- Every post should teach something (AATD facts, self-advocacy tips, research updates)
- Empower patients with knowledge (genetic testing, treatment options, clinical trials)
- Translate science into plain language (no jargon)

**4. Inclusive & Representative**
- Reflect AATD community diversity (age, race, gender, geography, disease severity)
- Accessible content (alt text for images, captions for videos)
- Multiple languages (Spanish, if budget allows—10% U.S. Hispanic AATD patients)

**5. Ethical & Compliant**
- HIPAA-compliant (never share patient info without explicit consent)
- FTC-compliant (disclose partnerships, avoid medical advice)
- Platform terms of service (no spamming, impersonation, hate speech)

### Platform Decision Matrix

| **Platform** | **Audience Fit** | **Content Type** | **Resource Need** | **Priority** |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| Facebook     | ✅ Excellent (core demographic) | Text, images, video, events | Medium | **Primary** |
| Twitter/X    | ✅ Excellent (professional, advocacy) | Text, links, live updates | Low | **Primary** |
| LinkedIn     | ✅ Good (donors, partners) | Professional content | Low | **Primary** |
| Instagram    | ⚠️ Moderate (younger patients) | Photos, Stories | Medium-High | Secondary |
| YouTube      | ✅ Good (education, SEO) | Video production | High | Secondary |
| TikTok       | ⚠️ Low (not core demographic yet) | Short video | Medium | Experimental |
| Threads      | ⚠️ Unknown (new platform) | Text-based | Low | Monitor |

---

## Content Strategy & Pillars

### Content Pillars (80/20 Rule)

**80% Mission Content** (Serves AATD community):

**Step 4: Revisions** (If requested, revise within 24 hours)
**Step 5: Final Approval** (Approver marks "Approved" in calendar)
**Step 6: Schedule** (Load into social media scheduler or post manually)

**Emergency Fast-Track** (Crisis, time-sensitive): ED can approve on phone/email, document retroactively.

---

## Personal vs. Organizational Accounts

### Staff Personal Accounts

**Policy**: Staff can have personal social media accounts—Foundation respects free speech—but must follow guidelines when mentioning Foundation or AATD.

**Guidelines**:
1. **Identify affiliation** (in bio: "Personal views, not my employer's")
2. **Don't claim to speak for Foundation** (unless authorized spokesperson)
3. **Respect confidentiality** (no patient info, internal discussions, proprietary data)
4. **Avoid conflicts** (don't publicly criticize Foundation, Board, donors, partners)
5. **Use good judgment** (avoid inflammatory political posts that could reflect poorly on Foundation)

**Enforcement**: First violation = verbal warning (ED), second = written warning, third = termination (if egregious—e.g., sharing patient info).

---

### Board Member Social Media

**Encourage Board Amplification**:
- ✅ Share Foundation posts (retweet, repost, share)
- ✅ Post personal stories about why they serve on Board
- ✅ Promote events, fundraising campaigns

**Prohibit**:
- ❌ Speaking on behalf of Foundation without ED approval (Board Chair can, others need permission)
- ❌ Sharing confidential Board discussions (executive session, donor identities, financial specifics)

---

## Employee Social Media Guidelines

### "ABCs of Social Media" (Staff Training)

**A = Authentic**: Be yourself, but represent Foundation's values (empathy, accuracy, inclusivity)
**B = Boundaries**: Separate personal from professional (don't argue politics on Foundation account)
**C = Confidentiality**: HIPAA applies online (never screenshot patient messages, share identifiable info)
**D = Disclosure**: If discussing Foundation, note affiliation ("I work at Mark Egly Foundation, views my own")
**E = Ethics**: Follow FTC guidelines (disclose sponsored posts, affiliate links)

---

### What to Do/Not Do

**DO**:
- ✅ Share Foundation content (helps amplify reach)
- ✅ Correct AATD misinformation (politely, with sources)
- ✅ Celebrate Foundation wins (awards, milestones—after publicly announced)
- ✅ Be kind (even to critics—represent Foundation well)

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Post when angry (drafts cool off overnight)
- ❌ Engage trolls (block/report, don't argue)
- ❌ Guarantee medical outcomes ("Our program will cure you"—false, illegal)
- ❌ Use Foundation accounts for personal opinions (politics, religion—unless org position)

---

### Social Media Clause in Employee Handbook

> **Social Media Policy**
> Employees may maintain personal social media accounts but must:
> - Not disclose confidential information (patient data, internal operations, donor identities)
> - Not claim to represent Foundation without authorization

---

## Engagement Protocols

### Response Guidelines

**Respond Within 24 Hours** (Business Days):
- Comments on posts
- Direct messages
- Mentions/tags

**Response Prioritization**:
1. **Crisis/Urgent** (patient in distress, media inquiry): 2 hours
2. **Routine Questions** (AATD info, program details): 24 hours
3. **Thanks/Positive Feedback** (kudos, appreciation): 48 hours (or like/heart)

---

### Comment Response Scripts

**Positive Comment**:
> Comment: "Thank you for all you do! My husband was just diagnosed and your resources have been lifesaving."
>
> **Foundation Response**: "We're so glad we could help! Welcome to the AATD community—you're not alone. If your husband needs one-on-one support, our patient navigators are here: [link]. ❤️"

**Question**:
> Comment: "How do I get genetic testing for AATD? My doctor doesn't know about it."
>
> **Foundation Response**: "Great question! We have a testing resources page with labs that offer free/low-cost AATD testing: [link]. You can also share this physician guide with your doctor: [link]. Feel free to DM us if you need more help!"

**Criticism** (Constructive):
> Comment: "Your website is hard to navigate—took me 10 minutes to find support group info."
>
> **Foundation Response**: "Thank you for the feedback—we're always looking to improve. We're redesigning our website in Q1 2026 with better navigation. In the meantime, here's direct link to support groups: [link]. Please let us know if you have other suggestions!"

**Trolling/Inappropriate**:
> Comment: "This is a scam charity. They don't help anyone."
>
> **Foundation Response** (ONE polite response, then ignore/block): "We're sorry you feel that way. Last year we served 200 patients with navigation, funded $500K in research, and published financials here: [link]. If you have specific concerns, email us: info@markegly.org."
>
> **Then**: Block user if continued harassment.

---

### When NOT to Respond

**Don't Engage**:
- ❌ Obvious trolls (inflammatory, no substance)
- ❌ Medical advice requests ("Should I stop my medication?"—refer to doctor)
- ❌ Legal advice ("Can I sue my insurer?"—refer to lawyer)
- ❌ Off-topic spam (cryptocurrency, MLM schemes—delete/block)

---

## Privacy & HIPAA Compliance

### HIPAA Rules for Social Media

**Protected Health Information (PHI)** = Name + Health Info

**Never Post Without Written Consent**:
- ❌ "John Smith was diagnosed with AATD and started treatment"—identifies person + condition
- ❌ Screenshots of patient messages (even if name hidden, could be identifiable)
- ❌ Photos of patients at events (faces visible—need photo release)

**OK to Post** (De-identified or Consented):
- ✅ "A 45-year-old patient from Ohio was recently diagnosed"—no identifying info
- ✅ Patient story with written consent + photo release (signed form)
- ✅ Aggregate data ("We served 200 patients this year"—no individuals identified)

---

### Photo & Video Releases

**Consent Form** (Required for All Patient Content):
- Patient name, date, signature
- Specific use ("Foundation may use my photo/story on social media, website, print materials")
- Revocability ("I can withdraw consent anytime by emailing info@markegly.org")
- Privacy options (checkbox: "Use first name only" or "Use initials only")

**Storage**: Digital copies in secure folder (password-protected), linked to patient record.

---

### Minors & Dependents

**If Posting About Children with AATD**:
- **Parental consent required** (both parents if joint custody)
- **Consider child's maturity** (teens 13+ should co-sign consent)
- **Protect identity** (first name only, no school names, avoid identifying tattoos/scars)

---

## Crisis Response on Social Media

### Social Media Crisis Triggers

**Red Flags** (Escalate Immediately):
- 🔴 Viral negative post (patient complaint, donor criticism—1,000+ shares)
- 🔴 Impersonation account (fake Foundation account)
- 🔴 Misinformation spreading (false claims about AATD, Foundation programs)
- 🔴 Coordinated attack (multiple users posting same negative message—could be bots, competitors)
- 🔴 Staff misconduct (employee posts inappropriate content, Foundation tagged)

---

### Crisis Response Protocol

**Immediate Actions** (Within 1 Hour):
1. **Alert ED + Board Chair** (phone/text—don't wait for email)
2. **Screenshot everything** (posts, comments, DMs—evidence for legal if needed)
3. **Consult legal counsel** (before responding if serious—defamation, patient harm claims)
4. **Pause scheduled posts** (don't post cheerful content during crisis)
5. **Monitor 24/7** (Crisis Communication Plan Document 19—assign rotating shifts)

---

### Crisis Response Templates

**Holding Statement** (Buy Time While Investigating):
> "We're aware of [issue] and take it seriously. We're reviewing the matter thoroughly and will provide more information soon. The wellbeing of AATD patients is our top priority."

**Acknowledgment + Action**:
> "We've heard your concerns about [issue]. We're taking the following steps: [1, 2, 3]. We're committed to transparency and will update you by [date]. Thank you for holding us accountable."

**Misinformation Correction**:
> "We've seen misinformation circulating about [topic]. Here are the facts: [1, 2, 3—with sources]. We're committed to science-based information. Full statement: [link]."

---

### What NOT to Do in Crisis

**Avoid**:
- ❌ **Delete criticism** (unless spam/violates platform rules—deleting looks guilty, Streisand effect)
- ❌ **Argue with critics** (defensive, emotional responses escalate—stay professional)
- ❌ **"No comment"** (sounds evasive—use holding statement)
- ❌ **Blame others** ("This is the media's fault"—take responsibility if Foundation erred)
- ❌ **Go silent** (silence interpreted as guilt—communicate frequently, even if limited info)

---

## Metrics Tracking & Analytics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| ----------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- |
| **Total Followers**     | 5,200          | 5,000          | +4%        | 6,000    | ⚠️ Behind  |
| **Engagement Rate**     | 4.2%           | 3.8%           | +11%       | 4%       | ✅ Met     |

**Insights Section** (Narrative):
> "Engagement rate increased 11% due to patient storytelling focus (Sarah's post reached 15K, 200 shares). Donations lagging—need to test Facebook fundraising tools, add 'Donate' CTAs to top posts. Followers growing slower than goal—consider small ad spend ($500/month) to boost page likes."

---

---

## Social Media Advertising

### When to Use Paid Social

**Organic Reach Declining** (Facebook shows posts to only 2-5% of followers—pay to reach more):
- Boost high-performing posts (patient stories with 100+ likes → boost to reach 10K)
- Promote events (gala, walk—target local audiences within 50 miles)
- Awareness campaigns (Rare Disease Day, Alpha-1 Awareness Month—target COPD keywords)

---

### Ad Budget Allocation

**Year 1-2**: $500-$1,000/month ($6,000-$12,000/year)
**Year 3-5**: $1,500-$3,000/month ($18,000-$36,000/year)
**Year 6+**: $3,000-$5,000/month ($36,000-$60,000/year)

**Allocation by Platform** (Year 3 Example—$2,000/month):
- Facebook/Instagram Ads: $1,200 (60%—largest audience)
- LinkedIn Ads: $500 (25%—donor targeting)
- Twitter/X Ads: $300 (15%—research dissemination, policy advocacy)

---

---

### Ad Creative Best Practices

**Facebook/Instagram**:
- ✅ **Video outperforms images** (3× engagement)
- ✅ **Short copy** (125 characters or less—mobile users skim)
- ✅ **Clear CTA** ("Donate Now," "Register Today," "Learn More"—button text)
- ✅ **Captions on video** (85% watch with sound off)

**LinkedIn**:
- ✅ **Professional tone** (less emotional, more data-driven)
- ✅ **Whitepapers/reports** (offer downloadable content—builds email list)
- ✅ **Company targeting** (target pharmaceutical, biotech companies—partnership prospects)

---

## Influencer Partnerships

### What is Influencer Marketing?

**Definition**: Partner with individuals who have large social media followings (10K-1M+) to promote Foundation—they post about AATD, tag Foundation, drive awareness.

**Types**:
- **Micro-Influencers** (10K-100K followers): Health bloggers, patient advocates, nurse influencers
- **Macro-Influencers** (100K-1M followers): Celebrity patients (if any), health journalists
- **Celebrity** (1M+ followers): Rare (expensive, usually requires personal connection)

---

### Foundation's Influencer Strategy

**Year 1-3**: No paid influencer partnerships (budget constraints)—focus on organic partnerships (patient advocates who post voluntarily)

**Year 4+**: Micro-influencer partnerships ($500-$2,000/post or product donation/event sponsorship)

**Selection Criteria**:
- ✅ **Authentic connection** (AATD patient, caregiver, or genuinely passionate about rare disease)
- ✅ **Engaged audience** (2-5% engagement rate—10K followers with 500 likes > 100K followers with 500 likes)
- ✅ **Values alignment** (posts align with Foundation's mission, not controversial)

## Community Management

### Building Online Community

**Goal**: Transform followers into community—active, engaged, supportive (like Facebook group for AATD patients).

**Strategies**:

**1. Facebook Group** (In Addition to Page):
- **"AATD Community" Private Group** (request-to-join, moderated by Foundation staff)
- **Purpose**: Peer support, question-asking, unfiltered sharing (less polished than public page)
- **Moderation**: 2 staff moderators, clear group rules (no medical advice, no sales pitches, kindness)

**2. User-Generated Content (UGC)**:
- **Encourage patients to share stories** ("Post your diagnosis story, tag us #MyAATDStory")
- **Feature UGC on Foundation channels** (with permission—repost, amplify patient voices)
- **Monthly spotlight** ("Patient of the Month"—feature interview, photo)

**3. Live Events**:
- **Facebook Live Q&As** (monthly, 30 minutes, Medical Advisory Board answers questions)
- **Twitter Spaces / LinkedIn Audio** (live audio discussions—less production than video)
- **Instagram Takeovers** (patient "takes over" Foundation account for day—shows their life)

**4. Challenges & Campaigns**:
- **#Alpha1AwarenessChallenge** (March—post AATD fact daily, nominate 3 friends to share)
- **"Get Tested" Campaign** (encourage followers to share genetic testing experience, tag 3 at-risk friends)

### Moderation Guidelines

**Remove/Ban** (Zero Tolerance):
- ❌ Hate speech (racism, sexism, homophobia)
- ❌ Spam (repeated sales pitches, MLM schemes)
- ❌ Medical advice posing as expertise ("Stop your meds, try this herb"—dangerous)
- ❌ Doxxing (posting someone's personal info—address, phone)

**Warning (First Offense, Then Ban)**:
- ⚠️ Excessive profanity (occasional OK in expressing frustration, but not directed at others)
- ⚠️ Off-topic (political rants unrelated to AATD—redirect to topic)
- ⚠️ Self-promotion (plugging personal GoFundMe—once OK, repeatedly = spam)

**Allow** (Even If Uncomfortable):
- ✅ Constructive criticism ("Foundation should do more research funding"—valid feedback)
- ✅ Questions about alternative treatments (answer with evidence-based info, don't dismiss)
- ✅ Emotional venting ("I'm so tired of this disease"—offer support, resources)

## Conclusion

### Social Media as Community Lifeline

**Bottom Line**: For rare disease patients (often geographically isolated), social media = community, support, education. Foundation's social presence isn't marketing fluff—it's lifeline for patients who feel alone.

**Human-First Strategy**: Algorithms change, platforms rise/fall, but authentic human connection endures. Invest in relationships (patients, advocates, partners), tell real stories, show up consistently—community will grow.

**Continuous Evolution**: Social media changes fast (TikTok didn't exist 10 years ago, Threads launched 2023). Stay curious, experiment, learn from failures, double down on what works.
