## Academic Partnership Philosophy

### Why Partner with Academia?

**Foundation Mission**: Improve AATD patient outcomes through research, advocacy, education.

**Reality**: Foundation lacks resources for large-scale research (no lab, limited staff)—but academic institutions have:
- ✅ Research infrastructure (labs, equipment, core facilities)
- ✅ Scientific expertise (pulmonologists, geneticists, bioinformaticians)
- ✅ Patient populations (clinics treating 100+ AATD patients)
- ✅ IRB approval mechanisms (ethical oversight, regulatory compliance)
- ✅ Grant funding (NIH, private foundations—leverage Foundation's seed funding)

**Partnership Logic**: Foundation provides funding, patient access, data, advocacy networks → Academia provides research capacity, scientific rigor, publications → Together, advance AATD knowledge faster than either could alone.

---

### Core Partnership Values

**1. Mission Alignment**
- **Shared goal**: Improve AATD patient lives (not just publish papers for tenure)
- **Patient-centered**: Research questions patients care about (quality of life, symptom management, diagnosis accuracy—not just molecular mechanisms)
- **Translational focus**: Bench-to-bedside pipeline (discoveries → clinical trials → treatments)

**2. Transparency & Trust**
- **Open communication**: Quarterly meetings, honest progress reports (celebrate wins, discuss setbacks)
- **Data access**: Foundation retains right to see de-identified data (verify results, share with community)
- **Financial accountability**: Researchers provide budget reports (ensure Foundation funds used as intended)

**3. Mutual Benefit**
- **Foundation gets**: Scientific advances, publications, patient resources, credibility boost (partnering with Harvard, Stanford enhances reputation)
- **Academia gets**: Funding, patient recruitment pipeline, community engagement, real-world validation (patients use research findings)

**4. Intellectual Property Fairness**
- **Foundation doesn't claim IP unfairly** (researchers did the science, deserve credit)
- **But**: Foundation funds research → entitled to ensure discoveries accessible to AATD patients (not locked behind pharma exclusivity that inflates prices)
- **Balance**: Researchers can patent (incentivizes commercialization), but Foundation retains licensing influence (ensure affordability)

---

## Types of Academic Partnerships

### 1. Sponsored Research Agreements

**Definition**: Foundation pays university to conduct specific research project (Foundation funds = restricted for designated study).

**Example**: Foundation grants $100K to Johns Hopkins to study "Impact of augmentation therapy on AATD patient quality of life—2-year longitudinal study."

**Key Terms**:
- **Scope of work**: Detailed research plan (hypothesis, methods, timeline, deliverables)
- **Budget**: Line-item breakdown (personnel, equipment, supplies, overhead—university charges 10-30% indirect costs)
- **Milestones**: Payment schedule tied to progress (50% upfront, 25% at Year 1 interim report, 25% at final publication)
- **Reporting**: Quarterly progress updates, annual detailed reports
- **IP ownership**: University owns IP, Foundation retains non-exclusive license for patient education use

**Foundation Investment**: $50K-$200K per project (Year 3-5), $200K-$500K (Year 6-10)

---

### 2. Collaborative Research Agreements

**Definition**: Foundation and university co-develop research (both contribute resources—Foundation provides data/patients, university provides lab/expertise).

**Example**: Foundation shares AATD patient registry data (de-identified), University of Pittsburgh analyzes genotype-phenotype correlations, both parties co-author publication.

**Key Terms**:
- **Contributions**: Foundation (patient registry access, $25K funding), University (bioinformatics analysis, statistical modeling, no charge for faculty time)
- **Co-PI structure**: Foundation's Chief Medical Officer and University PI are equal partners (both on publications, grant applications)
- **Data governance**: Joint oversight committee (3 Foundation, 3 University—approve data use, publications)
- **IP ownership**: Jointly owned (both parties must agree on licensing)

**Foundation Investment**: $10K-$50K (Year 2-5), mostly in-kind (data, patient access)

---

### 3. Pilot Grant Programs

**Definition**: Foundation issues competitive RFPs (Request for Proposals)—researchers submit proposals, Foundation funds 3-5 best ideas ($25K-$50K each).

**Example**: "Mark Egly Foundation AATD Research Pilot Grants—$50K awards for innovative early-stage research on AATD diagnosis, treatment, or quality of life."

**Key Terms**:
- **Open competition**: Advertised widely (email to pulmonary societies, posted on Foundation website)
- **Review committee**: Medical Advisory Board + 2 patient representatives score proposals (scientific merit 70%, patient relevance 30%)
- **Award conditions**: 1-year funding, must acknowledge Foundation in publications, must share de-identified data with Foundation registry
- **No IP claims**: Foundation doesn't own IP (pilot grants = seed funding to help researchers get preliminary data for larger NIH grants)

**Foundation Investment**: $100K-$250K/year (Year 4+, when budget allows)

---

### 4. Biobank Collaborations

**Definition**: Foundation collects/stores patient biological samples (blood, DNA, tissue)—researchers request samples for studies (Foundation approves requests, ships samples, charges cost recovery fee).

**Example**: Foundation partners with University of Florida to establish AATD Biobank—1,000 patient samples stored, researchers nationwide can apply for sample access.

**Key Terms**:
- **Sample ownership**: Foundation owns samples (patients consented to donate to Foundation)
- **Access policy**: Researchers submit scientific proposal + IRB approval + funding proof → Foundation Scientific Advisory Committee approves
- **Cost recovery**: $50-$200 per sample (covers processing, storage, shipping—not profit)
- **Publication requirement**: Researchers must publish results (open-access if possible), share findings with Foundation

**Foundation Investment**: $50K-$150K upfront (biobank setup, freezers, sample processing), $20K-$40K annually (maintenance, staff)

---

### 5. Clinical Trial Partnerships

**Definition**: Foundation recruits patients for academic-led clinical trials (Foundation doesn't run trial, but facilitates enrollment—solves #1 trial challenge: patient recruitment).

**Example**: Stanford launches Phase 2 trial of new AATD treatment—Foundation promotes via email, support groups, social media → 50 patients enroll (vs. Stanford's usual 10-15).

**Key Terms**:
- **Recruitment support**: Foundation advertises trial (email blast, website listing, patient navigator calls eligible patients)
- **No financial conflict**: Foundation doesn't receive payment from pharma sponsor (maintains objectivity)
- **Patient advocacy**: Foundation ensures trial designed with patient input (endpoint measures patients care about, visits not overly burdensome)
- **Data sharing**: Foundation receives aggregated trial results (share with community, inform advocacy)

**Foundation Investment**: $5K-$20K per trial (staff time, marketing materials, patient navigator support)

---

## Partnership Identification & Vetting

### How to Find Academic Partners

**Proactive Strategies**:

**1. Conference Networking** (American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society, Rare Disease Conferences):
- Attend AATD-focused sessions, identify researchers presenting cutting-edge work
- ED/CMO approach afterward ("Love your work—could we discuss collaboration?")
- Follow up with email, propose coffee meeting

**2. Literature Review**:
- Search PubMed for "Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency" (filter: last 5 years, high-impact journals)
- Identify prolific AATD researchers (publish 3+ papers/year = active, well-funded)
- Cold email: "We admire your work on [topic]. Mark Egly Foundation funds AATD research—could we schedule call to explore partnership?"

**3. Medical Advisory Board Referrals**:
- MAB members are academic researchers themselves—ask for colleague recommendations
- "Who's doing innovative AATD work we should fund?"

**4. RFP Responses**:
- Issue open RFP (post on Foundation website, email to pulmonary departments at top 50 research universities)
- Researchers come to Foundation (not Foundation chasing them)

---

### Vetting Criteria

**Before partnering, assess**:

**Scientific Credibility**:
- ✅ **Publications**: 10+ peer-reviewed papers (demonstrates research productivity)
- ✅ **Funding history**: Prior NIH grants or foundation funding (shows other funders trust them)
- ✅ **Institutional reputation**: Top-50 research university (infrastructure, IRB quality, legal office experience)

**AATD Expertise**:
- ✅ **Prior AATD research**: Published on AATD before (not first time—learning curve costly)
- ✅ **Patient population**: Clinic treats 50+ AATD patients (can recruit for studies)
- ✅ **Clinical vs. Basic**: Both valuable, but clinical research more immediately translatable

**Alignment with Foundation**:
- ✅ **Patient-centered**: Research addresses patient needs (not just academically interesting)
- ✅ **Collaborative**: Open to Foundation input (doesn't treat Foundation as ATM—wants partnership)
- ✅ **Communication**: Responsive (replies to emails within 1 week, not radio silent)

**Red Flags** (Avoid Partnering):
- 🚩 **No track record**: Never published research (use pilot grants for emerging researchers, not large awards)
- 🚩 **Overpromising**: "This will cure AATD in 2 years" (unrealistic—good scientists cautious)
- 🚩 **Conflicts of interest**: Co-owns company that would profit from research findings (financial bias)
- 🚩 **Poor communication**: Takes weeks to respond, misses meetings (will be worse during collaboration)

- Foundation may use data for patient education, future research, public reports

---

**4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY**

**Ownership**: Institution owns all IP generated from research (inventions, patents, software, data).

**Foundation License**: Institution grants Foundation perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to:
- Use research findings for patient education (fact sheets, webinars)
- Share de-identified data with other researchers (if IRB-approved)
- Include results in Foundation reports, grant applications, advocacy materials

**Commercialization**: If Institution patents invention (e.g., diagnostic test, treatment), Institution will:
- Notify Foundation within 30 days of patent filing
- Negotiate in good faith to ensure AATD patients have affordable access (e.g., licensing to generic manufacturers, not just exclusive Big Pharma deal)
- Acknowledge Foundation funding in patent application

---

**5. PUBLICATION & ACKNOWLEDGMENT**

**Authorship**: Determined by ICMJE criteria (substantial contributions to design, data collection, analysis, or writing).
- Foundation's CMO may be co-author if involved in study design, interpretation (not automatic—earned)
- Acknowledgments section must state: "This research was funded by Mark Egly Foundation."

**Pre-Publication Review**: Institution provides Foundation with manuscript draft 10 business days before submission.
- Foundation may request minor edits (e.g., patient-friendly language summary, accurate Foundation description)
- Foundation may request 30-day publication delay (if patent filing needed, or if results conflict with ongoing Foundation campaign—rare, must justify)
- Foundation will not unreasonably withhold approval

**Open Access**: Encouraged but not required. If Institution publishes open-access, Foundation will reimburse publication fees (up to $3,000).

---

**6. HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTION**

**IRB Approval**: Institution's IRB must approve study before any patient contact (Foundation requires IRB approval letter within 90 days of contract execution).

**Patient Consent**: All participants sign informed consent (mention Foundation funding, data sharing with Foundation).

**HIPAA Compliance**: De-identified data only (no patient names, addresses, SSNs, MRNs—use study IDs).

**Foundation IRB**: If Foundation's IRB exists, Institution will submit protocol for reciprocal review (dual approval—protects Foundation if patients enrolled through Foundation registry).

---

**7. TERM & TERMINATION**

**Term**: 3 years from contract execution (May 1, 2026 - April 30, 2029).

**Extension**: Possible with mutual written consent (if delays due to slow recruitment, COVID—Foundation sympathetic).

**Termination for Cause**:
- **By Foundation**: If Institution materially breaches (e.g., misuses funds, doesn't submit required reports, loses IRB approval)—30 days written notice, Institution must return unused funds
- **By Institution**: If Foundation doesn't pay on schedule—30 days written notice to cure, if unpaid, Institution can suspend work

**Termination for Convenience**:
- Either party may terminate with 90 days written notice (rare, but if Foundation loses funding or Institution PI leaves)

---

**8. GOVERNING LAW**

**Jurisdiction**: Laws of [State where Foundation incorporated—e.g., Delaware].

**Dispute Resolution**: Good-faith negotiation first → mediation (60 days) → arbitration (binding, JAMS rules) → litigation (last resort).

---

**9. SIGNATURES**

**Foundation**:

## Data Sharing Agreements

### Why Data Sharing Matters

**Problem**: AATD is rare (1 in 2,500 people)—single researcher's clinic has 50-100 patients (statistically underpowered for robust findings).

**Solution**: Pool data across institutions (Foundation facilitates—aggregates de-identified data from multiple academic partners → shared database → all partners analyze, discover patterns single-site studies miss).

**Example**: Foundation partners with 5 universities—each contributes 100 patients → 500-patient dataset → can detect genetic variants affecting 2-5% of patients (impossible with 100).

---

### Data Sharing Agreement (DSA) Template

**Between**: Mark Egly Foundation ("Data Provider") and [University] ("Data Recipient")

---

**1. PURPOSE**

Foundation operates AATD Patient Registry (500+ patients, demographics, genotypes, clinical outcomes, quality-of-life data). Data Recipient proposes research project: [Title].

Foundation agrees to share de-identified dataset (Appendix A—list of variables) for this specific research purpose only.

---

**2. DATA SCOPE**

**Variables Provided**:
- Demographics: Age, sex, race/ethnicity, state (not city—ZIP codes removed for privacy)
- Genotypes: PI*ZZ, PI*SZ, PI*MZ, PI*SS (not full genomic data—too identifiable)
- Clinical: FEV1 (% predicted), AATD augmentation therapy (yes/no), liver disease (yes/no)
- Quality of Life: SF-36 scores, SGRQ scores

**Sample Size**: N = 350 (patients who consented to data sharing)

**Format**: CSV file, data dictionary included (variable names, definitions, coding—e.g., sex: 1=male, 2=female)

---

**3. PERMITTED USES**

**Allowed**:
- ✅ Analyze data for proposed research project (genotype-phenotype correlation study)
- ✅ Publish aggregate results (tables, figures—no individual-level data)
- ✅ Share with co-authors at Data Recipient's institution (if covered by same IRB)

**Prohibited**:
- ❌ Re-identify patients (no combining with other datasets, reverse engineering identities)
- ❌ Share data with third parties (not even collaborators at other institutions—they need separate DSA)
- ❌ Use for unrelated research (different research question = new DSA required)
- ❌ Commercial use (sell to pharma company, use for proprietary algorithm—violation)

---

**4. DATA SECURITY**

**Storage**: Data must be stored on encrypted, password-protected device (not USB drive left in car).

**Access**: Only named researchers on IRB protocol can access (research coordinator, biostatistician—not entire lab).

**Transmission**: If emailing, use secure file transfer (Box, OneDrive—not regular email attachment).

**Retention**: Data Recipient will destroy data within 5 years of project completion (or return to Foundation—delete all copies).

---

**5. IRB APPROVAL**

Data Recipient's IRB approved project (IRB #___________). If IRB approval lapses, Data Recipient must stop using data immediately, notify Foundation.

---

**6. PUBLICATION**

**Acknowledgment**: "Data provided by Mark Egly Foundation AATD Patient Registry."

**Pre-Publication Review**: Share manuscript draft with Foundation 10 days before submission (Foundation checks patient privacy, no identifiable details inadvertently included).

**Authorship**: Foundation's CMO may be co-author if substantially involved (study design, interpretation—not automatic).

---

**7. TERM & TERMINATION**

**Term**: 5 years (renewable if ongoing research).

**Termination**: Foundation may terminate if Data Recipient breaches (e.g., shares data with unauthorized party)—Data Recipient must destroy data within 30 days, provide written certification of destruction.

---

**8. SIGNATURES**

[ED and University authorized signatory]

---

## Intellectual Property Ownership

### IP Considerations in AATD Research

**Key Principle**: Balance researcher incentives (patents = commercialization = new treatments available) with patient access (patents = monopolies = high drug prices).

---

### Foundation's IP Position

**Foundation Doesn't Claim IP** (Usually):
- ✅ Researchers did the work (discovered biomarker, invented diagnostic test)—they deserve credit, ownership
- ✅ Universities have tech transfer offices (expertise in patenting, licensing—Foundation lacks this)
- ✅ Patents incentivize commercialization (company won't invest $100M to develop drug unless exclusive rights)

**BUT Foundation Negotiates "Reach-Through Rights"**:
- 📄 **Non-exclusive license**: Foundation can use research findings for education (not sell, but share with patients)
- 📄 **Affordable access clause**: If University licenses to company, license agreement must include "reasonable pricing commitments" (not $500K/year orphan drug—Foundation can advocate for Medicaid coverage, patient assistance programs)
- 📄 **Global access**: If treatment patented, encourage licensing to generic manufacturers for low-income countries (AATD is worldwide—U.S. Foundation cares about global patients)

---

### Sample IP Clause (In SRA)

> **Intellectual Property**
>
> **Ownership**: Institution owns all inventions, discoveries, data, and other IP generated from research.
>
> **Foundation License**: Institution grants Foundation perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use research findings for:
> - Patient education and advocacy (publications, webinars, fact sheets)
> - Further academic research (sharing de-identified data with other researchers)
> - Foundation reports and grant applications
>
> **Commercialization Notifications**: Institution will notify Foundation within 30 days of:
> - Patent application filing
> - Licensing negotiations with commercial entities
>
> **Affordable Access Commitment**: If Institution licenses IP to commercial entity, Institution will negotiate in good faith to include terms ensuring AATD patients in U.S. and globally have affordable access to resulting products/services. Foundation may provide input on licensing terms (advisory role, not approval authority).
>
> **Acknowledgment**: Any patent applications resulting from research will acknowledge Foundation funding.

---

## Publication Rights & Authorship

### ICMJE Authorship Criteria

**Who Deserves Authorship?** (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors):

Must meet ALL 4:
1. **Substantial contributions** to conception/design OR data acquisition OR analysis/interpretation
2. **Drafting** article or critically revising for intellectual content
3. **Final approval** of version to be published
4. **Accountability** for all aspects (can defend findings if questioned)

**Don't Deserve Authorship** (Acknowledgment Instead):
- ❌ Funding only (Foundation pays for research ≠ automatic authorship)
- ❌ General supervision (PI supervises postdoc, doesn't write—PI still gets authorship for design contribution, but not just for supervision)
- ❌ Sample collection only (research coordinator draws blood, doesn't analyze—acknowledgment, not authorship)

---

### Foundation Staff Authorship

**Chief Medical Officer (CMO)**:
- **Often co-author** if CMO contributed to study design, data interpretation, manuscript writing (Foundation's scientific partner, not just funder)
- **Not automatic**—must meet ICMJE criteria

**Executive Director**:
- **Rarely co-author** (unless ED has scientific background and contributed substantively)
- **Acknowledgment** typical ("Funded by Mark Egly Foundation. We thank [ED name] for project support.")

**Authorship Discussion** (Upfront):
- Before project starts, PI and Foundation CMO discuss: "Will CMO be hands-on (weekly meetings, interpret data, co-write manuscript) or advisory (quarterly updates)?"
- Hands-on = authorship expected, Advisory = acknowledgment

---

### Foundation Review of Manuscripts

**Pre-Publication Review** (Standard in Academic Partnerships):
- **Timeline**: Foundation receives manuscript draft 10 business days before journal submission
- **Purpose**: (1) Check patient privacy (no identifiable details), (2) Verify Foundation described accurately, (3) Ensure results patient-friendly (suggest plain-language summary)

**Foundation Will NOT**:
- ❌ Censor unfavorable results ("This treatment didn't work"—okay, Foundation publishes truth)
- ❌ Rewrite conclusions (scientific independence respected)
- ❌ Delay indefinitely (10 days, can request 30-day extension if patent filing needed—rare)

**Foundation MAY Request**:
- ✅ Corrections to factual errors ("Foundation was established in 2024, not 2020")
- ✅ Addition of patient perspective box ("What these findings mean for AATD patients: [plain-language summary]")
- ✅ Acknowledgment wording ("This research was funded by Mark Egly Foundation through a sponsored research agreement.")

---

## IRB Coordination

### Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)

**What is IRB?**: Committee that reviews research involving human subjects—ensures ethical, safe, respects patient rights.

**Why IRBs Matter**: All universities have IRBs (federally required). Foundation-funded research on AATD patients = human subjects research = IRB approval required.

---

### Single IRB vs. Dual IRB

**Single IRB** (Most Common):
- University's IRB reviews, approves protocol
- Foundation relies on university's IRB (doesn't duplicate review—efficient, avoids conflicting requirements)
- **Foundation requires**: Copy of IRB approval letter, annual renewal notices

**Dual IRB** (If Foundation Has IRB):
- University IRB + Foundation IRB both review
- **When needed**: If Foundation directly recruits patients (Foundation becomes "engaged in research" per FDA rules)
- **Coordination**: Foundation IRB uses "reliance agreement" (defer to university IRB on scientific review, Foundation IRB just checks patient consent, privacy)

---

### IRB Protocol Checklist (Foundation Review)

Before approving partnership, Foundation's CMO reviews protocol for:

**Patient Safety**:
- ✅ **Risks minimized**: No unnecessary invasive procedures (extra blood draws patients don't benefit from)
- ✅ **Benefits realistic**: Consent form doesn't overpromise ("may help future patients" okay, "will cure your AATD" not okay)
- ✅ **Compensation fair**: $25-$50 per visit (not coercive, but respects patient time)

**Patient Privacy**:
- ✅ **HIPAA authorization**: Patients sign HIPAA form (allow researcher to access medical records)
- ✅ **Data de-identification**: Names, addresses removed before sharing with Foundation
- ✅ **Certificates of Confidentiality**: Protects patient data from subpoenas (NIH-funded research gets automatically, Foundation-funded should request)

**Informed Consent**:
- ✅ **Foundation mentioned**: Consent form states "This research funded by Mark Egly Foundation"
- ✅ **Data sharing disclosed**: "De-identified data may be shared with Mark Egly Foundation for future research"
- ✅ **Contact info**: Patient can contact Foundation with questions (Foundation patient navigator phone/email listed)

---

## Material Transfer Agreements

### What is MTA?

**Definition**: Contract governing transfer of biological materials (blood, DNA, tissue, cell lines) from one institution to another for research.

**Example**: Foundation's Biobank (stores 500 AATD patient blood samples) → Researcher at UCLA requests 50 samples for proteomics study → Foundation ships samples under MTA.

---

### MTA Key Terms

**1. Material Description**:
- Plasma samples (50 samples, 5 mL each, stored at -80°C)
- Patient genotypes: PI*ZZ (n=40), PI*SZ (n=10)

**2. Permitted Use**:
- Proteomics analysis (identify biomarkers for AATD exacerbations)
- Not for any other purpose (if researcher wants genetic sequencing, separate MTA needed)

**3. No Commercialization** (Often Included):
- Recipient will not sell samples, use for proprietary product development (without Foundation permission)
- If discovery leads to commercial opportunity, renegotiate terms

**4. No Transfer to Third Parties**:
- UCLA can't share samples with Pfizer collaborator—Pfizer needs separate MTA with Foundation

**5. Publication**:
- Acknowledge: "Samples provided by Mark Egly Foundation AATD Biobank"

**6. Destruction**:
- After project complete (or 5 years), UCLA destroys remaining samples (or returns to Foundation—Foundation pays shipping)

**7. Cost Recovery**:
- Foundation charges $100 per sample (covers processing, storage, shipping—not profit)

---

### Uniform Biological Material Transfer Agreement (UBMTA)

**Standard Form** (National Institutes of Health):
- Most universities use UBMTA (pre-negotiated, fills in blanks—faster than custom MTAs)
- Foundation joins UBMTA Master Agreement → future MTAs with other UBMTA institutions = 1-page Implementing Letter (not 10-page negotiation)

**Foundation Decision**: Join UBMTA by Year 5 (when biobank operational, frequent sample transfers expected).

---

## Conflict Resolution Mechanisms

### Why Conflicts Arise

**Common Disputes**:
- 🔴 **Publication delays**: Researcher missed deadline (Foundation frustrated, but science takes time)
- 🔴 **Authorship**: Foundation CMO expected co-authorship, researcher disagrees
- 🔴 **Data sharing**: Researcher reluctant to share raw data (worried Foundation will find errors, or use for competing publication)
- 🔴 **IP**: University tech transfer office wants exclusive pharma license (Foundation wants generic access)
- 🔴 **Budget**: Researcher spent funds on unapproved items (Foundation audits, finds $20K spent on equipment not in budget)

---

### Conflict Resolution Ladder (Escalation Protocol)

**Step 1: Direct Negotiation** (30 Days):
- PI and Foundation CMO talk it out (phone call, video meeting—most conflicts resolved here)
- Approach: "We're on same team—let's find solution that serves AATD patients and respects your research."

**Step 2: Mediation** (60 Days):
- Neutral third-party mediator (hire professional—$3K-$5K)
- Non-binding (mediator facilitates discussion, proposes compromises—parties agree or disagree)
- Success rate: 70-80% (cheaper, faster than arbitration)

**Step 3: Arbitration** (90 Days):
- Binding decision by arbitrator (often retired judge, or JAMS arbitrator)
- Each party presents case, arbitrator rules (winner/loser outcome—less collaborative than mediation)
- Cost: $10K-$30K (split between Foundation and Institution)

**Step 4: Litigation** (Last Resort):
- Court lawsuit (expensive—$50K-$200K legal fees, takes 2-3 years)
- Destroys relationship (rarely used in academic partnerships—bad PR for both parties)

**Contract Provision**:
> **Dispute Resolution**
>
> In the event of any dispute arising from this Agreement, parties agree to:
> 1. Good-faith negotiation (30 days)
> 2. Mediation (60 days, mediator mutually agreed upon)
> 3. Binding arbitration (JAMS rules, [State] jurisdiction)
> 4. Litigation only if arbitration fails

---

## Legal Review Costs

### Why Legal Review Needed

**Complexity**: Academic contracts = 20-50 pages, legal jargon (indemnification, IP assignments, governing law)—Foundation staff not lawyers, need expert review.

**Risk**: Signing bad contract = Foundation owes university $100K with no deliverables, or university patents discovery, locks Foundation out of patient education use.

---

### Legal Review Budget

**Attorney Types**:

**1. General Nonprofit Counsel** ($200-$400/hour):
- Reviews routine contracts (data sharing agreements, MTAs, small grants <$25K)
- 2-4 hours/contract = $400-$1,600 per contract

**2. Research Contracts Specialist** ($300-$500/hour):
- Reviews complex sponsored research agreements (IP, indemnification, multi-year budgets)
- 6-10 hours/contract = $1,800-$5,000 per contract

**3. University In-House Counsel** (Sometimes Negotiates Directly):
- University's grants office attorney negotiates with Foundation's attorney (faster, both know academic norms)

### Legal Cost Estimates

| **Partnership Type**            | **Legal Review Time** | **Attorney Rate** | **Cost per Contract** | **Annual Volume** | **Annual Total** |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| **Data Sharing Agreements**     | 2-3 hours             | $300/hour         | $600-$900             | 3-5               | $2K-$5K          |

### Cost Savings Strategies

**1. Template Contracts**:
- Foundation develops standard templates (DSA, MTA, SRA)—attorney reviews once ($3K-$5K), then reuse (only negotiate deviations, not entire contract)

**2. Join UBMTA**:
- Material transfers use pre-approved UBMTA form ($0 legal review after joining)

**3. Retainer Agreement**:
- Hire attorney on retainer ($2K/month for 5-10 hours)—predictable cost, faster response (attorney familiar with Foundation, doesn't re-learn context each time)

**4. In-House Expertise**:
- Year 10+ (if budget allows), hire General Counsel (0.5 FTE, $60K-$75K)—reviews most contracts in-house, only outsources highly specialized (e.g., patent licensing)

## Partnership Performance Monitoring

### Why Monitor Performance?

**Accountability**: Foundation invests $50K-$200K per partnership—need to ensure researcher delivering (not ghost, spending funds appropriately, progressing toward goals).

**Early Intervention**: If project behind schedule (slow patient recruitment, lab equipment breakdown), Foundation can help (extend timeline, connect researcher to AATD patient groups, provide extra funding if justified).

---

### Monitoring Tools

**1. Quarterly Progress Reports**:
- **Required**: All sponsored research agreements, submitted 30 days after quarter end
- **Content** (1-2 pages):
  - Milestones achieved (enrolled 25 patients, completed baseline assessments)
  - Challenges (recruitment slower than expected—clinic COVID restrictions)
  - Upcoming activities (next quarter: 12-month follow-up visits, interim data analysis)
  - Budget status (spent $35K of $50K Year 1 budget—on track)

**2. Annual Detailed Reports**:
- **Required**: All partnerships, submitted within 60 days of anniversary
- **Content** (10-15 pages):
  - Background & objectives (remind Foundation what study is)
  - Methods (detailed protocol, any changes from original—need IRB amendment)
  - Results (tables, figures—preliminary data if analysis ongoing)
  - Publications/presentations (list manuscripts submitted, conference abstracts)
  - Budget accounting (line-item actuals vs. budget, explain variances >10%)

**3. Site Visits** (Optional):
- Foundation ED/CMO visit researcher's lab (see firsthand—meet team, review data, discuss challenges)
- Frequency: 1-2 times during 3-year project (kickoff visit Year 1, mid-point check Year 2)
- Cost: $1,500-$3,000 (travel, accommodations)

**4. Financial Audits** (If Large Grants >$100K):
- Foundation hires external auditor to review researcher's books (ensure funds spent per budget)
- Frequency: Rare (only if red flags—vague financial reports, significant variances)
- Cost: $5K-$15K

### Performance Metrics

**Quantitative**:
- ✅ **Patient enrollment**: On track to meet N (target 100, enrolled 85 by Month 18—good)
- ✅ **Publication**: Manuscript submitted within 12 months of data collection completion (yes/no)
- ✅ **Budget adherence**: Actual spending within 10% of budget (if 20% over, explain why)

**Qualitative**:
- ✅ **Communication responsiveness**: PI replies to Foundation emails within 1 week (respectful of Foundation's time)
- ✅ **Collaboration openness**: PI welcomes Foundation input (doesn't treat Foundation as ATM, values partnership)
- ✅ **Patient-centeredness**: PI considers patient perspectives (endpoint measures patients care about, not just scientifically interesting)

## Partnership Termination

### When to End Partnership Early

**Termination for Cause** (Researcher Breach):
- 🔴 **Misuse of funds**: Spent grant on unrelated research, personal expenses (violation of contract, possibly fraud)
- 🔴 **Lost IRB approval**: IRB suspended study due to protocol violations (can't continue research)
- 🔴 **Failure to deliver**: 2 years into 3-year project, zero progress (no enrollment, no reports—Foundation wasted money)
- 🔴 **Scientific misconduct**: Data fabrication, plagiarism (ethical violation, destroys credibility)

**Termination for Convenience** (No Fault):
- ⚠️ **PI leaves institution**: PI takes job elsewhere, new institution won't assume grant (rare, but happens)
- ⚠️ **Foundation financial crisis**: Foundation loses major donor, can't afford to continue funding (unfortunate, but honest)
- ⚠️ **External factors**: COVID-19 shuts down lab for 18 months, project infeasible (force majeure)

---

### Termination Process

**Step 1: Notice** (30-90 Days Written Notice):
- Foundation emails university grants office + PI: "Mark Egly Foundation is terminating [Project Title] effective [date] due to [reason]."

**Step 2: Work Stoppage**:
- PI stops all research activities (no new patient enrollment, no new data collection)
- Existing patient visits may continue if ethically required (can't abandon patients mid-study—Foundation may fund completion of enrolled patients, but not new enrollment)

**Step 3: Financial Reconciliation**:
- PI submits final financial report (spent $80K of $150K—Foundation paid $75K upfront, researcher owes $5K refund OR Foundation pays $5K to close out spent funds)
- Unused funds returned to Foundation within 60 days

**Step 4: Deliverables**:
- Even if terminated, PI must submit final report (summary of work completed, data collected, preliminary findings)
- Data remains Foundation's per agreement (de-identified dataset provided)

**Step 5: IP Disposition**:
- Any IP generated before termination = researcher keeps (per original contract terms)
- No future IP claims (work stopped, no new discoveries)

---

### Post-Termination Relationships

**Can Foundation Partner Again After Termination?**

**Depends on Reason**:
- ✅ **Termination for Convenience** (COVID, PI left): Yes, no hard feelings—if researcher lands elsewhere, Foundation may fund new project
- ⚠️ **Termination for Cause** (poor performance, budget issues): Maybe—if correctable (PI hired better coordinator, tightened budget controls), Foundation may give second chance
- ❌ **Termination for Misconduct** (fraud, data fabrication): Never—Foundation blacklists researcher (reputation risk)
