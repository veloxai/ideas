## Performance Management Philosophy

### Foundation's Approach to Performance

**Mission-Driven Performance**: Individual success = mission success. Performance reviews evaluate not just what employees accomplish (outputs) but how it advances Alpha-1 awareness, patient support, and research (outcomes).

**Growth, Not Punishment**: Reviews identify strengths to amplify and gaps to develop—not just "gotcha" documentation for termination. 80% of review = forward-looking (goals for next year, development plan), 20% = backward-looking (last year's accomplishments).

**Ongoing, Not Once-a-Year**: Annual review = formal documentation, but feedback continuous (quarterly check-ins, weekly 1-on-1s, real-time praise/coaching). No surprises at annual review—employee should already know where they stand.

**Fairness & Consistency**: Same standards across roles (no favoritism—rockstar gets honest feedback on improvement areas, struggling employee gets recognition for wins). Calibration process ensures managers rate consistently (not easy graders vs. tough graders).

---

### Benefits of Robust Performance Management

**For Employees**:

- ✅ **Clarity**: Know what's expected (goals, competencies, success criteria—not guessing what manager wants)
- ✅ **Recognition**: Wins celebrated (patient testimonial, grant funded, system implemented—formal acknowledgment)
- ✅ **Development**: Skills built (training, stretch projects, mentorship—grow career, not stagnate)
- ✅ **Fairness**: Promotion/raise decisions transparent (performance ratings + criteria visible—not black box)

**For Foundation**:

- ✅ **Alignment**: Everyone rowing same direction (strategic plan → department goals → individual goals—cascading objectives)
- ✅ **Accountability**: Performance documented (if underperformer, paper trail supports PIP or termination—legally defensible)
- ✅ **Retention**: Top performers stay (high ratings + raises + career path = engagement; neglecting = lose best to competitors)
- ✅ **Succession**: Identify future leaders (high-potentials fast-tracked—Development Coordinator → Director → VP track)

---

### Core Principles

**1. Two-Way Conversation** (Not Manager Lecture):

- Employee self-assessment (reflect on wins, challenges, growth areas—share before meeting)
- Manager feedback (observations, data, examples—specific, not vague)
- Collaborative goal-setting (next year's priorities—employee ownership increases buy-in)

**2. Evidence-Based** (Not Opinion):

- Use data (grants submitted, patients enrolled, fundraising $, project completion rates—quantitative where possible)
- Use examples (specific instances—"You led Alpha-1 Awareness Month campaign, raised $50K, exceeded $35K goal by 43%"—not "You're great at fundraising")
- Avoid recency bias (review full year—not just last 2 months fresh in memory)

**3. Developmental** (Not Just Evaluative):

- Identify 2-3 growth areas (skills to build—public speaking, data analysis, grant writing)
- Create plan (training, mentorship, stretch project—actionable steps, not "get better at X")
- Follow up quarterly (progress on development plan—adjust if needed)

## Performance Review Cycle

### Annual Cycle Overview

**Timeline** (Fiscal Year = Calendar Year):

| **Month**            | **Activity**              | **Participants**                                   | **Deliverable**                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **January**          | Q4 Check-In               | Employee + Manager                                 | Q4 progress update, adjust Q1 goals          |
| **February**         | Annual Review Prep        | Employee (self-assessment), Manager (draft review) | Self-assessment, manager notes               |
| **March**            | Annual Review Meetings    | Employee + Manager                                 | Completed review form, signed acknowledgment |
| **March**            | Calibration               | All Managers + COO                                 | Ratings finalized, consistency ensured       |
| **April**            | Compensation Decisions    | COO + ED                                           | Merit increases, bonuses approved            |
| **May**              | Compensation Communicated | Manager → Employee                                 | Salary letter, bonus check                   |
| **May**              | Goal Setting for New Year | Employee + Manager                                 | SMART goals for upcoming year                |
| **April-July**       | Q1 Check-In               | Employee + Manager                                 | Goal progress, coaching                      |
| **August-October**   | Q2 Check-In               | Employee + Manager                                 | Mid-year course correction                   |
| **November-January** | Q3 Check-In               | Employee + Manager                                 | Year-end sprint priorities                   |

---

### Quarterly Check-Ins (Informal, 30-60 minutes)

**Purpose**: Real-time feedback, course correction, prevent surprises at annual review

**Format**:

1. **Employee Prep** (10 min before meeting):
   - Review goals (progress on 5 annual SMART goals—where am I?)
   - Wins to share (accomplishments since last check-in—celebrate)
   - Obstacles (blockers, help needed—problem-solve)

2. **Meeting Agenda** (30 min):
   - **Progress Review** (10 min): Each goal—on track (green), at risk (yellow), behind (red)—discuss
   - **Feedback Exchange** (10 min): Manager shares observations (what's going well, areas for improvement); employee asks clarifying questions
   - **Problem-Solving** (5 min): Stuck on goal? Adjust timeline, get resources, remove blocker
   - **Next Quarter Priorities** (5 min): Top 3 focus areas—clarity for next 90 days

3. **Documentation**:
   - Manager logs notes in HR system (Asana or Google Doc—date, discussion summary, action items)
   - No formal rating (check-ins = coaching, not evaluation—safe space for candor)

**Frequency**: Quarterly minimum (every 3 months)—high-performers may need less (self-directed), struggling employees may need biweekly

---

### Annual Performance Review (Formal, 90-120 minutes)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive evaluation, rating, compensation decisions, goal-setting for next year

**Timeline**: February self-assessment → March review meetings → April calibration & compensation → May salary adjustments

**Format** (detailed below in Section 6)

---

## Goal Setting & SMART Goals

### Goal-Setting Process

**When**: May (after annual review complete, before Q1 starts)

**How Many**: 5 SMART goals per employee (fewer = lack of ambition, more = diluted focus)

**Who Sets**: Collaborative (manager proposes draft based on strategic plan, employee refines based on interests/capacity, agree together)

---

### SMART Criteria

**S = Specific**: Clear, unambiguous (not "improve fundraising"—"increase individual donor revenue by 20% from $100K to $120K")

**M = Measurable**: Quantifiable (number, $, %, date—know when achieved)

**A = Achievable**: Challenging but realistic (stretch goal = 110% effort required, not impossible 300%)

**R = Relevant**: Ties to strategic plan or job description (not random—Development Officer shouldn't have goal "Improve IT security"—that's IT Manager's goal)

**T = Time-Bound**: Deadline (by December 31, by Q3, by end of fiscal year—not open-ended)

---

### Goal Examples by Role

**Executive Director**:

1. **Fundraising**: Secure $800K in revenue (50% grants, 30% individual donors, 20% events)—15% increase from prior year
2. **Board Development**: Recruit 3 new Board members (racial/ethnic diversity, <40 years old, bring fundraising/medical expertise)
3. **Strategic Plan**: Complete 5-year strategic plan refresh (Board approval by June 30)
4. **Partnerships**: Launch collaboration with 2 new medical centers (Alpha-1 screening programs—Midwest and South regions)
5. **Visibility**: Publish 4 op-eds in major outlets (NPR, Washington Post, STAT News—raise Alpha-1 awareness)

**Development Director**:

1. **Individual Donors**: Increase donor base from 300 to 400 active donors (+33%), average gift $250 → $300
2. **Major Gifts**: Secure 2 gifts ≥$25K (cultivation, proposals, stewardship)
3. **Grant Writing**: Submit 12 grant proposals ($1.2M requested), 40% success rate ($480K awarded)
4. **Stewardship**: Implement donor CRM (Salesforce—migrate from spreadsheets, launch by Q2)
5. **Events**: Plan annual gala (200 attendees, net $150K after expenses)

**Patient Navigator**:

1. **Patient Enrollment**: Enroll 50 newly diagnosed patients in registry (REDCap—up from 35 prior year)
2. **Responsiveness**: Respond to patient inquiries within 24 hours (100% compliance—track in ticketing system)
3. **Satisfaction**: Achieve 4.5/5 average satisfaction score (quarterly surveys—Net Promoter Score methodology)
4. **Support Groups**: Facilitate 12 virtual support group sessions (monthly—attendance avg 15 patients/session)
5. **Resources**: Develop patient education library (10 new resources—infographics, FAQs, videos on alpha1.org)

**Research Coordinator**:

1. **Data Quality**: Achieve 98% registry data completeness (all required fields populated—audit quarterly)
2. **Publications**: Co-author 2 peer-reviewed publications (manuscript submissions by Q4)
3. **Partnerships**: Establish data-sharing agreements with 3 academic institutions (expand research collaborations)
4. **IRB Compliance**: Zero IRB violations (maintain approved protocols, submit modifications on time)
5. **Dissemination**: Present at 2 conferences (Alpha-1 Foundation Annual Meeting, American Thoracic Society—poster or oral)

---

### Cascading Goals (Alignment)

**Strategic Plan → Department Goals → Individual Goals**

**Example**:

- **Strategic Plan** (Year 2): "Increase patient registry from 500 to 1,000 enrollees"
- **Department Goal** (Patient Services): "Enroll 250 new patients (50% of 500 growth)"
- **Individual Goal** (Patient Navigator): "Enroll 50 new patients (20% of department's 250)"

Ensures everyone contributes to organizational priorities (not siloed—Development can't ignore patient enrollment because "not my job"—development goal might be "Secure $50K grant for patient outreach")

---

## Evaluation Criteria & Competencies

### Performance Rating Scale

**5-Point Scale** (Aligned to Merit Increases):

| **Rating** | **Label**         | **Description**                                                                               | **% of Staff** (Target Distribution)         | **Merit Increase** |
| ---------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **5**      | Exceptional       | Far exceeds expectations—transformational impact, goes beyond role, mentors others, innovates | 5-10% (rare—reserved for truly outstanding)  | 5-7%               |
| **4**      | Exceeds           | Consistently surpasses goals—delivers high-quality work, takes initiative, reliable           | 20-25% (strong performers)                   | 3-5%               |
| **3**      | Meets             | Fully meets expectations—solid contributor, achieves goals, competent in role                 | 50-60% (majority—"meets" = successful)       | 2-3%               |
| **2**      | Needs Improvement | Below expectations—goals partially met, quality concerns, requires close supervision          | 10-15% (coaching, PIP consideration)         | 0-1%               |
| **1**      | Unsatisfactory    | Fails to meet expectations—goals not achieved, performance deficits, PIP or termination       | <5% (rare—usually exit before annual review) | 0% (no raise)      |

**Forced Distribution** (Soft, Not Rigid):

- COO monitors distribution (if 80% rated "Exceeds," managers inflating—recalibrate)
- Context matters (startup year = all high-performers; mature org = normal distribution expected)

---

---

## 360-Degree Feedback Process

### Purpose

**Traditional Review** = Manager evaluates employee (one perspective—what if manager biased, doesn't see day-to-day work?)

**360-Degree** = Multiple perspectives:

- Manager (supervisor view—strategic alignment, goal achievement)
- Peers (colleagues—collaboration, communication, reliability)
- Direct Reports (if manager—leadership, support, clarity)
- Self (employee reflection—self-awareness, growth areas)

**Result**: Holistic view (blind spots revealed—employee thinks they're great communicator, but peers say emails confusing; manager thinks employee needs improvement, but peers say they're rockstar)

---

### Who Participates

**All Employees**: Annual 360-degree feedback (not just managers—everyone benefits from multi-source input)

**Raters** (Employee selects + manager adds):

- **Self**: Employee (required—self-assessment)
- **Manager**: Direct supervisor (required—primary rater)
- **Peers**: 2-4 colleagues (work closely with—cross-functional preferred, not just same department)
- **Direct Reports**: If manage staff, 2-4 direct reports (anonymous—safety to be candid)
- **External Stakeholders** (Optional): Board members, donors, partners, patients (if role involves—Development Director gets donor feedback, Patient Navigator gets patient feedback)

**Selection Criteria**:

- Work together regularly (≥3 months—new colleague doesn't have enough observation)
- Diverse perspectives (not all friends—include someone who's seen you struggle)
- Confidentiality (feedback anonymous—except manager and self)

---

### 360-Degree Feedback Survey

**Platform**: Culture Amp ($5/employee—360-degree feedback tool), SurveyMonkey (free tier adequate Year 1-2), or Google Forms (manual but zero cost)

**Survey Structure** (20 questions, 10 minutes):

**Section 1: Core Competencies** (Rate 1-5 scale):

1. Demonstrates mission alignment (passionate about Alpha-1 cause, decisions prioritize patients)
2. Collaborates effectively (works well with others, shares knowledge, resolves conflicts constructively)
3. Communicates clearly (emails, meetings, presentations—concise, understandable, timely)
4. Accountable and reliable (meets deadlines, owns mistakes, follows through on commitments)
5. Adapts to change (embraces new processes, learns quickly, flexible when priorities shift)
6. Shows sound judgment (makes good decisions, escalates appropriately, acts ethically)
7. Takes initiative (proactive, improves processes, innovates)
8. Delivers quality work (attention to detail, meets standards, error-free)

**Section 2: Role-Specific** (Tailored by job):

- Development: Builds strong donor relationships
- Patient Navigator: Shows empathy and patience with patients
- Research: Ensures data accuracy and IRB compliance

**Section 3: Open-Ended** (Free text):

1. What does this person do exceptionally well? (strengths to continue)
2. What is one area for improvement? (specific, actionable—not "be better," say "respond to emails within 24 hours")
3. Any additional comments?

**Anonymity**: Peer and direct report feedback anonymous (aggregated—can't identify individual rater)—encourages honesty

---

### Feedback Report

**COO Compiles** (February—before annual review meetings):

- Aggregate ratings (average scores—self, manager, peers, direct reports)
- Thematic analysis of open-ended (common themes—"great communicator" mentioned by 3 peers, "sometimes misses deadlines" mentioned by 2)
- Strengths vs. Development Areas (top 3 each)

**Example Report** (Development Director):

**Strengths**:

1. **Donor Relationships** (4.8/5 average): "Goes above and beyond—handwritten thank-you notes, remembers donors' birthdays, makes them feel valued" (Peer feedback)
2. **Grant Writing** (4.6/5): "Proposals compelling, data-driven, clear—high success rate" (Manager feedback)
3. **Collaboration** (4.5/5): "Works seamlessly with Patient Services to secure testimonials, with Research for data—true team player" (Peer feedback)

**Development Areas**:

1. **Timeliness** (3.2/5): "Sometimes late on deliverables—CRM updates lag, donor reports delayed" (Manager + Peer feedback)
2. **Delegation** (3.0/5): "Tries to do everything solo—could empower Development Coordinator more" (Direct Report feedback)
3. **Strategic Thinking** (3.5/5): "Executes tactics well, but could elevate to strategic vision—what's 3-year fundraising trajectory?" (Manager feedback)

---

## Annual Performance Review

### Preparation (February)

**Employee Self-Assessment** (Due February 15):

- Review job description (still accurate? role evolved?)
- Assess goals (5 SMART goals—achieved, partially achieved, not achieved—provide evidence)
- Rate self on competencies (1-5 scale—honest self-reflection, not inflated)
- Accomplishments (5-10 wins—projects completed, challenges overcome, impact delivered)
- Challenges (obstacles faced—lack of resources, skill gaps, unclear priorities)
- Development interests (skills to build, roles to explore—career aspirations)

**Template**: Google Form (standardized—COO compiles responses, shares with managers)

---

**Manager Review** (Due February 28):

- Review employee self-assessment (alignment or disconnect?—if employee rates self 5 but manager sees 3, dig into why)
- Review 360-degree feedback (identify themes—strengths, development areas, blind spots)
- Assess goals (manager's evaluation—did employee achieve? context matters—goal missed due to employee or external factors?)
- Rate competencies (manager's ratings—1-5 scale, use rubric for consistency)
- Write narrative (2-3 paragraphs—overall performance, key accomplishments, areas for growth)
- Draft development plan (2-3 growth areas, specific actions—training, mentorship, stretch project)

**Template**: Performance Review Form (Google Doc—standardized, COO provides to managers)

---

### Annual Review Meeting (March)

**Scheduling**: Manager schedules 90-120 minutes (in-person or Zoom if remote—video on, distraction-free)

**Meeting Agenda**:

**1. Opening** (5 min):

- Manager: "Thank you for your self-assessment and 360 participation. Today's goals: (1) review your performance, (2) discuss development, (3) set goals for next year. This is a conversation—please share your thoughts."
- Set tone (collaborative, not adversarial—goal = help employee succeed)

**2. Employee Self-Reflection** (10 min):

- Manager: "Walk me through your self-assessment. What are you most proud of? Where do you see growth opportunities?"
- Listen actively (don't interrupt—understand employee's perspective before sharing yours)

**3. Manager Feedback** (30 min):

- **Accomplishments** (15 min): "Here's what I observed—strengths, wins, impact. You led Alpha-1 Awareness Month campaign, exceeded fundraising goal by 43%, that's exceptional." (Specific examples, not vague praise)
- **Development Areas** (15 min): "Here's where I see opportunity. Timeliness—CRM updates sometimes lag, donor reports delayed. 360 feedback echoed this. Let's discuss—what's causing delays? How can I support?" (Frame as growth, not criticism—problem-solve together)

**4. 360-Degree Feedback** (15 min):

- Share aggregated report (strengths, development areas—no individual attribution, themes only)
- Discuss surprises (blind spots—"You rated yourself 5 on communication, but peers averaged 3.5—let's explore")
- Identify patterns (if self, manager, peers all say same thing—definitely true)

**5. Performance Rating** (10 min):

- Manager: "Based on goals, competencies, 360 feedback, I'm rating your performance as [Exceeds/Meets/Needs Improvement]. Here's my rationale..." (Explain, provide examples)
- Employee: "How do you feel about this rating?" (Check alignment—if employee disagrees, discuss; if agree, move forward)

**6. Development Plan** (15 min):

- Identify 2-3 growth areas (from review—timeliness, delegation, strategic thinking)
- Create action plan (specific steps—timeliness: block calendar for CRM updates Fridays 2-3pm, set reminders; delegation: assign donor research to coordinator by Q2; strategic thinking: attend AFP fundraising conference, read "Strategic Fundraising" book by Q3)
- Manager support (training budget, mentorship pairing, project assignment—commit resources)

**7. Goal Setting (Next Year)** (15 min):

- Manager shares draft goals (aligned to strategic plan—5 SMART goals)
- Employee feedback (too ambitious? too easy? missing something important?—refine together)
- Finalize (agreement on 5 goals—write in form, both sign)

**8. Compensation** (5 min):

- Manager: "Compensation decisions finalize in April after calibration. Based on your rating, you're eligible for [X%] merit increase + [bonus if applicable]. Official letter in May." (Set expectations—not final until calibration)

**9. Closing** (5 min):

- Manager: "Thank you for year of hard work. Excited to see your growth in timeliness and strategic thinking. Let's check in quarterly on development plan. Questions?"
- Employee acknowledgment (sign form—acknowledges review occurred, not necessarily agrees with rating)

---

### Documentation

**Performance Review Form** (Manager completes, employee signs):

- Employee info (name, title, department, review period)
- Goal achievement (5 SMART goals—rating 1-5 each, narrative explanation)
- Competency ratings (8 core + role-specific—1-5 each)
- 360-degree summary (strengths, development areas)
- Overall rating (1-5—Exceptional, Exceeds, Meets, Needs Improvement, Unsatisfactory)
- Manager narrative (2-3 paragraphs—accomplishments, challenges, overall assessment)
- Development plan (2-3 growth areas, action steps, timeline, resources)
- Goals for next year (5 SMART goals)
- Signatures (employee, manager, COO—employee signature = acknowledgment, not agreement; if disagree, can add comments)

**Storage**: Employee personnel file (Asana or Google Drive—confidential, HR and manager access only, retained 7 years post-employment per record retention policy)

---

### Calibration Session (Late March)

**Purpose**: Ensure rating consistency across managers (Manager A's "Exceeds" = Manager B's "Exceeds"—not grade inflation or deflation)

**Participants**: All managers + COO + ED (if <5 managers, include all; if >5, by department)

**Process**:

1. **Prepare**: Each manager brings ratings (employee name, proposed rating, justification)
2. **Review**: Go employee-by-employee (manager presents: "I rated Jane 'Exceeds' because she achieved 5/5 goals, led major initiative, 360 feedback strong")
3. **Challenge**: Other managers ask questions ("Why 'Exceeds' vs. 'Exceptional'? Compare to John who also achieved goals—are they same level?")
4. **Adjust**: If consensus = rating too high/low, adjust (rare—maybe 5-10% of ratings change)
5. **Finalize**: COO approves final ratings (checks distribution—not all 5s or all 3s)

**Outcome**: Consistent, fair ratings (employees perceive fairness—"My manager isn't easy/hard grader, just accurate")

---

## Performance Improvement Plans

### When PIP Required

**Trigger**: Rating "Needs Improvement" (2/5) or "Unsatisfactory" (1/5)

**Not Punishment**: PIP = structured support (clear expectations, coaching, timeline—give employee chance to succeed before termination)

**Duration**: 60-90 days (shorter = too little time to improve; longer = drags on if not improving)

---

### PIP Process

**Step 1: PIP Meeting** (Manager + Employee + COO):

- **Discuss Performance Gaps**: Specific deficiencies (not "bad attitude"—"Missed 4 of 10 deadlines in Q4, submitted reports with ≥5 errors requiring rework")
- **Set Expectations**: What "success" looks like (e.g., "Meet 100% of deadlines, submit error-free reports, respond to emails within 24 hours")
- **Create Action Plan**: Steps to improve (weekly check-ins with manager, time management training, peer shadowing)
- **Define Timeline**: 60 or 90 days (end date clear—June 1 start, July 30 end)
- **Explain Consequences**: If don't improve, termination (serious but fair warning)

**Step 2: Weekly Check-Ins** (Manager + Employee):

- Review progress (what's working? what's not?)
- Provide coaching (real-time feedback, not waiting until PIP end)
- Adjust plan if needed (if training doesn't help, try different approach)

**Step 3: Mid-PIP Review** (30 days in):

- Formal progress assessment (on track? at risk? not improving?)
- Written feedback (document improvement or continued deficiencies)
- Decision point (if zero improvement, may extend PIP or proceed to termination—but give fair chance)

**Step 4: Final PIP Review** (End of 60-90 days):

- **Outcome 1: Successful** (performance meets expectations—remove from PIP, continue employment, quarterly check-ins next 6 months to ensure sustained improvement)
- **Outcome 2: Partial** (some improvement but not enough—extend PIP another 30 days, or transition to role better fit, or terminate if inadequate progress)
- **Outcome 3: Unsuccessful** (no improvement or worsened—terminate employment, provide severance if eligible, exit procedures)

---

### PIP Documentation (Critical for Legal Defense)

**PIP Form** (Template):

- Employee info (name, title, department, manager)
- Performance deficiencies (specific examples—dates, incidents, impact)
- Expectations for improvement (measurable—"Meet 100% deadlines" not "improve performance")
- Support provided (training, coaching, resources)
- Timeline (start date, check-in dates, end date)
- Consequences (termination if not improve)
- Signatures (employee, manager, COO—employee signs acknowledging receipt, can add comments if disagrees)

**Weekly Check-In Notes**: Manager documents each meeting (progress, challenges, coaching provided—shows good-faith effort to support employee)

**Final Outcome**: Successful completion letter or termination letter (if termination, references PIP process—shows Foundation gave fair chance)

## Compensation Linkage

### Merit Increase Matrix

**Annual Raises** (April decisions, May implementation):

| **Performance Rating**    | **Merit Increase Range** | **Typical Increase**                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **5 - Exceptional**       | 5-7%                     | 6% ($50K salary → $53K)             |
| **4 - Exceeds**           | 3-5%                     | 4% ($50K → $52K)                    |
| **3 - Meets**             | 2-3%                     | 2.5% ($50K → $51.25K)               |
| **2 - Needs Improvement** | 0-1%                     | 0% (rare 1% if showing improvement) |
| **1 - Unsatisfactory**    | 0%                       | 0% (no raise)                       |

**Budget Constraint**: COO calculates total merit pool (e.g., 3% of payroll—$600K payroll × 3% = $18K merit budget)—distribute per ratings, may adjust ranges if budget tight

**Communication** (Manager → Employee, May):

- Salary increase letter (effective date, new salary, rationale—"Based on 'Exceeds' rating, 4% merit increase approved")
- Update payroll (HR processes—new salary effective first paycheck in May)

---

### Performance Bonus (Discretionary Year 2+)

**When**: If Foundation exceeds revenue goals significantly (e.g., budgeted $600K, raised $750K = $150K surplus—share 10% with team as bonuses = $15K bonus pool)

**Eligibility**: Employees rated "Meets" or higher (not "Needs Improvement"—bonus = reward for strong performance)

**Distribution**:

- **Equal Bonus** (Simpler): $15K ÷ 10 employees = $1,500 each (regardless of rating—team success)
- **Tiered Bonus** (More Equitable): Exceptional = 2x share, Exceeds = 1.5x, Meets = 1x (Exceptional gets $3K, Exceeds $2.25K, Meets $1.5K)

**Timing**: May (with merit increases—announce together for impact)

---

### Promotion & Compensation Adjustment

**Promotion** (Role change with increased responsibility):

- Trigger: Employee ready for next level (Development Coordinator → Development Manager—takes on grant writing, supervises intern)
- Compensation increase: 10-20% (reflect expanded scope—$50K → $55K-$60K)
- Effective date: Typically January or July (aligned with budget cycles)

**Off-Cycle Raise** (Rare):

- Trigger: Market adjustment (competitor offers employee $70K, Foundation pays $60K—counteroffer $65K to retain), or significant scope expansion mid-year (Research Coordinator takes on biobank management—immediate 15% raise)
- Requires ED approval (out-of-cycle = budget impact, set precedent)

---

## Career Development & Succession

### Individual Development Plans

**All Employees**: 2-3 development goals annually (from performance review)

**Categories**:

- **Skill-Building**: Hard skills (grant writing course, SQL training, public speaking workshop)
- **Leadership**: Soft skills (conflict resolution, delegation, strategic thinking—for future managers)
- **Cross-Functional**: Shadow other departments (Development shadows Patient Services to understand patient stories—better fundraising; Research shadows Development to understand funder priorities—better grant proposals)

**Resources**:

- **Training Budget**: $2,000/employee/year (conferences, courses, certifications—see Professional Development in Benefits Guide)
- **Mentorship**: Pair junior staff with senior (Development Coordinator with Development Director—monthly coffee chats, draft review, career advice)
- **Stretch Projects**: Assign beyond current role (Patient Navigator leads Alpha-1 Awareness Month campaign—builds project management, marketing skills)

---

### Career Pathing

**Purpose**: Show employees growth trajectory (not dead-end jobs—Patient Navigator can become Patient Services Manager can become COO)

**Foundation Career Ladder** (Example):

**Development Track**:

1. Development Coordinator (Year 0-2): Support (donor research, data entry, event logistics)
2. Development Officer (Year 2-4): Execution (grant writing, donor cultivation, campaign management)
3. Development Director (Year 4-7): Strategy (fundraising strategy, team supervision, Board liaison)
4. Chief Development Officer (Year 7+): Leadership (organizational fundraising responsibility, ED partner)

**Patient Services Track**:

1. Patient Navigator (Year 0-3): Direct service (patient support, resource referral, registry enrollment)
2. Patient Services Manager (Year 3-5): Supervision (lead navigators, program design, quality assurance)
3. Chief Patient Officer (Year 5+): Strategy (patient services strategy, clinical partnerships, advocacy leadership)

**Promotion Criteria**:

- **Performance**: 2+ years "Meets" or "Exceeds" in current role (proven track record)
- **Readiness**: Demonstrated competencies for next level (coordinator who writes grants = ready for officer; navigator who trains peers = ready for manager)
- **Vacancy**: Open position (not create manager role if no team to manage—wait for growth)

---

### Succession Planning (Critical Roles)

**High-Risk Roles** (If leave suddenly, Foundation struggles):

- **Executive Director**: Fundraising relationships, Board liaison, external visibility
- **Development Director**: Grant pipeline, donor relationships, institutional knowledge
- **Patient Navigator**: Patient trust, Alpha-1 expertise, community connections

**Mitigation**:

- **Cross-Training**: Two people know critical tasks (Development Director trains Coordinator on top donor relationships—Coordinator can step in if emergency)
- **Documentation**: Processes documented (not in one person's head—grant templates, donor CRM notes, patient resource guides)
- **Emergency Succession**: Board designates interim ED if ED leaves (COO or Board Chair steps in for 3-6 months while search)

---

## System Administration

### HR System / HRIS Integration

**Year 1-2**: Manual (Google Forms for reviews, Google Sheets for tracking, Google Drive for storage—free, functional but clunky)

**Year 3+**: HRIS with performance module (Gusto Performance Management $8/employee/month, BambooHR $6/employee/month, Lattice $11/employee/month—automates forms, reminders, aggregation)

**Features**:

- Goal tracking (employee updates progress quarterly—visible to manager)
- Review forms (digital, templated—send to employee → manager → COO for approval)
- 360-degree feedback (automated invites, anonymous responses, aggregated reports)
- Compensation management (merit increases calculated, imported to payroll)
- Reporting (performance distribution, goal completion rates, time-to-review)

---

### Training for Managers

**Manager Training** (Annually, March—before review season):

- **How to Give Feedback**: Specific, behavior-focused, timely (not "You're lazy"—"You missed 3 deadlines this quarter—let's discuss obstacles")
- **How to Conduct Review Meeting**: Structure, tone, active listening (90 minutes, collaborative not lecture, two-way conversation)
- **How to Rate Fairly**: Avoid bias (recency bias, halo effect, leniency/strictness—use rubric, examples, calibration)
- **How to Handle Difficult Conversations**: Low performance, PIP, termination (practice scenarios, COO support)

**Trainer**: COO (leads training) or external consultant (Nonprofit HR, SHRM—Year 2+ if budget allows)

**Duration**: 2-hour workshop (in-person or Zoom—role-plays, Q&A, templates provided)

---

### Timeline & Reminders

**COO Responsibilities** (Annual Calendar):

- **November**: Announce review timeline (email to all staff—review process, dates, expectations)
- **January**: Send self-assessment forms (due February 15)
- **January**: Launch 360-degree feedback surveys (2-week window)
- **February**: Compile 360 reports, send to managers
- **February**: Managers draft reviews (due February 28)
- **March**: Conduct review meetings (all employees by March 31)
- **Late March**: Calibration session (managers + COO)
- **April**: Finalize ratings, approve compensation (ED + COO)
- **May**: Communicate raises, bonuses (manager → employee)
- **May**: Goal setting for next year (manager + employee)
- **Quarterly**: Check-in reminders (email managers—"Q1 check-ins due by April 30")

**Manager Reminders**: Asana tasks (auto-created—"Q1 check-in with Jane due April 15," "Annual review prep for Jane due Feb 28")

---

## Conclusion: Performance Reviews = Mission Multiplier

**Foundation's Performance Philosophy Recap**:

- ✅ **Mission-Driven**: Individual success = organizational impact (reviews align employees to Alpha-1 awareness, patient support, research goals)
- ✅ **Growth-Oriented**: 80% forward-looking (development, goals), 20% backward-looking (past year)—focus on building talent, not punishing mistakes
- ✅ **Fair & Consistent**: Same standards across roles (calibration prevents manager bias), evidence-based (data, examples, 360 feedback—not opinions)
- ✅ **Ongoing**: Quarterly check-ins + annual review (no surprises—employees know where they stand year-round)

**Success Metrics** (Track Annually):

- **Review Completion**: 100% of employees reviewed on time (by March 31—no delays)
- **Goal Achievement**: 70%+ of employees achieve 80%+ of SMART goals (high performance bar, attainable)
- **Employee Satisfaction**: Post-review survey (≥4/5 on "Review was fair," "Feedback was helpful," "Manager supported my development")
- **Retention of High Performers**: <10% turnover of "Exceeds"/"Exceptional" employees (losing top talent = system failure)
- **Improvement Plans**: 80%+ of PIP employees improve or exit (PIP works—either employee succeeds or Foundation makes tough termination decision)

**ROI of Robust Performance Management**:

- **Retention**: Clear career paths, development support, recognition → employees stay (reduce turnover cost $50K-$100K per replacement—recruiting, training, lost productivity)
- **Productivity**: Aligned goals, continuous feedback, accountability → higher output (employees deliver 10-20% more when expectations clear, motivated)
- **Engagement**: Employees feel valued (reviews = investment in their success, not just evaluation)—engaged employees = better patient service, more donor dollars, stronger research

**"Performance management isn't bureaucracy—it's how Foundation ensures every employee maximizes their impact. When people grow, patients thrive, donors give more, and research accelerates. That's mission success."**
