## 1. Overview & Legal Framework

### Why State Registration Matters

**Legal Requirement**: 41 states + DC require nonprofits to register before soliciting charitable contributions from residents. Solicitation = asking for donations (direct mail, email, social media, events, website donate button, peer-to-peer campaigns).

**Consequences of Non-Compliance**:

- **Fines & Penalties**: $500-$25,000 per violation (varies by state—some daily penalties accumulate)
- **Cease & Desist Orders**: State Attorney General can prohibit fundraising until registered
- **Lawsuits**: Donors can sue for fraud/misrepresentation if not properly registered
- **Reputational Damage**: News coverage of compliance failures erodes donor trust
- **Loss of Tax-Exempt Status**: Egregious violations can trigger IRS review of 501(c)(3) status

**Foundation Context**: Mark Egly Foundation solicits nationwide (website, social media, national awareness campaigns, research partnerships across states) = must register in most states.

---

### Federal vs. State Authority

**IRS (Federal)**:

- Grants 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status (Form 1023 already completed)
- Requires annual Form 990 filing (public disclosure of financials, governance, programs)
- Does NOT regulate charitable solicitation—that's state jurisdiction

**State Attorneys General & Secretaries of State**:

- Regulate charitable solicitation within their borders
- Require registration, annual reports, financial disclosures
- Enforce consumer protection laws (donors = consumers of charitable services)

---

## 2. Registration vs. Solicitation Licensing

### Two Types of State Compliance

**1. Foreign Qualification / Entity Registration**:

- Purpose: Authorize nonprofit to "do business" in state (open office, hire employees, hold property)
- Filed with: Secretary of State (usually Business Services division)
- Requirement: If Foundation establishes physical presence (office, employees) in state beyond home state (Ohio)
- Cost: $50-$200/state filing fee + $50-$150 annual report
- Example: If Foundation opens satellite office in California, must foreign qualify in California

**2. Charitable Solicitation Registration**:

- Purpose: Authorize soliciting donations from state residents
- Filed with: Attorney General or Secretary of State (Charities division)
- Requirement: If solicit donations from state residents (even remotely via website, mail, social media)
- Cost: $0-$400/state initial + annual renewal (see state matrix)
- Example: Foundation website has "Donate" button accessible to New York residents = must register in NY

**Key Distinction**: Can solicit without physical presence (charitable registration), but physical presence may trigger both registrations.

## 4. Unified Registration Statement (URS)

### What is URS?

**URS (Unified Registration Statement)**: Standardized multi-state registration form developed by National Association of State Charity Officials (NASCO) and National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG). Accepted by 41 states—file once, cover most states.

**Benefits**:

- Single form = efficiency (don't complete 41 different state forms)
- Covers: organization info, mission, governance, programs, financials, fundraising activities
- Attachments: IRS determination letter, Form 990, financial statements, board list

---

### URS Sections

**Part A: Organization Info** (legal name, EIN, address, registration states, entity type)

**Part B: Purpose, Programs, Activities** (mission statement, program descriptions, beneficiaries served)

**Part C: Directors, Officers, Key Personnel** (names, addresses, compensation—transparency for state regulators)

**Part D: Fundraising Activity** (revenue breakdown—contributions, grants, events, other; expenses—program, management, fundraising)

**Part E: Financial Information** (balance sheet summary, revenue/expense summary—extracted from Form 990)

**Part F: Professional Fundraisers** (if use paid solicitors or consultants—list name, address, compensation)

**Part G: Signature & Certification** (ED or Board Chair signs under penalty of perjury)

**Attachments**:

- IRS Form 1023 determination letter (501c3 approval)
- Most recent IRS Form 990 (public tax return)
- Audited financial statements (if required by state—typically if >$500K-$1M revenue)
- State-specific supplements (some states require additional forms despite accepting URS)

---

### Where to File URS

**Multi-State Portal Options**:

1. **HarbourCompliance.com** ($500-$2,500/year for multi-state filing service—recommended Year 1-2 for simplicity)
2. **CharityNet USA** (filing service + compliance calendar)
3. **Direct Filing**: Each state's Attorney General or Secretary of State Charities Division website (time-consuming—50+ hours/year for 41 states)

**Foundation Approach Year 1**: Use HarbourCompliance for initial 15-20 priority states (highest donor volume), expand to all 41 states Year 2-3.

---

## 5. Initial Registration Process

### Phase 1: Determine Where to Register

**Step 1: Analyze Donor Geography**:

- Review CRM (Salesforce): Where do donors live? (export mailing addresses, group by state)
- Review online donations: Google Analytics—visitor geography for markeglyfoundation.org/donate
- Review event registrations: Alpha-1 Awareness Month participants by state
- Review grants: Foundation/corporate grants by funder state

**Prioritization** (Year 1):

- **Tier 1** (Must register immediately): Home state (Ohio) + top 5 donor states (e.g., CA, NY, FL, TX, PA)
- **Tier 2** (Register by Month 6): States 6-15 by donor volume
- **Tier 3** (Register by Year 2): Remaining states with any donor activity
- **Skip** (Year 1-2): States with zero donors and no planned solicitation campaigns

---

### Phase 2: Prepare URS Package

**Gather Documents** (one-time prep, reuse annually):

- [ ] IRS determination letter (501c3 approval—received after Form 1023)
- [ ] Certificate of Incorporation (Ohio Secretary of State—Articles of Incorporation)
- [ ] Bylaws (current version, Board-approved)
- [ ] Form 990 (most recent filed—Year 1 may file 990-EZ if <$200K revenue)
- [ ] Financial statements (balance sheet, income statement—CPA-reviewed if budget allows, else internally prepared)
- [ ] Board of Directors list (names, addresses, affiliations—public info, demonstrates governance)
- [ ] Mission statement (1-2 paragraphs—from strategic plan or website About page)
- [ ] Program descriptions (Alpha-1 patient registry, patient navigation, research support, awareness campaigns—3-5 sentences each)

**Complete URS Form**:

- Use online URS tool (HarbourCompliance portal or CharityNet) or PDF fillable form
- Answer all questions accurately (states cross-check with Form 990—discrepancies trigger audit)
- ED and Board Chair review before signature

---

### Phase 3: File State-by-State

**Filing Methods**:

- **Online Portal** (preferred): Most states accept electronic filing (faster, confirmation receipt)
- **Mail**: Some states require paper + check (Florida, North Carolina—slower, 4-8 weeks processing)
- **Service Provider**: HarbourCompliance handles filing logistics (submit once, they distribute to states)

**Processing Time**: 2-8 weeks per state (plan ahead—don't wait until solicitation campaign launch)

**Confirmation**: Save registration certificates/confirmation emails (audit trail—states may not send physical certificates)

---

## 6. Annual Renewal & Reporting

### Renewal Requirements

**All 41 states require annual renewal** (even if no fundraising activity—must file or formally withdraw registration)

**Renewal Components**:

1. **Updated URS** (if financials changed significantly) OR state-specific renewal form
2. **Updated Form 990** (year just filed with IRS)
3. **Renewal Fee** (varies by state—see matrix)
4. **Financial Statements** (if revenue threshold met—e.g., CA requires audit if >$2M)

**Deadlines**: Vary by state (see matrix)—most common:

- **4.5 months after FYE** (fiscal year-end): Many states (CA, MA, OR, PA, TN, VA)
- **6 months after FYE**: Many states (AK, CT, HI, ME, NH, NJ, NY, WI)
- **Anniversary of registration**: Some states (AL, CO, IL, KS, LA, MS, MO, ND, OK, UT)

**Example** (Foundation FYE = December 31):

- **May 15**: Renewal due in 4.5-month states (CA, MA, OR, PA, TN, VA)
- **June 30**: Renewal due in 6-month states (AK, CT, HI, ME, NH, NJ, NY, WI)
- **Various**: Anniversary states based on initial registration date

- **January**: Finalize Form 990 with accountant (due May 15 or November 15 with extension)
- **February**: File Form 990 with IRS electronically (e-file mandatory if >$50K revenue)
- **March-July**: File state renewals in batches (4.5-month states in May, 6-month states in June, anniversary states throughout year)
- **August-December**: Monitor confirmation receipts, address state questions/audits, plan next year

**Tool**: Google Calendar with state-specific renewal reminders (recurring annually) OR HarbourCompliance dashboard (tracks deadlines, sends alerts)

---

## 7. Exemptions & Thresholds

### Common Exemptions

**Revenue-Based Exemptions** (varies by state):

- **Alabama**: <$25K gross revenue → exempt
- **Arizona**: <$50K gross revenue OR <$25K from AZ residents → exempt
- **Colorado**: <$25K solicited → register anyway (low threshold)
- **Pennsylvania**: <$25K revenue AND all volunteers (no paid staff/fundraisers) → exempt

**Religious Organization Exemption**: Many states exempt churches, synagogues, mosques—but NOT religious nonprofits like foundations (Foundation = not exempt under religious exception)

**Membership Organizations**: Some states exempt if solicit only members (not applicable—Foundation solicits general public)

---

### Claiming Exemptions

**Risks**:

- Revenue can spike unpredictably (major donor gift, viral campaign pushes over threshold mid-year)
- "Solicitation" defined broadly (website donate button = solicitation in all states website accessible from)
- States may challenge exemption claims (audit, demand proof)

**Foundation Strategy**: Register proactively (don't rely on exemptions)—compliance easier than defending exemption + penalties more expensive than registration fees

---

## 8. Online Fundraising Considerations

### Charleston Principles (NASCO Guidance)

**Issue**: Internet has no borders—donate button on Foundation website accessible to all 50 states. Must register in all 41 states that require registration?

**Charleston Principles** (2001, updated 2019):

- **Passive Website** (general info, no solicitation): May not trigger registration
- **Active Solicitation** (donate button, specific appeals, online campaigns): Triggers registration in states where:
  - Foundation specifically targets state (geo-targeted ads, state-specific appeals)
  - Foundation receives donations from state repeatedly/regularly
  - Foundation has other contacts in state (events, volunteers, board members, grant relationships)

**Practical Standard**: If receive donations from state ≥2 times/year OR plan solicitation campaign targeting state → register

---

### Foundation Website & Social Media

**Foundation Context**:

- Website (markeglyfoundation.org) has donate button (Stripe, PayPal)—accessible nationwide
- Social media (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter) posts link to donate page—nationwide reach
- Email marketing (Mailchimp) to national subscriber list—includes donors across states
- Peer-to-peer campaigns (Facebook Fundraisers, GoFundMe) organized by patients/supporters—unpredictable geography

**Conclusion**: Foundation solicits nationwide → must register in all 41 states (or at minimum top 20-25 donor states Year 1, expand to all 41 by Year 3)

---

### Donor Data & Tracking

**COO Maintains** (Salesforce CRM):

- Donor mailing address (state field required—use for registration planning)
- Donation date and amount (track which states generate donations)
- Source (website, event, mail, peer-to-peer—helps assess solicitation patterns)

**Annual Review** (January): Export donor report by state → identify new states where received donations → register if not already compliant

---

## 9. Professional Fundraisers & Consultants

### State Requirements for Paid Fundraisers

**If Foundation hires professional fundraisers** (paid firms to solicit donations—telemarketing, direct mail firms, online fundraising platforms with fees), many states require:

- Fundraiser registers separately in each state (not Foundation's responsibility but Foundation must verify)
- Written contract between Foundation and fundraiser filed with state
- Disclosure to donors (some states require fundraiser disclose % of donation retained as fee)

**Foundation Year 1-2**: Unlikely to use professional fundraisers (staff-driven, volunteer-driven fundraising)—but if hire Grant Writer on commission or Fundraising Consultant who solicits directly, may trigger requirements

---

### Fundraising Counsel (Consultants)

**Distinction**:

- **Professional Fundraiser** (Solicitor): Directly asks for donations (telemarketer, paid canvasser)—heavily regulated
- **Fundraising Counsel** (Consultant): Advises on strategy, writes materials, but doesn't solicit—less regulated, often exempt

**Foundation Context**: Hiring Grant Writer or Development Consultant = fundraising counsel (exempt in most states)—but verify if consultant will solicit directly (calls to donors, asks at events = solicitor, not counsel)

---

## 10. Compliance Calendar & Tracking

### Annual Compliance Workflow

**January-March** (Prep Phase):

- Finalize Form 990 (accountant collaboration)
- Update URS with current financials, board list, program descriptions
- Review donor geography (identify new states needing registration)

**April-July** (Filing Phase):

- File state renewals in batches (deadlines vary—May, June, July)
- Pay renewal fees (check or credit card—track in accounting)
- Submit via HarbourCompliance portal or state online portals

**August-December** (Monitoring Phase):

- Track confirmation receipts (all states responded?)
- Address state questions (some states request clarification or additional docs)
- Update compliance tracker (spreadsheet or HarbourCompliance dashboard)

---

### Compliance Tracker (Spreadsheet)

**Columns**:

- State
- Registration status (Registered, Pending, Not Registered, Withdrawn)
- Initial registration date
- Renewal deadline
- Fee amount
- Confirmation number
- Last filed date
- Notes (exemptions claimed, audit history, state contacts)

**Owner**: COO (update quarterly—review at COO-ED-CFO monthly meeting)

---

## 11. Penalties & Enforcement

### State Enforcement Actions

**Common Violations**:

1. **Failure to Register**: Soliciting without registration (most common—$1K-$5K fine per state)
2. **Failure to Renew**: Missed renewal deadline (late fees $100-$500 + reinstatement fee)
3. **Misrepresentation**: Inaccurate URS or Form 990 (fraud investigation—rare but severe)
4. **Failure to File Financial Reports**: Missing audited financials when required (suspension of registration)

**Penalties**:

- **Civil Fines**: $500-$25,000 per violation (some states per-day penalties—can accumulate fast)
- **Cease & Desist**: State AG orders Foundation stop fundraising until compliant (immediate revenue loss)
- **Criminal Charges**: Rare—only if intentional fraud, embezzlement (not inadvertent compliance lapse)

---

### Notable State Enforcement Examples

**New York**: Aggressive enforcement—frequent audits, steep penalties ($10K+), publicizes enforcement actions (reputational harm)

**California**: High registration fees ($50) but strict compliance—requires audit if >$2M revenue, scrutinizes Form 990 discrepancies

**Florida**: High initial registration fee ($400) as barrier to non-serious orgs—audits common, quick to suspend non-compliant charities

**North Carolina**: Highest fees ($200/year)—vigorous enforcement, partners with IRS for data sharing

---

### Responding to State Inquiries

**If Receive Letter from State AG**:

1. **Don't Ignore**: Response required within 30 days (typically)—ignoring escalates to enforcement
2. **Consult Legal Counsel**: Especially if fraud allegation, penalty notice, or subpoena
3. **Gather Documents**: State requesting proof of registration, financials, or donor records—assemble promptly
4. **Respond in Writing**: Professional tone, factual, attach supporting docs (registration confirmation, Form 990, bank statements if requested)
5. **Remediate**: If out of compliance, register immediately, pay back fees, submit overdue reports

**COO Responsibility**: Monitor Foundation email and physical mail (state notices may go to registered agent address—ensure current)

---

## 12. Budget & Resource Planning

### Cost Estimate (Year 1-3)

**Year 1** (Initial Registration, 20 States):

- Registration fees: 20 states × avg $50 = $1,000
- HarbourCompliance service: $1,500 (initial setup + 1 year monitoring)
- Legal review (attorney review URS, state-specific questions): $1,000
- Staff time (COO—40 hours prep, filing, tracking): $2,000 (internal cost)
- **Total Year 1**: ~$5,500

**Year 2** (Expand to 41 States + Renewals):

- New registrations: 21 states × $50 = $1,050
- Renewals: 20 states × $50 = $1,000
- HarbourCompliance annual fee: $2,000 (all 41 states)
- Audit (if revenue >$500K—CPA audit required by some states): $5,000-$10,000
- Legal counsel: $500 (ad hoc questions)
- **Total Year 2**: ~$9,550-$14,550

**Year 3+** (Steady State, All States Registered):

- Annual renewals: 41 states × avg $50 = $2,050
- HarbourCompliance: $2,000
- Audit (if required): $5,000-$10,000
- Legal: $500
- **Total Year 3+**: ~$9,550-$14,550 annually

**Cost-Saving Tips**:

- File directly via state portals (skip HarbourCompliance—saves $2K/year but adds 30-50 hours COO time)
- Negotiate audit fee with CPA (nonprofit discount—some CPAs offer $3K-$5K audits for small orgs)
- Use volunteers or pro bono attorneys (corporate law firms often provide pro bono support)

---

### Return on Investment

**Why Worth the Cost**:

- **Legal Protection**: Fines for non-compliance $10K-$100K+ (avoid penalties)
- **Donor Confidence**: Registered nonprofits perceived as legitimate, professional (vs. unregistered = scam)
- **Access to Grants**: Some funders verify state registration before awarding grants (requirement in RFP)
- **Risk Mitigation**: Cease & desist order halts fundraising → lose $50K-$200K/year revenue (registration cost = insurance premium)

---

## 13. Tools & Vendors

### Compliance Service Providers

**HarbourCompliance** (Recommended):

- Website: harbourcompliance.com
- Services: Multi-state filing, renewal reminders, compliance dashboard, customer support
- Cost: $1,500-$3,000/year (depending on # states, org size)
- Pros: Saves time (40-60 hours/year), ensures deadlines met, expert guidance
- Cons: Recurring cost (budget annually)

**CharityNet USA**:

- Similar to HarbourCompliance—alternative vendor
- Cost: $1,200-$2,500/year

**Harbor Compliance** (different from HarbourCompliance—confusing names):

- Entity compliance (foreign qualification) + charitable registration
- Cost: Higher ($3K-$5K/year) but full-service (includes registered agent services)

---

### DIY Tools (Free/Low-Cost)

**NASCO Multi-State Filing Portal**:

- Website: multistatefiling.org
- Free portal (states cover cost)—file URS to multiple states at once
- Pros: Free, official state-endorsed
- Cons: Manual process per state, less user-friendly than commercial vendors

**State Websites**:

- Each state's AG or SOS Charities division website
- File directly (online or mail)
- Pros: Free (only pay state fees)
- Cons: Time-consuming (41 separate logins, forms, deadlines)

---

### Legal Counsel

**When to Hire Attorney**:

- Initial registration (Year 1—attorney reviews URS, ensures compliance): $1,000-$2,000
- State audit or enforcement action: $2,000-$10,000 (depending on complexity)
- Complex fundraising structures (if partner with for-profit, use of professional fundraisers): $1,500-$5,000

**Nonprofit Legal Specialists**:

- Local: Ohio nonprofit attorneys (Columbus Bar Association referral)
- National: Perlman & Perlman (NYC—national nonprofit practice), Adler & Colvin (SF—nonprofit tax specialists)

---

## 14. Audits & Investigations

### Types of State Audits

**Routine Compliance Audit**:

- State AG reviews filed reports (Form 990, URS, financials) for accuracy
- May request additional info (bank statements, donor records, board meeting minutes)
- Typically resolved with document submission (no penalty if minor discrepancies explained)

**Investigative Audit**:

- Triggered by complaint (donor alleges fraud, funds misused, misleading solicitation)
- State subpoenas records, interviews staff, may involve forensic accountant
- Can result in penalties, restitution orders, or consent decrees

**Random Audit**:

- Some states (NY, CA, NC) randomly select % of registered charities for detailed review annually
- Ensures systemic compliance (not complaint-driven)

---

### Preparing for Audit

**Best Practices**:

1. **Maintain Organized Records**: Financial records, board minutes, donor correspondence, policies—readily accessible
2. **Respond Promptly**: State auditors expect response within 10-30 days—don't delay
3. **Be Cooperative**: Professional tone, provide requested documents, don't obstruct
4. **Engage Counsel if Serious**: If criminal investigation or fraud allegation, hire attorney immediately (don't speak to auditors without counsel)
5. **Remediate Findings**: If audit identifies deficiencies (missing policies, inadequate board oversight), fix immediately and document corrective actions

---

## 15. Best Practices & Risk Mitigation

### Proactive Compliance Strategies

**1. Register Early & Broadly**:

- Don't wait until state contacts Foundation—register proactively in top donor states
- Avoid relying on exemptions (revenue thresholds unpredictable—register anyway)

**2. Use Compliance Service**:

- HarbourCompliance or CharityNet—worth cost for time savings and deadline tracking
- Frees COO to focus on mission, not compliance paperwork

**3. Centralize Donor Data**:

- CRM (Salesforce) tracks donor state, donation frequency—enables geographic analysis for registration planning
- Annual donor report by state (January—inform registration decisions)

**4. Monitor State Law Changes**:

- States periodically change fees, deadlines, thresholds—subscribe to NASCO newsletter, HarbourCompliance alerts
- Legal counsel monitors significant changes (e.g., CA increased audit threshold 2024)

**5. Document Everything**:

- Save registration confirmations, renewal receipts, state correspondence—audit trail
- If state claims non-compliance, can prove filed timely

**6. Train Staff on Solicitation Policies**:

- All staff understand "solicitation" definition (asking for donations = solicitation—includes social media posts, email appeals, event invites)
- Before launching campaign targeting new state, verify registered in that state

**7. Avoid Common Mistakes**:

- ❌ Assuming "small nonprofit" exempt (revenue thresholds low—$25K in many states)
- ❌ Filing Form 990 with IRS but forgetting state renewals (separate requirements)
- ❌ Using outdated URS (must update annually with current financials, board)
- ❌ Ignoring anniversary deadlines (easy to forget—set recurring calendar reminders)

| Missed renewal deadline                   | Medium                    | Medium ($100-$500 late fee, temporary suspension)            | HarbourCompliance alerts, Google Calendar reminders (6-week lead time)          |
| Soliciting in unregistered state          | High (Year 1—unknowingly) | High (cease & desist, $1K-$5K fine)                          | Proactive registration in top 20 donor states Year 1                            |
| State audit of financials                 | Low                       | Medium (administrative burden, possible deficiency findings) | Maintain organized records, CPA-reviewed financials                             |
| Donor complaint triggers investigation    | Low                       | High (reputational harm, legal fees $5K-$20K)                | Transparent communications, accurate donor records, prompt complaint resolution |
| Revenue spike exceeds exemption threshold | Medium (viral campaign)   | Low (can register retroactively if act quickly)              | Don't rely on exemptions—register proactively                                   |

## Conclusion: Compliance as Foundation for Growth

**State registration and charitable solicitation compliance = operational hygiene**—not optional, not deferrable. Failure to register jeopardizes Foundation's ability to fundraise, damages reputation with donors and grantmakers, and exposes organization to financial penalties and legal liability.

**Foundation's Compliance Roadmap**:

- **Year 1**: Register in Ohio (home state) + top 15-20 donor states, establish compliance calendar, engage HarbourCompliance
- **Year 2**: Expand to all 41 required states, complete first renewal cycle, conduct internal audit of donor geography
- **Year 3+**: Maintain steady-state compliance (annual renewals, proactive monitoring, legal updates)

**Investment** ($10K-$15K/year Year 2+) **= Insurance Premium** (protects $500K-$1M+ annual fundraising revenue, preserves 501c3 status, maintains donor trust).

**"Compliance done right is invisible—donors never see it, but its absence destroys everything."**
