## Media Relations Philosophy

### Foundation's Media Strategy

**Mission**: Leverage media to raise AATD awareness, educate public and healthcare providers, advocate for patients, and position Foundation as authoritative voice.

**Core Principles**:

**1. Proactive & Responsive**
- Don't wait for media to find us—pitch stories, build relationships, offer expert commentary
- When media calls, respond quickly (within 2 hours during business hours)

**2. Patient-Centered Storytelling**
- Every media opportunity should advance patient interests (awareness, diagnosis, treatment access, research)
- Humanize AATD with patient stories (with consent)—statistics inform, stories inspire

**3. Science-Based Accuracy**
- All medical/scientific claims verified by Medical Advisory Board
- Never overstate research findings or promise cures
- Correct misinformation immediately (even if embarrassing)

**4. Transparency & Authenticity**
- Honest about challenges (diagnostic gaps, treatment costs, unmet needs)
- Don't dodge hard questions—address with empathy and facts
- Disclose Foundation funding sources when relevant

**5. Strategic Opportunism**
- Tie AATD awareness to news cycles (rare disease day, lung health month, genetic testing breakthroughs)
- Monitor for earned media opportunities (celebrity diagnosis, FDA approvals, research publications)

---

### Media Relations vs. Crisis Communications

**Media Relations** (This Document):
- Proactive storytelling, relationship building, positive coverage
- Goal: Increase AATD awareness, establish Foundation credibility

**Crisis Communications** (See Document 19: Crisis Management Plan):
- Reactive damage control, reputation protection
- Goal: Minimize harm, restore trust, correct misinformation
- **Key Difference**: Crisis = Board-level oversight, holding statements, legal counsel; Media Relations = day-to-day operations

**Crossover**: Media training prepares spokespersons for both routine interviews AND crisis scenarios.

## Spokesperson Designation & Training

### Official Spokespersons

**Primary Spokesperson**: Executive Director
- **Topics**: All Foundation matters (mission, programs, advocacy, fundraising)
- **Media Types**: All (print, TV, radio, podcast)
- **Availability**: 24/7 for crisis, business hours for routine

**Secondary Spokespersons**:
- **Chief Medical Officer or Medical Advisory Board Chair**: Clinical/scientific topics (research, treatment, diagnosis)
- **Patient Advocate or Board Member with AATD**: Patient perspective, lived experience
- **Development Director**: Fundraising events, donor stories (non-financial specifics)

**Backup Protocol**: If primary unavailable, Communications Manager contacts secondary in order of priority.

---

### Media Training

**Annual Media Training** (All Spokespersons):
- **Provider**: PR firm or media training consultant ($2,000-$5,000/day)
- **Format**: Half-day workshop (4 hours)
- **Components**:
  1. **Message Development** (1 hour): Craft 3 key messages, practice "bridging" (redirecting questions to key messages)
  2. **Mock Interviews** (2 hours): On-camera practice (print, TV, adversarial), video playback analysis
  3. **Crisis Scenarios** (1 hour): Hostile questions, "gotcha" moments, how to avoid traps

**Example Mock Interview Questions**:
- ✅ **Routine**: "What is AATD and why should people get tested?"
- ⚠️ **Tough**: "Your Form 990 shows your ED earns $150K—isn't that excessive for a small nonprofit?"
- 🔴 **Crisis**: "A patient claims your support group gave medical advice that led to harm—your response?"

---

**Media Training Outcomes** (Measurable):
- Spokesperson can deliver 3 key messages within 60 seconds (TV interview soundbite)
- Spokesperson avoids "no comment" (always offers context, even if limited info available)
- Spokesperson maintains composure under pressure (measured by video analysis—no defensive body language)

---

## Press Release Development

### When to Issue Press Release

**Yes, Issue Press Release**:
- ✅ Major organizational milestone (new program launch, $1M fundraising milestone, staff hiring)
- ✅ Research findings (peer-reviewed publication, clinical trial results—if Foundation-funded)
- ✅ Advocacy victory (policy change, FDA approval of new AATD therapy)
- ✅ Major partnership (pharmaceutical company, academic institution, patient organization)
- ✅ Annual awareness campaigns (Rare Disease Day, Alpha-1 Awareness Month)
- ✅ Events (gala, walk, patient conference—1 week prior for event preview, day-of for recap)

**No, Don't Issue Press Release**:
- ❌ Minor operational updates (new website, staff promotions below C-suite)
- ❌ Internal milestones (Board meeting, committee formation—unless newsworthy decision)
- ❌ Routine programs (monthly support group—not newsworthy unless first in new city)

**Rule of Thumb**: If it's not interesting to journalist covering AATD, don't issue. Better to send 6 high-quality releases/year than 24 low-quality.

## Interview Preparation & Best Practices

### Pre-Interview Checklist

**24 Hours Before Interview**:
- [ ] Confirm: Time, date, format (phone/video/in-person), duration
- [ ] Research journalist: Read past articles, understand their angle
- [ ] Develop talking points: 3 key messages, supporting facts, patient stories
- [ ] Anticipate questions: List 10 likely questions, draft answers
- [ ] Gather materials: AATD fact sheet, Foundation one-pager, patient photos (if applicable)
- [ ] Practice: Rehearse talking points aloud, time responses (30-60 seconds each)

---

### Interview Best Practices

**The 3 Cs**:
1. **Clear**: Use plain language (no jargon—say "genetic lung disease," not "serine protease inhibitor deficiency")
2. **Concise**: 30-60 second answers (reporters edit long responses, you lose control)
3. **Compelling**: Lead with impact ("75% undiagnosed means 75,000 Americans living with preventable lung damage")

**Bridging Technique** (Redirect to Key Messages):
- **Reporter asks**: "How much does your ED earn?"
- **Bridge**: "Our ED's compensation is within industry standards for nonprofits our size, which is important because it allows us to attract top talent to serve AATD patients. Let me tell you about our impact—last year we helped 200 patients get diagnosed..."
- **Key**: Acknowledge question → Pivot to key message

**Avoid**:
- ❌ "No comment" (sounds guilty—instead: "I don't have that information now, but I'll follow up")
- ❌ "Off the record" (nothing is truly off-record—assume everything is quotable)
- ❌ Speculation ("I think," "Maybe," "Probably"—stick to facts)
- ❌ Negative language ("We're struggling," "We failed"—reframe: "We're growing to meet demand," "We learned valuable lessons")

---

### TV Interview Specifics

**Appearance**:
- **Wardrobe**: Solid colors (blue, gray, burgundy—avoid white, black, patterns), professional but approachable
- **Grooming**: Minimal jewelry (avoid jangly bracelets), hair out of face, light makeup (prevents shine on camera)

**Body Language**:
- **Eye contact**: Look at interviewer, not camera (unless direct-to-camera shot)
- **Posture**: Sit forward slightly (engaged), hands visible (use gestures, but not excessive)
- **Smile**: Warm, but appropriate to topic (don't smile when discussing patient suffering)

**Technical**:
- **Microphone check**: Test audio before live segment
- **Background**: Ensure professional setting (Foundation office, bookshelf—not busy café)
- **Lighting**: Face light source, avoid backlighting (silhouette)

---

## Message Development & Talking Points

### Core Foundation Messages

**Message 1: AATD is Underdiagnosed & Serious**
> "Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency affects 1 in 2,500 Americans—100,000 people—but 75% don't know they have it. Without diagnosis, patients suffer preventable lung and liver damage. A simple blood test can identify AATD and open access to life-saving treatments."

**Message 2: Foundation Bridges Diagnostic Gap**
> "The Mark Egly Foundation connects patients with genetic testing, expert pulmonologists, and peer support. Last year, our patient navigation program helped 200 people get diagnosed—200 lives changed by knowing their genetic status and accessing treatment."

**Message 3: Research & Advocacy Drive Progress**
> "We fund cutting-edge research ($500K in grants annually) and advocate for policy changes to improve AATD care. Our recent advocacy helped expand insurance coverage for genetic testing, benefiting thousands of patients nationwide."

**Usage**: Spokespersons memorize these messages, work into every interview (2-3 times per 10-minute interview).

---

### Issue-Specific Talking Points

**Topic: Genetic Testing**
- ✅ "Everyone with COPD or unexplained liver disease should be tested for AATD—it's a simple blood test"
- ✅ "Genetic testing empowers patients with knowledge and connects them to targeted therapies"
- ✅ "We provide free genetic counseling to help patients understand results and implications for family members"

**Topic: Treatment Access**
- ✅ "Augmentation therapy can slow AATD lung decline, but insurance coverage is inconsistent"
- ✅ "Our patient assistance program helps navigate insurance denials and connects patients with financial aid"
- ✅ "Patients shouldn't have to choose between life-saving treatment and bankruptcy"

**Topic: Research Funding**
- ✅ "We fund researcher-initiated grants ($50K-$150K) focused on improving diagnosis, treatment, and quality of life"
- ✅ "Our research priorities are set by patients—we ask what matters most to their daily lives"
- ✅ "Every research dollar invested today means better outcomes for patients tomorrow"

---

## Media Pitching Strategies

### Pitch Development

**Pitch = 3 Sentences**:
1. **Hook**: Why this story matters now (news peg, timely angle)
2. **Story**: What makes it compelling (patient journey, data, visual elements)
3. **Ask**: What you're offering (exclusive interview, access to patient, expert commentary)

**Example Pitch** (Email to Health Reporter):
> **Subject: Story Idea—Rare Genetic Disease Hides in Plain Sight (75% Undiagnosed)**
>
> Hi [Reporter Name],
>
> With Rare Disease Day approaching (Feb 28), I wanted to pitch a story on Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD)—a genetic lung/liver disease affecting 100,000 Americans, yet 75% don't know they have it.
>
> I can connect you with Sarah, a 42-year-old mother of three who was misdiagnosed with asthma for 15 years before a simple genetic test revealed AATD. Her story illustrates why genetic testing matters—and how patients suffer when diagnosis is delayed.
>
> Would you be interested in a 10-minute call this week to discuss? I can also provide AATD fact sheets, patient photos, and expert interviews.
>
> Best,
> [Communications Manager]
> Mark Egly Foundation
> media@markegly.org | (555) 123-4567

---

### Pitch Timing & News Pegs

**Annual Awareness Days** (Plan 6-8 Weeks Ahead):
- **Rare Disease Day** (Feb 28): Pitch AATD as rare disease example
- **Alpha-1 Awareness Month** (March—Foundation-designated): Media blitz
- **National Genetic Counseling Awareness Day** (Nov 8): Pitch genetic testing importance
- **Lung Health Month** (October): Pitch AATD as lung disease story

**Research Publication** (Coordinate with Journal Embargo):
- If Foundation-funded research published, pitch 2 weeks before embargo lifts (see Embargo Policies section)

**FDA Approval / Policy Change**:
- New AATD therapy approved → Pitch within 24 hours (patient access angle)

**Seasonal Health Stories**:
- Winter: "Cold or COPD? When breathlessness signals genetic condition"
- Spring: "Allergy season alert—AATD symptoms often mistaken for allergies"

---

## Press Kit Contents & Distribution

- USB drive (photos, fact sheets, logos—all digital assets)

**When to Use**: Gala, patient conference, press events (reporters present, hand out kits).

---

## Embargo Policies for Research Announcements

### What is Embargo?

**Definition**: Agreement between journal/researcher and media—reporters receive research findings early (for story preparation) but cannot publish until embargo lifts (typically journal publication date).

**Purpose**:
- Ensures accurate reporting (journalists have time to read full study, interview experts)
- Creates "news wave" (multiple outlets publish simultaneously → bigger impact)

---

### Foundation's Embargo Policy

**If Foundation Funds Research Published in Peer-Reviewed Journal**:

1. **Coordinate with Journal**: Contact journal's press office 4 weeks before publication
   - Confirm embargo date/time (usually 12:01 AM ET on publication date)
   - Request advance copy of study (under embargo)

2. **Develop Press Materials** (2 weeks before embargo):
   - Press release (summarizes findings, quotes researchers + Foundation ED)
   - Patient perspective statement (how findings impact patients)
   - Lay summary (translates science into plain language)

3. **Embargo Distribution** (1 week before embargo):
   - Send press release + study to 50-100 journalists marked **"EMBARGOED UNTIL [DATE/TIME]"**
   - Offer researcher + ED interviews (under embargo)

4. **Embargo Lift** (Publication Day):
   - Post press release publicly (website, social media)
   - Pitch follow-up stories ("What This Means for AATD Patients" angles)

**Embargo Violation** = publishing before lift time → journal/researchers blacklist violator, Foundation loses credibility. **Never break embargoes.**

---

## Fact-Checking & Accuracy Procedures

### Pre-Publication Review

**When Reporter Offers Fact-Check** (Common for print, less for TV):
- ✅ **Accept opportunity**: "Yes, please send relevant sections—we want to ensure accuracy"
- ✅ **Review promptly**: 24-48 hour turnaround
- ✅ **Limit edits to factual errors**: Don't rewrite for tone or messaging (reporters resent heavy-handed edits)

**Example Corrections**:
- ✅ "Article states '1 in 5,000 Americans have AATD'—should be 1 in 2,500"
- ✅ "Quote attributes statement to ED—should be Medical Advisory Board Chair"
- ❌ "Article describes program as 'struggling to gain traction'—please change to 'growing rapidly'" (This is editorial judgment, not factual error)

---

### Internal Fact-Check Process (Before Foundation Issues Statement)

**All Press Releases/Talking Points Reviewed By**:
1. **Communications Manager**: Grammar, messaging, clarity
2. **Executive Director**: Strategic alignment, accuracy of Foundation info
3. **Medical Advisory Board** (if clinical/scientific content): Verify disease facts, treatment claims
4. **Legal Counsel** (if sensitive): Review for defamation risk, privacy compliance

**Review Timeline**: Allow 3-5 business days for internal review before distributing press release.

---

## Media Monitoring & Measurement

### What to Monitor

**Daily Monitoring** (Automated Alerts):
- **Google Alerts**: Set alerts for "Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency," "AATD," "Mark Egly Foundation"
- **Social Media Monitoring**: Mention tracking on Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram (Hootsuite, Sprout Social)
- **News Aggregators**: Google News, Feedly (RSS feeds for AATD keywords)

**Weekly Monitoring** (Manual Review):
- **Broadcast Monitoring**: TV News Archive (search transcripts for AATD mentions)
- **Podcast Monitoring**: Podcast search engines (Apple Podcasts, Spotify—search AATD)

---

### Media Measurement Metrics

**Quantitative Metrics**:
- **Impressions**: Total potential audience (e.g., NYT article reach = 10M daily readers)
- **Article Count**: # of articles/segments mentioning Foundation (goal: 50+/year by Year 5)
- **Share of Voice**: Foundation mentions vs. competitor organizations (track NORD, other rare disease orgs)
- **Advertising Equivalency** (AVE): Value if paid for coverage (e.g., full-page NYT ad = $150K—article = "earned $150K")

**Qualitative Metrics**:
- **Sentiment**: Positive, neutral, negative (track ratio—goal: 90%+ positive/neutral)
- **Message Penetration**: Do articles include Foundation's 3 key messages? (track %)
- **Spokesperson Performance**: Was ED quoted accurately? On-message? (review each clip)

---

### Media Monitoring Tools

**Free Tools**:
- Google Alerts ($0)
- Social media platform search ($0)
- TV News Archive ($0—public access)

**Paid Tools** (Year 3+, Budget $2,000-$8,000/year):
- **Meltwater**: Media monitoring, sentiment analysis, competitor tracking ($3,000-$6,000/year)
- **Cision**: Media database + monitoring ($5,000-$10,000/year)
- **Critical Mention**: Broadcast monitoring (TV, radio) ($2,000-$4,000/year)

**ROI**: If monitoring identifies 1 major media opportunity (e.g., reporter seeking AATD expert, Foundation spokesperson featured on NBC Nightly News = 5M impressions), tool pays for itself.

---

## Post-Interview Follow-Up

### Immediate Follow-Up (Same Day)

**Thank-You Email**:
> Hi [Reporter Name],
>
> Thank you for the interview today! I enjoyed discussing AATD awareness with you.
>
> As promised, attached are:
> - AATD fact sheet
> - High-res photo of [patient/ED/event]
> - Contact info for follow-up questions
>
> If you need anything else, don't hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to seeing the story!
>
> Best,
> [Communications Manager]

---

### Post-Publication Follow-Up

**Once Article Published**:
1. **Share Coverage**: Post to Foundation social media, email newsletter
2. **Thank Reporter**: Email appreciation ("Great piece! Our patients found it helpful")
3. **Maintain Relationship**: Add to "friendly journalists" list (pitch future stories)
4. **Evaluate Performance**: Review article—were key messages included? Accurate? Tone positive?

**If Coverage Negative**:
- Review internally (ED + Communications Manager): Justified criticism or misinformation?
- If justified, address issues (improve programs, transparency)
- If misinformation, consider correction request (see next section)

---

## Correction & Clarification Procedures

### When to Request Correction

**Request Correction If**:
- ✅ Factual error (incorrect statistics, misattributed quotes, wrong program details)
- ✅ Misrepresentation causing harm (e.g., article says Foundation doesn't serve patients of color—factually untrue, damages reputation)

**Don't Request Correction If**:
- ❌ Unflattering but accurate portrayal (article notes ED salary is high—factually correct per 990)
- ❌ Editorial judgment (reporter emphasizes challenges over successes—their prerogative)

---

### Correction Request Process

**Step 1: Contact Reporter** (Not Editor—Start at Source)
> Hi [Reporter Name],
>
> Thank you again for covering AATD awareness. I noticed one factual error in the article: it states "1 in 5,000 Americans have AATD," but the correct prevalence is 1 in 2,500.
>
> Would you be able to correct this? Accurate prevalence data is important for public awareness.
>
> Thank you,
> [Communications Manager]

**Step 2: If Reporter Unresponsive, Contact Editor**
> Hi [Editor Name],
>
> I reached out to [Reporter] about a factual error in [Article Title] but haven't heard back. The article states incorrect AATD prevalence (1 in 5,000 vs. correct 1 in 2,500).
>
> Could you issue a correction? We want to ensure accurate rare disease information.
>
> Thank you,
> [Communications Manager]

**Step 3: If Still Unresponsive, Consider**:
- Public response (social media thread correcting error—rare, only if error egregious)

## Crisis Communication Protocols

### When Media Relations Becomes Crisis

**Triggers** (Escalate to Crisis Mode):
- 🔴 Investigative story targeting Foundation (fraud allegations, patient harm claims)
- 🔴 Multiple negative articles in short timeframe (reputation attack)
- 🔴 Viral social media crisis (angry patient/donor post goes viral)
- 🔴 Legal issue with media implications (lawsuit filed, regulatory investigation)

**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Alert Executive Director + Board Chair** (within 1 hour)
2. **Consult Legal Counsel** (before responding)
3. **Activate Crisis Communication Plan** (Document 19—holding statements, spokesperson protocols)
4. **Monitor 24/7** (media mentions, social media)

**See Document 19: Crisis Management Plan for full protocols.**

### Holding Statements

**Use When**: Need to respond quickly but lack full information.

**Template**:
> "We are aware of [issue] and take it very seriously. We are reviewing the matter thoroughly and will provide more information as soon as possible. The Foundation's priority is always the wellbeing of AATD patients."

**Never**: "No comment" (implies guilt or evasion).
