## Crisis Communication Philosophy

### Why Communication Matters in Crisis

**Reality**: In crisis, perception = reality. Foundation's reputation built over years can collapse in hours if communication mishandled.

**Golden Rule**: **Communicate early, often, transparently**—even if information limited.

**Core Principles**:

**1. Speed Over Perfection**
- **First 2 Hours Critical** (news cycle, social media amplification)—get holding statement out, even if incomplete
- "No comment" interpreted as guilt—always say *something* (even "We're investigating")
- Speed builds trust ("They're on it"), silence breeds speculation

**2. One Voice**
- **Designated spokesperson** (usually ED, backup Communications Manager)—all media inquiries directed to them
- Prevent mixed messages (Board member says one thing, staff another—confuses public)
- Staff reminded: "Refer media to [spokesperson], don't improvise"

**3. Transparency & Honesty**
- **Admit what you know, don't know** ("We're investigating X, should have answers by Y")
- **Own mistakes** ("We made an error, here's how we're fixing it")—apology beats defensiveness
- **Never lie** (always discovered, destroys credibility permanently—Enron, Theranos)

**4. Empathy First**
- **Acknowledge harm** ("We're deeply sorry patients were affected")—before explaining circumstances
- **Human language** ("We failed" > "A process breakdown occurred"—take responsibility, no jargon)
- **Show action** ("Here's what we're doing to make it right"—concrete steps)

**5. Stakeholder Focus**
- **Patients First** (always)—their wellbeing > organizational reputation
- **Donors/Funders** (need reassurance funds used properly)
- **Staff** (internal communication before external—avoid learning from news)

---

### What is Crisis Communication?

**Definition**: Planned, rapid dissemination of information during crisis to:
- Inform stakeholders accurately (prevent rumors)
- Maintain trust and credibility
- Mitigate reputational damage
- Coordinate response (ensure everyone saying same thing)

**NOT**:
- ❌ PR spin/cover-up (transparency, not obfuscation)
- ❌ Legal defense (communication ≠ legal strategy—coordinate but distinct)
- ❌ Marketing campaign (crisis ≠ opportunity to promote—tone matters)

---

## Crisis Communication Team

### Team Structure

**Crisis Communication Team (CCT)** (Subset of Crisis Management Team):

| **Role**                   | **Person**                | **Responsibilities**                                      | **Contact**          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Lead**                   | Executive Director        | Final approval on all messages, primary spokesperson      | [Cell] [Email]       |

- **Response Time**: 24 hours
- **Spokesperson**: Communications Manager (ED notified, not lead)

**Level 2: Moderate** (Regional, External Stakeholders, Some Media Interest)
- **Examples**: Patient complaint (public), grant suspension, minor financial irregularity, vendor dispute
- **Communication Scope**: Internal + affected stakeholders + proactive media statement
- **Response Time**: 4-6 hours (holding statement), 24 hours (detailed update)
- **Spokesperson**: ED (primary), Communications Manager (backup)

**Level 3: Major** (National, Widespread Media, Significant Reputational Threat)
- **Examples**: Executive misconduct, major data breach (500+ records), patient harm, fraud allegation, IRS audit/penalties
- **Communication Scope**: All stakeholders + proactive media outreach + press conference
- **Response Time**: 1-2 hours (holding statement), 6 hours (detailed update), ongoing (daily updates until resolved)

## Communication Hierarchy

### Who Gets Told First? (Notification Order)

**Principle**: Internal before external—staff/Board shouldn't learn from news.

**Notification Sequence** (Level 3 Crisis):

**Within 1 Hour**:
1. **Crisis Communication Team** (CCT activated, conference call)
2. **Board Chair** (phone call from ED—brief situation, actions taken)
3. **Legal Counsel** (if not already on CCT—assess liability, mandatory reporting)

**Within 2-4 Hours**:
4. **Full Board** (email + conference call if needed—detailed update, holding statement shared)
5. **All Staff** (emergency meeting if office open, otherwise email—same message as Board, emphasis on "refer media to ED")
6. **Directly Affected Stakeholders** (patients impacted by crisis, vendors involved—personal calls if <10 people, email if >10)

**Within 4-6 Hours**:
7. **Major Donors** ($10K+ annual—personal call from ED or Development Director)
8. **Key Partners** (collaborating organizations, research partners—email, follow-up call if high-profile)

**Within 6-12 Hours**:
9. **All Donors** (email blast—same message as public statement, but "you heard it from us first" framing)
10. **General Public** (website statement, social media, press release if media inquiries)

---

### Internal Communication (Staff)

**Emergency Staff Meeting** (If Crisis During Work Hours):
- **Convene within 2 hours** (all-hands, in-person or Zoom)
- **ED presents**: What happened, what we're doing, how it affects Foundation, role of staff
- **Q&A**: 10-15 minutes (staff fears, questions—address transparently)
- **Instructions**: "All media inquiries → Communications Manager, don't speculate on social media, we'll update you daily"

**Email Template** (If After Hours):

> **Subject: Important Update—[Crisis Name]**
>
> Team,
>
> I'm writing to inform you of a situation that requires immediate attention. [1-2 sentence description of crisis].
>
> **What We Know**: [Bullet points—facts only, no speculation]
> **Actions Taken**: [Steps Foundation has taken—investigation, suspension, legal counsel engaged]
> **Timeline**: [Expected resolution or next update date]
>
> **Your Role**:
> - If media contact you, refer them to [Communications Manager, phone/email]
> - Do not discuss on social media (even personal accounts—say "Foundation will release statement")
> - Check email daily for updates
>
> I know this is concerning. We'll get through this together with transparency and integrity. Questions? Email me directly or call [cell].
>
> [ED Signature]

---

## Holding Statement Templates

### What is Holding Statement?

**Purpose**: Buy time during first 1-4 hours when facts still emerging—acknowledge crisis, show action, promise updates (avoids "no comment" vacuum).

**Formula**: Acknowledge + Concern + Action + Timeline

---

### Template 1: General Crisis

> **FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

---

### Template 3: Financial Irregularity

> **Mark Egly Foundation Statement on Financial Review**
>
> The Foundation has identified a potential financial irregularity involving [briefly describe—e.g., "expense reimbursements," "grant accounting"]. We have self-reported to [IRS/state regulator] and engaged [forensic auditor] to conduct a comprehensive review.
>
> We are committed to full transparency and accountability. No programs have been impacted, and all donor funds remain secure and restricted as designated.
>
> We expect the audit to conclude by [date] and will publicly share findings. Our donors and the AATD community deserve nothing less than complete integrity.

---

### Template 4: Executive Misconduct

> **Mark Egly Foundation Board of Directors Statement**
>
> The Board has been made aware of allegations regarding [Executive Director/other leader]. We have placed [name] on administrative leave pending an independent investigation by [outside counsel/HR firm].
>
> [Interim leader name] will serve as Acting Executive Director during this period. All Foundation programs and operations continue without interruption.

---

## Social Media Lockdown Procedures

### When to Lock Down Social Media

**Triggers** (Temporarily Pause Normal Posting):
- 🔴 Level 3 crisis (executive misconduct, major scandal)
- 🔴 Coordinated attack (multiple users/bots posting negative content)
- 🔴 Misinformation spreading faster than Foundation can respond
- 🔴 Staff death or tragedy (out of respect, pause promotional content)

**Duration**: Usually 24-72 hours (until crisis messaging established, then resume selectively)

---

### Lockdown Steps

**Immediate Actions** (Within 1 Hour of Crisis Declaration):

1. **Pause Scheduled Posts**
   - Hootsuite/Buffer: Pause all queued posts (don't delete—may resume)
   - Reason: Avoid tone-deaf posts ("Join our gala!" while crisis trending—looks oblivious)

2. **Post Holding Statement**
   - Copy holding statement to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn
   - Pin post to top of page (ensures first thing people see)
   - Disable comments if being flooded with trolls (not ideal, but sometimes necessary—explain: "We're monitoring, comments temporarily paused")

3. **Monitor Mentions**
   - Assign staff to monitor @mentions, hashtags (use TweetDeck, Hootsuite streams)
   - Respond to questions with holding statement link (don't argue, don't get defensive)
   - Screenshot negative posts (evidence if defamation, but don't engage)

4. **Alert Staff**
   - Email all staff: "Social media lockdown in effect. Do NOT post about Foundation on personal accounts until further notice. Refer questions to Communications Manager."

---

### What to Post During Lockdown

**DO Post**:
- ✅ **Holding statement** (facts, actions, timeline)
- ✅ **Updates** (every 24-48 hours—"Here's what we've learned, next steps")
- ✅ **FAQs** ("We're getting questions about X. Here's answer.")
- ✅ **Correcting misinformation** ("We've seen false claims that X. Facts: Y.")

**DON'T Post**:
- ❌ **Promotional content** (event invites, donation asks—insensitive during crisis)
- ❌ **Unrelated fluff** (AATD facts, inspirational quotes—looks like ignoring crisis)
- ❌ **Defensive arguments** ("That's not true!" without evidence—escalates)

---

### When to Resume Normal Posting

**Criteria**:
- ✅ Crisis resolved or stabilized (investigation complete, corrective actions implemented)
- ✅ Media coverage subsided (no new articles for 48+ hours)
- ✅ Social sentiment shifted neutral or positive (comments less angry/fearful)
- ✅ ED approval ("We're ready to move forward")

**Resumption Strategy**:
- **Gradual** (don't immediately blast 5 posts—start 1-2/week, build back)
- **Acknowledge** (first post: "Thank you for your patience. We're moving forward stronger. Here's how: [link to resolution statement]")
- **Focus on mission** (back to patient stories, education—rebuild trust through service)

---

## Message Control & Approval

### One-Voice Protocol

**Rule**: All external communication during crisis must be approved by ED (or Board Chair if ED implicated).

**Approval Workflow**:

1. **Draft** (Communications Manager writes message—holding statement, update, FAQ)
2. **Legal Review** (Legal Counsel checks for liability, mandatory disclosures—30 min turnaround)
3. **ED Approval** (ED reads, edits, approves—phone/email "APPROVED" required)
4. **Board Chair Notification** (ED forwards approved message to Chair—FYI, not approval unless sensitive)
5. **Release** (Communications Manager posts to website, social media, emails to stakeholders)

**Bypass Protocol** (If ED Unreachable in Emergency):
- Communications Manager can release holding statement if ED unreachable after 2 hours AND crisis urgent (media calling, social media erupting)
- ED notified immediately after release
- Board Chair looped in

---

### Key Messages (Core Points to Repeat)

**Formula**: Every communication should include 3 key messages (repeated consistently across all channels—reinforces narrative).

**Example (Financial Irregularity Crisis)**:

**Key Message 1**: "We discovered the issue ourselves and immediately self-reported to regulators—demonstrates our commitment to transparency."

**Key Message 2**: "An independent forensic auditor is conducting a comprehensive review—we're not investigating ourselves, ensuring objectivity."

**Key Message 3**: "All programs continue without interruption, and donor funds remain secure—mission unaffected."

**Repetition**: ED says these in media interview, Communications Manager includes in stakeholder emails, Board Chair mentions in Board update—everyone aligned.

---

## Rumor Control Strategies

### Why Rumors Spread

**Crisis Vacuum**: When Foundation doesn't communicate fast enough, people fill void with speculation (often worst-case scenarios).

**Social Media Amplification**: False rumor can reach 100K people in 24 hours (faster than Foundation's correction).

**Emotional Contagion**: Fear/anger spreads faster than facts—"Foundation stole money!" more shareable than "Accounting error corrected."

---

### Rumor Monitoring

**Social Listening**:
- **Google Alerts**: "Mark Egly Foundation" + crisis keywords (scandal, fraud, lawsuit)—daily email digests
- **Social Media Monitoring**: TweetDeck for Twitter, Facebook search for posts mentioning Foundation
- **Staff Hotline**: Email/phone for staff to report rumors they hear ("Someone said Foundation is shutting down")

**Threshold for Response**: Respond if rumor reaches 1,000+ people OR comes from credible source (journalist, major partner).

---

### Rumor Response Framework

**Step 1: Assess Accuracy**
- **True**: Correct/apologize ("Yes, we made an error. Here's what happened and how we're fixing it.")
- **Partially True**: Clarify ("Some facts correct, but context missing. Here's full story.")
- **False**: Refute firmly ("This is categorically untrue. Here are facts.")

**Step 2: Choose Channel**
- **Social Media**: If rumor spreading on Twitter → respond on Twitter (where audience is)
- **Press Statement**: If rumor in news article → email correction to journalist, request retraction/clarification
- **Website FAQ**: If multiple rumors → create "Setting the Record Straight" webpage

**Step 3: Fact-Check Template**

> **Setting the Record Straight: [Rumor Topic]**
>
> We've seen misinformation circulating about [topic]. Here are the facts:
>
> **CLAIM**: [Quote rumor verbatim]
> **FACT**: [Correct information with evidence—link to audit, regulatory filing, etc.]
>
> **CLAIM**: [Another rumor]
> **FACT**: [Correction]
>
> We're committed to transparency. Questions? Email info@markegly.org or call [phone].
>
> [ED Signature]

---

## Dark Website Preparation

### What is Dark Site?

**Definition**: Pre-built crisis webpage (hidden from public until needed)—activated immediately when crisis hits, provides centralized hub for updates, FAQs, resources.

**Why?**: Saves time (don't scramble to build page during crisis), ensures consistent messaging, gives media/stakeholders single authoritative source.

---

### Dark Site Content (Pre-Written Templates)

**URL**: markegly.org/crisis-update (or /statement, /emergency)

**Page Elements**:

**Header**: "Important Update from Mark Egly Foundation"

**Latest Statement**: [Holding statement or detailed update—replaced as crisis evolves]

**Timeline**: Chronological updates (reverse chronological—newest first)
> **Nov 9, 2025, 10am**: Foundation became aware of [issue]
> **Nov 9, 2025, 2pm**: ED issued statement [link]
> **Nov 10, 2025, 9am**: Independent auditor engaged [link to press release]

**FAQ**: Anticipate questions
- What happened?
- Who is affected?
- What is Foundation doing?
- How can I help/get help?
- When will this be resolved?

**Contact**: Media inquiries (Communications Manager), Donor questions (Development Director), Patient concerns (Patient Navigator)

**Reassurance Box**: "Programs continue, donations secure, mission unchanged" (visible, calming)

---

### Activation Process

**Trigger**: Level 2-3 crisis (media coverage expected, stakeholders seeking information)

**Steps**:
1. **Communications Manager updates templates** (insert specific facts, dates, names)
2. **ED approves content** (30-minute review)
3. **IT publishes page** (make live, add to homepage banner—"Important Update: [link]")
4. **Promote**: Link from all social media posts, email signatures, press releases

**Deactivation**: When crisis resolved (replace with "Crisis Update Archive" page—transparency, shows "we learned from this")

---

## Media Bridging Techniques

### What is Bridging?

**Definition**: Technique for steering media interview back to Foundation's key messages (especially when journalist asks hostile/off-topic question).

**Formula**: Acknowledge question → Bridge to message → Deliver message

---

### Bridging Phrases

**Acknowledge + Bridge**:
- "That's a fair question, **and what's important to understand is**..." [key message]
- "I appreciate you asking that, **but let me put it in context**..." [key message]
- "Yes, **and here's what we're doing about it**..." [corrective action]
- "I understand the concern, **but the real issue is**..." [reframe to Foundation's narrative]
- "That's not quite accurate, **so let me clarify**..." [correct misinformation]

---

### Example Dialogue

**Journalist**: "Critics say the Foundation mismanaged donor funds. How do you respond?"

**ED** (Bridging):
"I understand why people have questions, **and that's exactly why we self-reported and engaged an independent auditor**. [Key Message 1: Transparency]. **What's important to know is** that all programs continue, every donor's contribution is being used as intended, and we're implementing new financial controls to ensure this never happens again. [Key Message 2: Mission continues]. **The real story here is** our commitment to accountability—we didn't hide this, we brought it to light ourselves."

---

### Difficult Question Responses

**"No Comment" Alternatives** (Never Say "No Comment"—Sounds Guilty):

**Instead**:
- ✅ "I can't discuss that specifically due to [legal/privacy] reasons, **but what I can tell you is**..." [what you CAN say]
- ✅ "We're still investigating, so I don't have complete information yet. **What I do know is**..." [confirmed facts]
- ✅ "That's not my area of expertise, **but I can connect you with [colleague] who can address that**."

**Hostile Framing** ("Isn't it true Foundation is just a scam?"):

**Don't**: Get defensive, argue with premise
**Do**: Reframe with facts
- ✅ "No, and here's why that's inaccurate: [facts]. Last year we served 200 patients, published audited financials showing 85% of funds to programs, and earned Charity Navigator 4-star rating. Our record speaks for itself."

---

## Post-Crisis Communication

### Transition from Crisis to Recovery

**Timing**: When crisis resolved (investigation complete, corrective actions implemented, media coverage subsided).

**Goals**:
- ✅ Close crisis narrative (provide resolution, not leave hanging)
- ✅ Rebuild trust (show Foundation learned, stronger now)
- ✅ Return to mission (shift focus back to patients, programs)

---

### Resolution Statement Template

> **FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**
> **Mark Egly Foundation: [Crisis] Resolution Update**
>
> Today, we are releasing the findings of [independent investigation/audit] into [crisis]. We are grateful for your patience and support during this difficult time.
>
> **Key Findings**:
> - [Bullet point summary—what happened, root causes]
>
> **Actions Taken**:
> - [Corrective measures—new policies, personnel changes, training]
>
> **Outcome**:
> - [Resolution—refunds issued, partnerships restored, programs resumed]
>
> **Looking Forward**:
> We have learned valuable lessons from this experience. [1-2 sentences on how Foundation is stronger, more accountable, better positioned to serve AATD community].
>
> We remain deeply committed to our mission: improving the lives of AATD patients through advocacy, education, and research. Thank you for standing with us.
>
> Full report available at: [link to detailed findings—transparency]
>
> [ED Signature]

---

### Thank You Communications

**After Crisis Resolved**, send personal thank-yous to:

**Board** (Handwritten note from ED):
> "Thank you for your leadership during [crisis]. Your steady guidance and public support made all the difference. I'm grateful to serve alongside you."

**Staff** (All-hands meeting + gift cards):
> "You kept Foundation running during chaos. Your professionalism and dedication to patients never wavered. Thank you."

**Major Donors** (Personal call from ED):
> "Your continued support during difficult time means everything. We didn't lose faith because you didn't lose faith in us. Thank you."

**Patients** (Newsletter):
> "Thank you for your patience. We never lost sight of our mission: serving you. Here's how we're moving forward together."

---

### Lessons Learned Report (Internal Only)

**Purpose**: Honest assessment of what went wrong, what went right, how to prevent recurrence (shared with Board, senior staff—not public unless legally required).

**Contents**:
1. **Crisis Timeline**: Detailed chronology (what happened when)
2. **Communication Performance**: What worked (fast holding statement), what didn't (delayed Board notification)
3. **Stakeholder Feedback**: Donor reactions, media coverage sentiment, patient concerns
4. **Recommendations**: Policy changes, training needs, process improvements
5. **Crisis Plan Updates**: Revise Crisis Communication Plan based on lessons learned

**Frequency**: After every Level 2-3 crisis (Level 1 = informal debrief, no formal report).

---

## 24/7 Contact Protocols

### Crisis Phone Tree

**Principle**: ED must be reachable 24/7 during crisis—no excuses.

**Primary Contact** (Executive Director):
- Cell: [Number] (call/text anytime)
- Backup: Home phone, spouse's cell

**If ED Unreachable** (After 30 Min):
- **Secondary**: Communications Manager [Cell]
- **Tertiary**: Board Chair [Cell]

**If All Unreachable** (Unlikely, But Plan):
- **Quaternary**: Legal Counsel [Cell]—makes holding statement decisions until ED available

---

### After-Hours Escalation

**Who Can Activate CCT After Hours?**
- ED (obviously)
- Communications Manager (if monitoring social media, sees crisis erupting)
- Board Chair (if receives crisis-related call)
- Legal Counsel (if receives legal threat, subpoena)

**Activation Method**: Group text to CCT phone numbers: "CRISIS ALERT: [1-sentence description]. Conference call in 30 minutes: [dial-in number]."

---

## Post-Crisis Debriefing

### Debrief Meeting (Within 7 Days of Resolution)

**Attendees**: Crisis Communication Team + any other involved staff

**Agenda** (90 minutes):
1. **What Happened** (10 min): Chronology recap
2. **Communication Performance** (30 min):
   - What did we do well? (Speed, transparency, message consistency?)
   - What could we improve? (Delayed notifications, confusing messages, poor media management?)
3. **Stakeholder Feedback** (20 min): What did Board, donors, patients, media say?
4. **Recommendations** (20 min): Specific changes to Crisis Communication Plan, training needs
5. **Action Items** (10 min): Who does what by when (update plan, schedule training, etc.)

**Output**: Written debrief memo (shared with Board, filed for future reference).

---

### Annual Crisis Simulation

**Purpose**: Test Crisis Communication Plan without real crisis—identify gaps, train new staff.

**Frequency**: Annually (or after major staff changes—new ED, Communications Manager)

**Scenario Examples**:
- "Patient dies after participating in Foundation-promoted clinical trial"
- "ED arrested for embezzlement"
- "Major donor publicly accuses Foundation of misleading fundraising"

**Simulation Steps**:
1. **Inject scenario** (9am Monday: "Breaking news: [scenario]")
2. **CCT activates** (conference call within 30 minutes)
3. **Draft holding statement** (60-minute deadline)
4. **Role-play media interview** (ED practices bridging with Communications Manager as hostile journalist)
5. **Debrief** (what worked, what didn't)

**Outcome**: Updated Crisis Communication Plan, staff confidence in protocols.

## Communication Audit Trail

### Documentation Requirements

**Why Document?**:
- Legal protection (shows Foundation acted responsibly, didn't cover up)
- Learning tool (review what worked in past crises)
- Board accountability (demonstrate communication decisions made thoughtfully)

**What to Document**:
- ✅ **All external communications** (holding statements, updates, press releases—save with timestamps)
- ✅ **Internal communications** (staff emails, Board updates—blind-copy Shared Drive)
- ✅ **Media coverage** (news articles, TV segments—screenshots/recordings)
- ✅ **Social media posts** (Foundation's posts + mentions—screenshots with timestamps)
- ✅ **Meeting notes** (CCT calls, Board discussions—summarize decisions, rationales)
- ✅ **Stakeholder contacts** (list of who was called/emailed when—spreadsheet)

## Integration with Crisis Management

### Coordination with Crisis Management Plan (Document 19)

**Two Plans, One Team**:
- **Crisis Management Plan** (Document 19): What to DO (operations—secure site, preserve evidence, engage counsel)
- **Crisis Communication Plan** (This document): What to SAY (messaging—inform stakeholders, manage reputation)

**Shared Team**: Crisis Management Team (CMT) includes Communications Manager—ensures communication integrated into overall response.

---

### Communication Roles Within CMT

**Crisis Management Team Structure** (From Document 19):
- **CMT Lead** (ED): Overall crisis response + primary spokesperson
- **Operations** (COO): Handle operational response (no communication role unless relaying facts to Communications Manager)
- **Legal**: Advise CMT Lead + review all communications
- **Communications Manager**: CCT Lead, drafts all messages, manages media

**Communication Workflow During Crisis**:
1. **CMT meets** (assess crisis, decide actions)
2. **Communications Manager attends CMT meeting** (hears firsthand what's happening, actions planned)
3. **Communications Manager drafts message** (based on CMT decisions)
4. **Legal reviews, ED approves** (message aligned with crisis response strategy)
5. **Communications Manager releases** (stakeholder notifications, media, social media)

---

### Crisis Severity Alignment

| **CMT Level** | **CCT Response**                                          | **Spokesperson**     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Level 1**   | Internal communication only (staff email)                 | Communications Mgr   |
| **Level 2**   | Internal + stakeholder emails + reactive media            | ED (primary)         |
| **Level 3**   | All stakeholders + proactive media + press conference     | ED (only)            |

## Conclusion

### Communication as Crisis Lifeline

**Bottom Line**: In crisis, Foundation's reputation lives or dies based on how it communicates. Fast, honest, empathetic communication = trust preserved. Slow, evasive, defensive communication = trust destroyed.

**Real-World Truth**: Nonprofits recover from mistakes—humans understand errors, forgive when accountability shown. But nonprofits rarely recover from cover-ups, lies, "no comment." Crisis communication isn't PR spin—it's moral obligation to stakeholders who trust Foundation with their money, health, hope.

- [ ] Save this plan to Shared Drive (CCT members have copies on phones—offline access)

**Annual Maintenance**:
- [ ] Update contact list (new Board Chair, staff changes)
- [ ] Conduct crisis simulation (test protocols, identify gaps)
- [ ] Review holding statement templates (ensure still relevant)
- [ ] Refresh media training (ED, Communications Manager—practice interviews)

**During Crisis**:
- [ ] Activate CCT (within 1 hour)
- [ ] Issue holding statement (within 2-4 hours)
