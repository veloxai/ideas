## Corporate Partnership Philosophy

### Why Partner with Corporations?

**Reality**: AATD Foundation needs resources (funding, expertise, patient reach)—corporations have resources but want value (brand visibility, patient access, scientific collaboration, CSR/ESG credibility).

**Win-Win**:
- **Foundation Gets**: Funding ($50K-$500K/year), in-kind support (free medications for patient assistance program, lab equipment for research partners), marketing reach (company's social media amplifies Foundation campaigns)
- **Corporation Gets**: Brand association with respected patient organization, insights into patient needs (inform drug development, service design), employee volunteer opportunities, tax deductions, ESG report content

**Core Tension**: Foundation must balance corporate funding (enables mission) with independence (perception = "pharma puppet" destroys patient trust).

---

### Guiding Principles

**1. Mission First, Money Second**
- ✅ Accept corporate partnerships that advance AATD patient outcomes (augmentation therapy manufacturer funds patient education—good)
- ❌ Decline partnerships that compromise mission (tobacco company wants to sponsor—no, smoking causes COPD, conflicts with lung health mission)

**2. Transparency & Disclosure**
- ✅ Publicly disclose all corporate funders (website lists "Corporate Partners," annual report shows revenue sources)
- ✅ Label sponsored content ("This educational webinar supported by [Company]")
- ❌ Hidden relationships (undisclosed pharma funding = scandal waiting to happen)

**3. Editorial Independence**
- ✅ Foundation retains full control over messaging (company can't approve Foundation's social media posts, policy positions, educational content)
- ❌ "Pay-to-play" (company pays $100K → demands Foundation endorse their drug over competitors—no)

**4. Patient Trust is Non-Negotiable**
- ✅ If partnership could erode patient trust (perception of bias, conflicts), decline—no amount of money worth destroying reputation
- ✅ Consult patient advisory committee before major corporate partnerships ("Would you trust Foundation if we partnered with X?")

---

## Types of Corporate Partners

### 1. Pharmaceutical Companies

**Profile**: Develop/manufacture AATD-related medications (augmentation therapy, symptomatic treatments, pipeline drugs).

**Partnership Opportunities**:
- **Unrestricted educational grants** ($50K-$250K/year—fund patient webinars, disease awareness campaigns, support groups, but no drug promotion)
- **Patient assistance programs** (company provides free/discounted medications to uninsured patients—Foundation refers patients, company fulfills)
- **Research funding** ($100K-$500K—sponsor investigator-initiated studies, patient registry, real-world evidence research)
- **Conference sponsorship** ($10K-$50K—support Foundation's annual AATD summit, exhibit booth, speaking slot)

**Typical Partners**: Grifols (augmentation therapy), CSL Behring (augmentation therapy), Takeda (rare disease portfolio), emerging biotech with AATD pipeline drugs

**Conflict Risk**: 🔴 HIGH (perception Foundation favors sponsor's drug over competitors)

---

### 2. Healthcare Corporations

**Profile**: Health systems, diagnostic labs, medical device companies, telehealth platforms.

**Partnership Opportunities**:
- **Genetic testing partnerships** (Foundation promotes AATD genetic testing, lab offers discounted/free testing to Foundation referrals—$50-$100/test vs. $200 retail)
- **Diagnostic device partnerships** (spirometer manufacturer donates devices to Foundation's patient education events—patients learn how to measure lung function)
- **Telehealth partnerships** (Foundation negotiates group rates for AATD patients—$30/visit vs. $75, platform gets patient volume)
- **Health system collaborations** (hospital system with AATD clinic partners with Foundation—co-sponsor patient events, shared social media campaigns)

**Typical Partners**: Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, pulmonary function test device companies, Teladoc, major health systems (Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic)

**Conflict Risk**: 🟡 MODERATE (less controversial than pharma, but must ensure patients not steered to specific provider unfairly)

---

### 3. Commercial Sponsors (Non-Healthcare)

**Profile**: Companies seeking CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) or cause marketing—not healthcare-related, but want to support rare disease advocacy.

**Partnership Opportunities**:
- **Event sponsorship** ($5K-$50K—sponsor Foundation's walk/gala, logo on t-shirts, booth at event)
- **Employee engagement** (company's 500 employees volunteer at Foundation events, participate in fundraising campaigns—builds team morale)
- **Matching gifts** (company matches employee donations 1:1 or 2:1—doubles impact)
- **Cause marketing** ("$1 from every product sold donated to Mark Egly Foundation"—company gets PR, Foundation gets funding + awareness)

**Typical Partners**: Regional businesses (restaurants, retailers—"10% of sales Tuesday benefit Mark Egly Foundation"), corporations with employee giving programs (Google, Microsoft, local banks)

**Conflict Risk**: 🟢 LOW (no healthcare conflicts, mostly goodwill + visibility)

---

## Partnership Identification & Due Diligence

### How to Find Corporate Partners

**Inbound** (Companies Approach Foundation):
- **Conference interactions**: Pharma reps at American Thoracic Society conference meet Foundation staff, propose partnership
- **Website inquiries**: "Partner with Us" page generates 5-10 inquiries/year
- **Board connections**: Board member works at pharma company, facilitates introduction

**Outbound** (Foundation Approaches Companies):
- **Strategic targeting**: Foundation identifies companies with AATD products (augmentation therapy manufacturers—3 major players), cold email: "We'd like to discuss partnership opportunities benefiting AATD patients"
- **RFPs**: Foundation issues Request for Proposals ("Seeking pharmaceutical partner for patient education grant—submit proposals by [date]")
- **Broker relationships**: Consultant who specializes in nonprofit-pharma partnerships introduces Foundation to potential funders ($5K-$10K fee if partnership closes—contingency basis)

---

### Due Diligence Checklist

**Before partnering, Foundation investigates**:

**Company Reputation**:
- ✅ **Google search**: Any recent scandals? (FDA warning letters, lawsuits, fraud investigations—red flags)
- ✅ **Patient community sentiment**: Do AATD patients trust this company? (Facebook group poll: "Would you trust Foundation's partnership with Company X?"—if 60%+ say no, reconsider)
- ✅ **Nonprofit partnerships**: Does company have track record partnering with patient organizations? (if yes, contact those orgs—"How was your experience?")

**Financial Stability**:
- ✅ **Public company**: Review 10-K (annual report—is company profitable, or burning cash and might disappear?)
- ✅ **Private company**: Request financial statements (if asking Foundation to co-develop product, need assurance company won't fold mid-project)

**Values Alignment**:
- ✅ **Mission fit**: Does company's work align with Foundation's mission? (augmentation therapy = yes, tobacco = no)
- ✅ **ESG record**: Does company have environmental/social/governance issues? (pollution, labor violations, discriminatory practices—conflicts with Foundation values)

**Legal Compliance**:
- ✅ **Debarment check**: Is company barred from federal contracts? (search SAM.gov—if debarred, risky partner)
- ✅ **OIG exclusion list**: Is company/executives excluded from Medicare/Medicaid? (healthcare fraud—avoid)

**Decision Matrix**:

| **Company**   | **Reputation** | **Patient Sentiment** | **Financial Stability** | **Mission Fit** | **Risk Level** | **Decision** |
| ------------- | -------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Company A     | ✅ Excellent   | ✅ 85% positive       | ✅ Profitable           | ✅ High         | 🟢 Low         | **Proceed**  |
| Company B     | ⚠️ Mixed       | ⚠️ 60% neutral        | ✅ Stable               | ✅ Moderate     | 🟡 Moderate    | **Proceed with caution** |
| Company C     | 🚩 Scandal (2023) | ❌ 70% negative    | ⚠️ Unprofitable         | ⚠️ Weak         | 🔴 High        | **Decline**  |

## Pharmaceutical Company Partnerships

### Unrestricted Educational Grants

**What is Unrestricted Grant?**
- Pharma company gives Foundation $100K to fund patient education (webinars, fact sheets, support groups)
- **"Unrestricted" = Foundation controls content** (company can't review/edit materials, can't require drug promotion)
- **Company benefits**: Brand visibility (logo on event materials, "Supported by Company X"), association with patient education (CSR/ESG credits)

---

### Grant Agreement Template

**EDUCATIONAL GRANT AGREEMENT**

**Between**: [Pharmaceutical Company] ("Grantor") and Mark Egly Foundation ("Grantee")

---

**1. GRANT PURPOSE**

Grantor provides unrestricted educational grant to support Grantee's AATD patient education initiatives, including:
- Monthly webinars (AATD disease management, treatment options, self-advocacy)
- Printed educational materials (symptom guides, genetic testing brochures)
- Support group facilitator training
- Annual AATD patient summit

**Total Grant**: $150,000 (one-time or annual—specify)

---

**2. GRANT CONDITIONS**

**Unrestricted**:
- Grant is unrestricted—Grantee has sole discretion over educational content, speakers, topics
- Grantor may not review or approve materials prior to publication/dissemination
- Grantee will not promote Grantor's products exclusively (may mention as treatment option among others—balanced, evidence-based)

**Acknowledgment**:
- Grantee will acknowledge Grantor's support: "This program supported by educational grant from [Company]"
- Logo placement: Company logo on event materials, website (sized comparable to other sponsors—not disproportionately large)

**No Endorsement**:
- Acknowledgment ≠ endorsement (Foundation does not endorse Grantor's products, does not state "preferred" or "recommended")
- If Grantor claims endorsement, Foundation may terminate grant, require corrective statement

---

**3. REPORTING**

**Annual Report** (Within 90 Days of Grant Period End):
- Summary of activities funded (12 webinars, 500 attendees total; 10,000 brochures distributed)
- Patient impact metrics (survey data: 85% reported increased disease knowledge)
- Financial accounting (budget vs. actual—$145K spent of $150K, $5K returned or rolled to next year)

---

**4. TERM & TERMINATION**

**Term**: January 1, 2026 - December 31, 2026 (renewable annually by mutual agreement)

**Termination**:
- **By Grantee**: If Grantor attempts to control content, requires product endorsement—Foundation may terminate with 30 days notice, retain pro-rata funds for work completed
- **By Grantor**: With 90 days notice (e.g., budget cuts)—Foundation retains funds for activities already committed

---

**5. INDEPENDENCE**

Grantee retains full editorial and programmatic independence. This grant does not create employment, agency, or partnership relationship.

---

**6. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE**

Both parties will publicly disclose partnership:
- **Foundation**: Lists Grantor on website "Corporate Partners" page, annual report donor list
- **Grantor**: May reference grant in CSR reports, press releases (must share drafts with Foundation for accuracy check)

---

**7. SIGNATURES**

[ED and Company authorized signatory]

---

### Patient Assistance Programs (PAP)

**Model**: Pharma company provides free/discounted AATD medications to uninsured/underinsured patients—Foundation serves as referral source (identifies eligible patients, helps them apply).

**Foundation's Role**:
- ✅ Patient Navigator screens patients ("Are you insured? Annual income? Drug cost burden?")
- ✅ Foundation refers eligible patients to company's PAP (provides application link, may help complete paperwork)
- ✅ Foundation tracks outcomes (how many patients approved, denied—if denial rate high, advocate for program improvements)

**Foundation Does NOT**:
- ❌ Receive payment from company for referrals (that's illegal kickback)
- ❌ Exclusively refer to one company's PAP (if multiple AATD drugs available, Foundation provides info on all—patient chooses)

**Contract Key Terms**:
> **Patient Assistance Program Collaboration Agreement**
>
> **Objective**: Improve AATD medication access for uninsured patients.
>
> **Company Responsibilities**:
> - Operate PAP (review applications, approve eligible patients, ship medications directly to patients or pharmacies)
> - Provide Foundation with program brochures, eligibility criteria, application forms
> - Process applications within 10 business days
>
> **Foundation Responsibilities**:
> - Inform patients about PAP (include in patient resource packets, website, navigator calls)
> - Assist patients with application completion (if requested)
> - Collect aggregate data (# referred, # approved—for program evaluation)
>
> **No Fees**: Foundation does not charge patients or receive compensation from Company for referrals.
>
> **Non-Exclusivity**: Foundation may refer patients to other manufacturers' PAPs (if multiple AATD drugs available, provide all options).

---

### Research Funding

**Model**: Pharma company funds Foundation-managed research (patient registry, real-world evidence study, quality-of-life research).

**Example**: Company grants $300K over 3 years to support AATD Patient Registry—Foundation collects patient data (demographics, genotypes, treatments, outcomes), researchers (academic partners) analyze, publish findings.

**Why Company Funds This**:
- **Real-world evidence**: FDA increasingly wants RWE (how drugs perform outside clinical trials)—registry data supplements clinical trial data
- **Post-market surveillance**: Track long-term safety, efficacy (augmentation therapy patients: what % have stable lung function at 5 years?)
- **Competitive intelligence**: Understand patient population (how many use competitor's drug, combination therapies)

**Foundation's Protections**:
- ✅ **Data ownership**: Foundation owns registry data (company gets access to aggregated, de-identified data—not patient-level identifiable data)
- ✅ **Publication rights**: Foundation + academic researchers publish findings (company cannot block publication of unfavorable results—e.g., "Drug X users have same outcomes as Drug Y"—company might dislike, but can't censor)
- ✅ **Multi-sponsor model**: Registry funded by multiple pharma companies (2-3 AATD drug manufacturers contribute proportionally)—prevents single-company control, ensures balanced analysis

---

## Healthcare Corporation Partnerships

### Genetic Testing Partnerships

**Model**: Foundation promotes AATD genetic testing (diagnosis rates abysmal—95% undiagnosed), lab offers discounted testing to Foundation referrals.

**Example**:
- **Lab**: University of Florida Alpha-1 Foundation Testing Lab (free AATD genetic testing—funded by private donors)
- **Foundation's Role**: Promote testing via social media, support groups, physician outreach ("Suspect AATD? Get free test: [link]")
- **Lab's Benefit**: Patient volume (process 5,000 tests/year instead of 2,000—scale justifies continued funding)

**Contract Terms**:
> **Genetic Testing Collaboration Agreement**
>
> **Lab Responsibilities**:
> - Provide AATD genetic testing (genotype: PI*ZZ, PI*SZ, PI*MZ, etc.) at no cost to patients referred by Foundation
> - Mail test kits to patients (cheek swab, return prepaid envelope)
> - Return results within 4 weeks
> - Provide Foundation with aggregate data (# tests processed, genotype distribution—for advocacy reports)
>
> **Foundation Responsibilities**:
> - Promote testing program (website, social media, support group announcements)
> - Refer 500-1,000 patients/year
> - Educate patients about importance of genetic testing
>
> **Data Sharing**: Lab provides Foundation quarterly reports (aggregate data—# tests, genotypes, states—no patient identifiable info without HIPAA authorization).
>
> **Patient Privacy**: Lab will not share patient contact info with Foundation (unless patient opts in to Foundation registry during test sign-up).

---

### Diagnostic Device Donations

**Model**: Medical device company donates equipment (spirometers, pulse oximeters) to Foundation for patient education events.

**Example**: Spirometer company donates 10 handheld spirometers ($500 each, $5K total)—Foundation uses at patient summits (patients learn how to measure lung function, practice with devices).

**In-Kind Donation Agreement**:
> **IN-KIND DONATION AGREEMENT**
>
> **Donor**: [Device Company]
> **Recipient**: Mark Egly Foundation
>
> **Donated Items**:
> - 10 handheld spirometers (Model XYZ, retail value $500 each)
> - Total value: $5,000
>
> **Use**: Foundation will use devices for patient education at:
> - Annual AATD Patient Summit (demonstrations, hands-on practice)
> - Regional support group meetings (loan devices to groups)
>
> **Acknowledgment**: Foundation will acknowledge Donor at events ("Spirometers provided by [Company]"), logo on event signage.
>
> **No Endorsement**: Acknowledgment ≠ endorsement (Foundation does not state device is "best" or "preferred"—one option among many).
>
> **Tax Receipt**: Foundation provides 501(c)(3) tax receipt (Donor can deduct $5K as charitable contribution).

---

## Sponsorship Agreements

### Event Sponsorship Tiers

**Model**: Foundation hosts annual AATD Patient Summit (200 attendees, $50K budget)—companies sponsor at tiered levels (Bronze $5K, Silver $10K, Gold $25K, Platinum $50K).

**Sponsor Benefits by Tier**:

| **Tier**        | **$ Amount** | **Benefits**                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Platinum**    | $50K         | Logo on all materials, 10-min speaking slot, exhibit booth, 4 summit tickets, logo on website (large), social media thank-you post, acknowledged in opening remarks |
| **Gold**        | $25K         | Logo on event materials, exhibit booth, 2 summit tickets, logo on website (medium), social media mention       |
| **Silver**      | $10K         | Logo on event program, 1 summit ticket, logo on website (small)                                                |
| **Bronze**      | $5K          | Logo on event program, name listed on website                                                                   |

- If Sponsor wants to present, submit proposal (reviewed by Program Committee—approved based on educational value, not sponsorship level)

---

**3. SPONSOR RESPONSIBILITIES**

**Payment**:
- $25,000 due by August 1, 2026 (60 days pre-event—Foundation needs funds to finalize venue, catering contracts)
- Payment methods: Check, wire transfer, ACH

---

**5. LIMITATIONS**

**No Endorsement**:
- Sponsorship ≠ endorsement (Foundation does not endorse Sponsor's products/services)

- Foundation will treat all sponsors equitably (same-tier sponsors get same-sized logos, same benefits)

**Editorial Independence**:
- Foundation retains control over event agenda, speakers, content (Sponsor may not dictate topics, demand competitor exclusion, require product promotion)

---

## Brand Guidelines & Co-Branding

### Foundation Logo Usage by Partners

**Scenario**: Pharma company sponsors Foundation event, wants to use Foundation logo in their marketing ("We're proud to support Mark Egly Foundation").

**Foundation's Policy**: Allowed with restrictions (prevent misuse, protect brand).

---

### Logo Usage Guidelines

**✅ ALLOWED**:
- "We support Mark Egly Foundation" (with Foundation logo next to statement—accurate, factual)
- CSR reports ("2026 charitable partners: Mark Egly Foundation, [others]"—logo in list)
- Event marketing ("Join us at Mark Egly Foundation Summit"—if company has booth, accurate to use logo)

**❌ PROHIBITED**:
- "Official partner of Mark Egly Foundation" (implies exclusivity, endorsement—misleading)
- "Recommended by Mark Egly Foundation" (endorsement—Foundation doesn't endorse products/services unless explicitly stated)
- "Mark Egly Foundation-certified [product]" (certification program doesn't exist—false claim)
- Altered logos (changing colors, stretching, adding text—brand integrity)

---

### Logo Usage Agreement (Addendum to Partnership Contract)

> **LOGO USAGE TERMS**
>
> **Grant of License**: Foundation grants Partner limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use Foundation name and logo solely for purposes of:
> - Acknowledging partnership (CSR reports, press releases, website)
> - Promoting joint events (if applicable)
>
> **Restrictions**:
> - Partner may not imply endorsement, exclusivity, or certification unless Foundation provides written authorization
> - Partner must submit proposed uses to Foundation for pre-approval (email draft to [Communications Manager]—5 business days for review)
> - Partner must use logo per Brand Guidelines (Appendix A—correct colors, spacing, size)
>
> **Consequences of Misuse**:
> - First violation: Foundation requests correction (Partner has 10 days to comply)
> - Second violation: Foundation revokes logo usage rights (Partner must cease all use)
> - Continued misuse: Foundation may terminate partnership, pursue legal remedies (trademark infringement, false advertising)

---

## Conflicts of Interest Management

### Foundation's Conflict of Interest Policy

**Scenario**: Board member works for pharma company—company proposes $200K grant to Foundation.

**Conflict**: Board member has dual loyalty (Foundation vs. employer)—may push Board to accept grant that benefits employer (even if not best deal for Foundation), or insider info leaks to employer.

---

### Conflict Management Protocol

**Step 1: Disclosure**:
- Board member discloses conflict at Board meeting ("I work for Company X, they're proposing grant—I have conflict")
- Disclosure documented in meeting minutes

**Step 2: Recusal**:
- Board member leaves room during discussion + vote (may not participate, influence decision)
- Other Board members debate grant merits without conflicted member present

**Step 3: Decision**:
- Remaining Board votes (majority required to approve)
- If approved, minutes note conflict was disclosed, member recused

**Step 4: Ongoing Management**:
- Conflicted Board member may not be involved in grant administration (e.g., reviewing reports, communicating with company about grant)
- ED manages relationship with company (not Board member)

---

### Staff Conflicts

**Scenario**: ED's spouse works for pharma company—company proposes partnership.

**Management**:
- ED discloses to Board Chair (before negotiations)
- Board Chair appoints separate staff member (Development Director) to negotiate (ED recused)
- Board approves final contract (ED may provide input, but Board makes decision)

**Alternative** (If Conflict Severe):
- Decline partnership (e.g., ED's spouse is company's CEO—too much appearance of impropriety, even if handled ethically)

---

## Foundation Independence Protections

### Why Independence Matters

**Risk**: Heavy reliance on corporate funding → perception Foundation is "bought" → patients distrust recommendations ("Of course Foundation says Drug X is great—they're funded by Company X").

**Mitigation**: Diversify funding, maintain editorial control, disclose transparently.

---

### Independence Safeguards

**1. Funding Diversification**:
- **Target**: No single corporate funder >20% of total revenue (if Company X provides $200K, total budget should be $1M+—ensures Foundation not dependent on one company)
- **Multiple pharma sponsors**: Partner with 2-3 AATD drug manufacturers (if only one, perception of favoritism—multiple = balanced)

**2. Editorial Control**:
- **Unrestricted grants only**: Foundation does not accept "restricted" grants where company dictates content (e.g., "Grant funds webinar, but webinar must cover our drug"—no)
- **Content approval**: Foundation never allows corporate funders to pre-approve educational materials (undermines credibility)

**3. Transparent Disclosure**:
- **Website**: "Corporate Partners" page lists all funders ($10K+), updated quarterly
- **Annual report**: Revenue pie chart (individual donors 40%, corporate 25%, foundations 20%, government 10%, events 5%—transparency)
- **Sponsored content labeled**: "This program supported by educational grant from [Company]"—audience knows funding source

**4. Patient Advisory Committee**:
- **Consult patients before major corporate partnerships** ("We're considering $300K grant from Company Y—thoughts?")—if patients object, reconsider
- **Annual survey**: "Do you trust Foundation's independence?" (if <80% say yes, investigate—is corporate funding eroding trust?)

**5. Decline Certain Partnerships**:
- **Absolute no**: Tobacco companies, companies with egregious ethical violations (fraud convictions, patient harm scandals)
- **Case-by-case**: Companies with controversial reputations (opioid manufacturers—AATD Foundation might decline due to opioid crisis, even if company donates to other health causes)

---

## Termination & Exit Clauses

### When to End Corporate Partnership

**Mutual Agreement** (Partnership Runs Course):
- Grant period ends (1-year grant, not renewed—company's priorities shift, Foundation's needs change)
- Both parties satisfied, but no longer strategic fit

**Foundation-Initiated Termination**:
- **Company misconduct**: Scandal (fraud, patient harm), DOJ investigation, bankruptcy—Foundation doesn't want association
- **Breach of contract**: Company misrepresents relationship as endorsement (after warnings), attempts to control content
- **Mission drift**: Company pivots away from AATD (sells AATD drug division), partnership no longer relevant

**Company-Initiated Termination**:
- **Budget cuts**: Company restructures, eliminates philanthropic program
- **Strategic shift**: Company focuses CSR on different disease areas (exits rare disease space)

---

### Termination Clause Template

> **TERMINATION**
>
> **Term**: This Agreement effective January 1, 2026 - December 31, 2026.
>
> **Renewal**: Parties may renew annually by mutual written agreement (90 days before expiration).
>
> **Termination for Cause**:
> - Either party may terminate immediately if other party materially breaches (written notice, describe breach)
> - Breaching party has 30 days to cure (if curable)
> - If not cured, termination effective
>
> **Termination for Convenience**:
> - Either party may terminate without cause (90 days written notice)
>
> **Effect of Termination**:
> - **Grants**: If Foundation terminates Company's grant, Foundation returns unused funds (pro-rata) within 60 days
> - **Sponsorships**: If Foundation terminates before event, Foundation refunds sponsorship fee (minus costs already incurred—e.g., if logo already printed on 500 programs, Foundation deducts printing cost)
> - **Logo usage**: Upon termination, Company must cease using Foundation logo within 30 days (remove from website, marketing materials)
> - **Acknowledgments**: Company may reference past partnership factually ("In 2026, we supported Mark Egly Foundation"—accurate historical statement, not ongoing endorsement)

---

## Legal & Tax Considerations

### IRS Rules for Corporate Sponsorships

**Tax Law**: Corporations can deduct charitable contributions (sponsorships, grants) IF:
- ✅ **Qualified 501(c)(3)**: Foundation is IRS-recognized charity (deduction-eligible)
- ✅ **Acknowledgment, not advertising**: Foundation acknowledges sponsor (logos, thank-yous—okay), but if Foundation advertises sponsor's products ("Buy Drug X!"—not okay, becomes taxable "unrelated business income" for Foundation)

---

### Qualified Sponsorship Payment (QSP) vs. Advertising

**IRS Definition**:

**Qualified Sponsorship Payment** (Tax-Free to Foundation):
- ✅ "This event supported by Company X" (neutral acknowledgment)
- ✅ Company logo, name, location, phone, website (identifying info—okay)
- ✅ "Company X manufactures AATD treatments" (factual description of business—okay)

**Advertising** (Taxable to Foundation):
- ❌ "Buy Drug X from Company X—best AATD treatment!" (endorsement, call-to-action—advertising, Foundation owes Unrelated Business Income Tax on sponsorship $)
- ❌ Comparative claims ("Company X's drug is superior to competitors"—advertising)

**Foundation's Policy**: Keep sponsorships as QSPs (neutral acknowledgments, no advertising—avoids tax complications).

---
