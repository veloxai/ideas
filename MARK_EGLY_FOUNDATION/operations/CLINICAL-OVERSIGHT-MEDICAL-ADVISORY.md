## Clinical Oversight Philosophy

### Foundation's Clinical Role

**What Foundation IS:**

- Research funder and facilitator
- Patient registry operator
- Medical information provider (educational, not advisory)
- Convener of researchers, clinicians, and patients
- Advocate for evidence-based Alpha-1 care policies

**What Foundation IS NOT:**

- Healthcare provider (does not diagnose, treat, or prescribe)
- Clinical decision-maker for individual patients
- Substitute for physician-patient relationship
- Liable for clinical outcomes of providers we refer to

**Clear Boundaries**: All Foundation materials prominently disclaim: _"This information is for educational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. Always consult your physician for medical decisions."_

### Why Clinical Oversight Matters

Despite not providing clinical care, Foundation requires clinical oversight because:

1. **Research Funding**: Foundation-funded research involves human subjects; Medical Director ensures protocols are scientifically sound and ethically appropriate

2. **Registry Data**: Registry collects clinical data (diagnoses, test results, symptoms); Medical Director ensures data collection is medically meaningful and interpreted correctly

3. **Educational Content**: Website, publications, webinars provide health information; Medical Director ensures accuracy and appropriateness

4. **Provider Referrals**: Foundation connects patients to specialists; Medical Director advises on provider network quality standards

5. **Clinical Trial Facilitation**: Foundation may facilitate patient recruitment for trials; Medical Director ensures trials meet safety and ethical standards

6. **Genetic Testing Guidance**: Foundation educates about genetic testing; Genetic Counselor ensures guidance is medically and ethically appropriate

### Scope of Clinical Oversight

**Activities Requiring Medical Director Review:**

- Research grant applications (scientific merit, human subjects protection)
- Registry consent forms and data collection instruments
- Educational materials with clinical content (fact sheets, webinars, videos)
- Clinical trial protocols Foundation facilitates
- Provider referral criteria
- Adverse event reports with clinical implications
- Genetic testing education materials

**Activities Requiring Medical Advisory Board Input:**

- Research funding priorities (which research areas to emphasize)
- Clinical guidelines adoption (when to update Foundation recommendations based on new evidence)
- Strategic initiatives with clinical implications (e.g., launching newborn screening advocacy campaign)

## Research Protocol Review

### Grant Application Review Process

**Foundation funds $100K-$500K in research grants annually.** Medical Director plays key role in evaluating scientific merit.

**Grant Review Timeline:**

1. **Application Submission** (due dates: March 1, September 1 for two annual cycles)
2. **Administrative Review** (Research Program Manager ensures applications complete)
3. **Medical Director Preliminary Review** (2 weeks): Medical Director reviews all applications; triages into categories:
   - **High Priority**: Strong scientific merit; recommend full review
   - **Medium Priority**: Interesting but concerns about feasibility/impact; recommend full review with questions
   - **Low Priority**: Weak scientific rationale or outside Foundation priorities; recommend rejection
4. **Medical Advisory Board Review** (4 weeks): High and Medium priority applications reviewed by full Medical Advisory Board; members score applications
5. **Review Panel Meeting** (virtual, 3 hours): Medical Director, Medical Advisory Board members (available), Research Program Manager, ED discuss applications; make funding recommendations
6. **Board Approval** (following month): ED presents funding recommendations to Board; Board approves final funding decisions

**Medical Director Review Criteria:**

| **Criterion**                   | **Weight** | **Key Questions**                                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scientific Merit**            | 30%        | Is hypothesis sound? Are methods appropriate? Is study design rigorous?                     |
| **Significance**                | 25%        | Will this research advance Alpha-1 field? Potential for patient impact?                     |
| **Investigator Qualifications** | 20%        | Does PI have expertise and track record? Is team qualified?                                 |
| **Feasibility**                 | 15%        | Can study be completed with proposed timeline and budget? Access to participants/resources? |
| **Human Subjects Protection**   | 10%        | Are ethical issues addressed? Will IRB approval be obtained? Is informed consent adequate?  |

**Score Range**: 1-5 (1=poor, 3=good, 5=excellent) for each criterion; weighted composite score determines funding recommendations.

### Protocol Monitoring

**After grant awarded, Medical Director monitors progress:**

- **Annual Progress Reports**: PI submits annual report; Medical Director reviews; flags concerns (slow enrollment, protocol deviations, safety issues)
- **Site Visits** (if feasible): Medical Director may visit research sites to observe studies
- **Publication Review**: Medical Director reviews manuscripts acknowledging Foundation funding before submission (ensures scientific accuracy, appropriate Foundation acknowledgment)

---

## Clinical Trial Safety Monitoring

### Foundation's Role in Clinical Trials

**Foundation does not conduct clinical trials** but may:

1. **Facilitate Recruitment**: Help researchers recruit Alpha-1 patients for trials
2. **Provide Registry Data**: Share de-identified registry data with trial investigators (per Data Use Agreement)
3. **Fund Pilot Studies**: Fund early-phase research that leads to trials

**When Foundation involved, Medical Director ensures patient safety.**

### Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)

**For Foundation-funded Phase II or III clinical trials** (rare but possible if Foundation grows):

**DSMB Composition**: 3-5 independent experts (not involved in trial) including:

- Clinician expert in disease
- Biostatistician
- Ethicist or patient advocate

**DSMB Responsibilities:**

- Review interim trial data (safety, efficacy)
- Recommend trial continuation, modification, or termination based on benefit-risk assessment
- Ensure participant safety

**Medical Director Role**: May serve on DSMB or help convene DSMB; ensures DSMB has adequate authority and independence.

### Adverse Event Reporting in Research

**Researchers funded by Foundation must report serious adverse events (SAEs):**

**SAE Definition**: Death, life-threatening event, hospitalization, disability, congenital anomaly, or other serious medical event.

**Reporting Timeline**:

- **Serious Unexpected Related**: 24 hours to IRB and Foundation Medical Director
- **Serious Expected or Unrelated**: 10 days to IRB; summary to Foundation in annual report

**Medical Director Action**:

- Reviews SAE reports
- Assesses whether SAE related to research procedures
- Determines if protocol modification needed
- Consults with PI and IRB
- Recommends suspension of research if patient safety concern

---

## IRB Liaison and Coordination

### Foundation Activities Requiring IRB Review

**Potentially IRB-Required:**

1. **Patient Registry**: If registry data will be published as generalizable research (not just quality improvement)
2. **Foundation-Funded Research**: All human subjects research requires IRB approval (typically investigator's institution IRB)
3. **Survey Research**: If Foundation surveys patients for research purposes (not just program evaluation)

**Year 1-2 Approach**: Operate under quality improvement exemption (registry, surveys for program improvement only, not published research)

**Year 3+ Approach**: As research ambitions grow, obtain IRB approval for registry and research activities

### Selecting an IRB

**Options:**

1. **Partner Institution IRB**: If Medical Director or Foundation partner has academic appointment, use their institution's IRB (may require Foundation to become affiliate or sub-awardee)

2. **Independent/Commercial IRB**: Contract with independent IRB (e.g., WCG IRB, Advarra, Sterling IRB)
   - Cost: $3,000-$8,000/year for registry protocol plus amendments and continuing review
   - Benefit: Faster reviews than academic IRBs; accustomed to nonprofit research

3. **Consortium IRB**: Join rare disease research consortium with shared IRB

**Medical Director Recommendation**: ED evaluates options; Medical Director advises on IRB quality and appropriateness.

### IRB Submission and Management

**Medical Director Role:**

- **Protocol Development**: Works with Registry Manager to develop IRB protocol application
- **Submission**: Signs protocol as Principal Investigator (if Foundation-based) or Co-Investigator (if under academic institution)
- **Continuing Review**: Completes annual IRB renewal applications
- **Amendment Submissions**: Submits protocol amendments when registry procedures change
- **IRB Correspondence**: Responds to IRB questions, requests for modifications

**Timeline**: Initial IRB approval takes 1-3 months (expedited review if minimal risk); continuing review annually.

---

## Patient Registry Clinical Oversight

### Clinical Data Quality

**Medical Director ensures registry collects medically meaningful, accurate data:**

**Key Clinical Data Elements** (Medical Director advises on inclusion):

- **Diagnosis**: Alpha-1 genotype, age at diagnosis, how diagnosed (screening, symptomatic)
- **Pulmonary Manifestations**: COPD diagnosis, emphysema, asthma, bronchiectasis; FEV1 (lung function); exacerbations
- **Hepatic Manifestations**: Liver disease type (cirrhosis, fibrosis), liver function tests, liver-related complications
- **Treatment**: Augmentation therapy (Alpha-1 protein replacement), lung transplant, liver transplant, other medications
- **Comorbidities**: Other significant health conditions
- **Family History**: Alpha-1 in family members; testing of relatives

**Data Collection Standards**:

- **Standardized Definitions**: Use consistent definitions (e.g., "COPD" defined per GOLD criteria)
- **Validated Instruments**: Use validated questionnaires when available (e.g., COPD Assessment Test, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire)
- **Clinician-Reported vs. Patient-Reported**: Distinguish between data from medical records (clinician-reported) and patient surveys (patient-reported); both valuable but different reliability

### Registry Data Analysis and Interpretation

**When Foundation publishes registry findings** (annual report, conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications):

**Medical Director reviews analyses and interpretations:**

- **Statistical Appropriateness**: Are analyses statistically sound? (May consult biostatistician if Foundation lacks in-house expertise)
- **Clinical Interpretation**: Are findings interpreted correctly? Are alternative explanations considered?
- **Limitations**: Are data limitations acknowledged (e.g., selection bias, self-reported data)?
- **Recommendations**: Are clinical recommendations appropriate or overstated?

**Example**: Registry data shows 60% of participants diagnosed after age 40.

- **Appropriate Interpretation**: "The majority of registry participants were diagnosed in mid-life, highlighting the need for increased awareness among middle-aged adults with respiratory symptoms."
- **Inappropriate Interpretation**: "Alpha-1 is primarily a disease of middle age." (Wrong: Early diagnosis may be missed; registry may not capture pediatric cases)

**Medical Director ensures interpretation is appropriate.**

---

## Medical Ethics Consultations

### Common Ethics Dilemmas

**Foundation encounters medical ethics questions** requiring Medical Director guidance:

**1. Genetic Testing in Children**

**Dilemma**: Should Foundation encourage parents to test asymptomatic children for Alpha-1?

**Considerations**:

- **Pro Testing**: Early knowledge allows monitoring; lifestyle modifications (avoid smoking)
- **Con Testing**: Child may face discrimination (insurance, employment); psychological burden; autonomy (child cannot consent)

**Guidance**: Medical Director advises on current professional society guidelines (typically: delay testing until child is old enough to participate in decision, unless family planning or medical management would change)

**2. Cascade Testing (Family Member Screening)**

**Dilemma**: Should Foundation encourage patients to ask relatives to get tested?

**Considerations**:

- **Pro Cascade Testing**: Identifies at-risk relatives before symptoms; prevents disease progression
- **Con**: Pressure on patients to disclose diagnosis to family; relatives may not want to know; genetic discrimination concerns

**Guidance**: Medical Director advises on culturally sensitive, non-coercive cascade testing strategies; Foundation provides resources but doesn't pressure patients

**3. Research Enrollment of Severely Ill Patients**

**Dilemma**: Patient with advanced liver disease wants to enroll in observational study but is very ill; concerned about burden.

**Considerations**:

- **Respect for Autonomy**: If patient wants to participate, who are we to say no?
- **Beneficence**: Is participation truly in patient's best interest or causing undue burden?
- **Justice**: Excluding very sick patients means research findings may not apply to them

**Guidance**: Medical Director ensures informed consent process robustly addresses burden; explores accommodations (phone surveys instead of in-person; proxy completion); ultimately respects patient choice if capacity intact

**4. Incidental Findings**

**Dilemma**: Registry participant's submitted medical records reveal abnormal test result patient may not know about.

**Considerations**:

- **Duty to Warn**: Do we have obligation to tell patient?
- **Scope of Relationship**: We are research registry, not healthcare provider; is this our role?
- **Accuracy**: Are we certain finding is accurate and unknown to patient?

**Guidance**: Medical Director advises on Foundation policy (typically: If finding is serious, actionable, and clearly unknown to patient, contact patient's physician; if no physician listed, contact patient and urge them to see physician; document thoroughly)

### Ethics Consultation Process

**When ethics dilemma arises:**

1. **Identify Issue**: Staff or patient raises ethical concern
2. **Consult Medical Director**: ED or COO contacts Medical Director; provides case details
3. **Medical Director Analysis**: Medical Director researches issue (reviews ethics literature, guidelines), consults colleagues if needed
4. **Recommendation**: Medical Director provides written recommendation with rationale
5. **Decision**: ED/Board decides course of action considering Medical Director's guidance
6. **Documentation**: Decision and rationale documented; added to ethics case library for future reference

---

## Provider Network Development

### Purpose of Provider Network

**Foundation maintains directory of Alpha-1 specialists** to help patients find expert care.

**Benefits**:

- Patients have access to qualified providers
- Providers treating Alpha-1 patients have resource for referrals
- Foundation can convene network for education, research collaboration

### Provider Inclusion Criteria

**Medical Director establishes criteria for directory inclusion:**

**Minimum Qualifications**:

- Board certification in relevant specialty (Pulmonology, Hepatology, Gastroenterology, Genetics)
- Active medical license in good standing
- Treats Alpha-1 patients (minimum 10-20 patients in practice)
- Willingness to accept new Alpha-1 patients
- Agreement to Foundation's referral terms (no fees to Foundation for referrals; commitment to evidence-based care)

**Preferred Qualifications**:

- Subspecialty expertise (e.g., Advanced Lung Disease, Transplant Hepatology)
- Experience with augmentation therapy
- Participation in Alpha-1 research or registries
- Access to Alpha-1 genetic testing and counseling
- Multidisciplinary team (genetic counselor, respiratory therapist, transplant team)

**Geographic Distribution**: Aim for coverage in all major U.S. metropolitan areas; identify rural areas with limited access

### Provider Vetting Process

1. **Application**: Provider completes application (CV, licensure, patient volume, services offered)
2. **Medical Director Review**: Reviews qualifications; may contact provider for discussion
3. **Reference Check**: Contact 1-2 professional references (colleagues, patients if available)
4. **Approval**: Medical Director approves provider for directory; notifies ED
5. **Listing**: Provider added to online directory with profile (location, contact, specialties, services)

**Annual Re-Verification**: Providers confirm annually that information is current and licensure is active.

### Quality Assurance

**Monitoring Provider Quality**:

- **Patient Feedback**: Patients can submit feedback on referred providers (satisfaction, concerns)
- **Complaint Investigation**: If patient complains about provider (poor care, inappropriate behavior), Medical Director investigates
- **Removal**: Medical Director may remove provider from directory for quality/safety concerns, license discipline, or patient complaints

**Example**: Patient complains provider dismissed symptoms, refused augmentation therapy without explanation.

- Medical Director contacts provider for response
- Reviews medical records (with patient permission)
- Assesses whether care met standards
- If substandard: Works with provider to address issues or removes from directory
- If standards met but communication issue: Coaches provider on patient communication

## Clinical Content Review

### Content Requiring Medical Director Approval

**Before publication, Medical Director reviews:**

1. **Website Health Information Pages**: Disease overview, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment options
2. **Fact Sheets/Brochures**: Printed materials about Alpha-1
3. **Webinars with Clinical Content**: Educational webinars for patients or providers
4. **Video Scripts**: Videos about Alpha-1 health topics
5. **Social Media Posts with Medical Claims**: Posts stating medical facts (not just awareness messages)
6. **Grant Reports/Publications**: Lay summaries of research findings
7. **Advocacy Materials**: Policy briefs citing clinical evidence

**Content NOT Requiring Medical Director Review** (but reviewed by program staff):

- Event logistics information
- Fundraising appeals without medical content
- General awareness messages ("Get tested for Alpha-1")
- Patient stories (reviewed to ensure no inappropriate medical advice, but patient's own words generally not edited)

### Review Process and Turnaround Time

**Process:**

1. **Content Developer** (Communications Manager, Program Manager) drafts content
2. **Submit for Review**: Sends to Medical Director with context (where will be published, target audience, purpose)
3. **Medical Director Review** (within 5 business days for routine content; 2 business days for time-sensitive):
   - Checks medical accuracy (facts, statistics, treatment descriptions)
   - Ensures balanced presentation (not promoting specific treatments or providers inappropriately)
   - Verifies references (citations to peer-reviewed sources for medical claims)
   - Suggests edits for clarity or accuracy
4. **Revision**: Content developer revises per Medical Director feedback
5. **Final Approval**: Medical Director approves; content published

**Expedited Review**: For time-sensitive content (press response, conference presentation), Medical Director provides same-day or next-day review.

### Medical Accuracy Standards

**Requirements for Clinical Content:**

- **Evidence-Based**: Medical claims supported by peer-reviewed research or clinical guidelines
- **Current**: Information reflects current medical understanding (within last 5 years unless fundamental concept)
- **Balanced**: Presents benefits and risks of treatments; acknowledges uncertainty where it exists
- **Appropriate Disclaimers**: Clearly states information is educational, not medical advice
- **Plain Language**: Accessible to lay audiences while medically accurate
- **References**: Cites sources for medical facts (links to PubMed, guidelines)

**Example - Fact Sheet on Augmentation Therapy:**

**Must Include:**

- What it is (IV infusion of purified Alpha-1 protein)
- Who it's for (patients with lung disease and severe Alpha-1 deficiency)
- Evidence for efficacy (slows lung function decline per studies; cite references)
- Limitations (does not help liver disease; may not benefit all patients)
- Side effects (infusion reactions, allergic reactions)
- Access (FDA-approved; insurance coverage varies)
- Not a substitute for smoking cessation and other standard COPD care

**Must NOT Say:**

- "Augmentation therapy cures Alpha-1" (false; it slows progression)
- "All Alpha-1 patients should receive augmentation therapy" (too broad; depends on lung disease and genotype)
- Promote specific brand-name products (Prolastin, Aralast, Zemaira, Glassia) without mentioning alternatives

## Genetic Counseling Oversight

### Importance of Genetic Counseling

**Alpha-1 is genetic condition**; patients and families have questions about:

- Inheritance patterns (autosomal recessive)
- Testing of children and relatives
- Implications for family planning
- Genetic discrimination concerns

**Genetic counseling ensures patients make informed decisions** about testing and family communication.

### Genetic Counselor Advisor

**Position**: Part-time or consultant genetic counselor with Alpha-1 expertise (0.1 FTE or project-based)

**Responsibilities:**

- Review genetic testing educational materials for accuracy and appropriateness
- Develop guidance on cascade testing (family member screening)
- Advise on ethical issues related to genetic testing (testing minors, disclosure to relatives)
- Train Foundation staff on genetic counseling principles
- Provide or coordinate genetic counseling services for registry participants (if Foundation offers)

**Collaboration with Medical Director**: Genetic Counselor Advisor and Medical Director collaborate on genetic testing policies.

### Genetic Testing Education Standards

**Foundation's Genetic Testing Education Must:**

- Explain what genetic test measures (AAT genotype; identifies Pi*Z, Pi*S, and other alleles)
- Describe who should be tested (symptomatic individuals; first-degree relatives of patients; anyone with unexplained COPD or liver disease)
- Clarify what test does and doesn't reveal (identifies Alpha-1 genotype; does NOT predict disease severity or guarantee disease development)
- Discuss benefits and limitations of testing
- Address genetic discrimination (GINA protections for health insurance and employment; gaps in life/disability insurance)
- Recommend genetic counseling for complex situations (family planning, testing children)
- Provide resources for testing (where to get tested, cost, insurance coverage)

**Genetic Counselor Advisor reviews all genetic testing materials.**
