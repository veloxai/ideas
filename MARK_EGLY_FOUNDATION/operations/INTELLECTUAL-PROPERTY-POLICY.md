## Executive Summary

The Mark Egly Foundation's Intellectual Property Policy establishes clear ownership, protection, and commercialization guidelines for all intellectual assets created in pursuit of the Foundation's mission to advance Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency research, diagnosis, and patient support. This policy balances the Foundation's need to protect valuable IP assets with its commitment to open science, data sharing, and maximizing public benefit.

**Key Policy Principles:**

1. **Mission Alignment**: IP decisions prioritize patient benefit and scientific advancement over revenue generation
2. **Ownership Clarity**: Unambiguous assignment of IP rights for all stakeholders (employees, contractors, researchers, partners)
3. **Work-for-Hire Default**: Foundation owns IP created by employees within scope of employment
4. **Open Science Commitment**: Research data and publications openly shared unless commercialization potential justifies protection
5. **Strategic Patenting**: Patents pursued only when necessary to enable development, prevent blocking patents, or generate mission-supporting revenue
6. **Fair Licensing**: Technology licensed non-exclusively when possible, with patient access provisions in all commercial licenses

**IP Asset Categories:**

- **Trademarks**: Foundation name, logo, Alpha-1 awareness campaign brands
- **Copyrights**: Website content, educational materials, registry database structure, patient resources
- **Trade Secrets**: Donor algorithms, registry data analysis methods, partnership negotiation strategies
- **Patents**: Diagnostic tools, treatment innovations, biomarker discoveries (selectively pursued)
- **Data**: De-identified patient registry data (shared under Data Use Agreements)

**This Policy Applies To:**

- All Foundation employees (full-time, part-time, temporary)
- Independent contractors and consultants
- Volunteer researchers and medical advisors
- Research grant recipients (subject to specific grant agreements)
- Academic and corporate partners (subject to collaboration agreements)
- Board members contributing to IP-generating activities

---

## IP Policy Philosophy

### Mission-Driven IP Management

The Foundation's IP strategy serves three core objectives:

1. **Accelerate Research**: Remove IP barriers to Alpha-1 research through open data sharing and non-exclusive licensing
2. **Ensure Patient Access**: Prevent IP from limiting patient access to diagnostics, treatments, or care resources
3. **Sustain Operations**: Generate mission-aligned revenue from IP commercialization when appropriate

### Balancing Protection and Openness

**When We Protect IP:**

- Innovations with commercial potential requiring patent protection to attract development partners
- Branding assets (trademarks) to prevent confusion and protect reputation
- Confidential business strategies and donor data (trade secrets)
- Educational materials and creative works (copyrights) to control quality and ensure accurate attribution

**When We Share Openly:**

- Research publications (open access whenever possible)
- De-identified patient registry data (under Data Use Agreements)
- Best practices for Alpha-1 diagnosis and care coordination
- Patient education resources (Creative Commons licensing)
- Conference presentations and advocacy materials

### Strategic IP Decision-Making

**The "Three Questions" IP Framework:**

Before pursuing IP protection, answer:

1. **Mission Impact**: Does protecting this IP advance patient outcomes or research progress?
2. **Commercial Necessity**: Is IP protection required to attract development partners or prevent misuse?
3. **Resource Justification**: Do benefits of protection exceed costs (legal fees, maintenance, enforcement)?

If all three answers are "yes," pursue protection. Otherwise, default to open sharing.

## Scope and Applicability

### Covered IP Types

**Protected Under This Policy:**

1. **Inventions**: Novel diagnostic tools, treatment methods, biomarkers, research methodologies
2. **Creative Works**: Publications, educational materials, videos, website content, patient resources
3. **Software**: Registry database, data analysis tools, patient portal, mobile apps
4. **Data**: Registry data, research datasets, survey results, outcomes data
5. **Branding**: Trademarks, logos, slogans, campaign names
6. **Designs**: Educational materials layouts, infographics, patient resource formats
7. **Trade Secrets**: Donor cultivation strategies, partnership negotiation tactics, proprietary analytics

**Not Covered (Exemptions):**

- Board member volunteer contributions (unless specifically contracted for IP development)
- Individual donor information shared with Foundation (donor retains ownership)
- Pre-existing IP brought to Foundation by new employees/contractors (unless assigned by written agreement)
- Personal works created on personal time with personal resources unrelated to Foundation mission

### Geographic Scope

- **Primary Protection**: United States (where Foundation operates and majority of patients reside)
- **Strategic International**: Consider EU, Canada, Australia IP protection for high-value innovations with global research impact
- **Developing Nations**: Generally forgo IP protection to maximize access; consider humanitarian licensing

## IP Ownership Framework

### Default Ownership Rules

| **Creator Category**                 | **Default Ownership**                                                           | **Documentation Required**                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Employees** (full-time, part-time) | Foundation owns all work-related IP                                             | Employment Agreement with IP assignment clause          |
| **Independent Contractors**          | Foundation owns IP if work-for-hire agreement signed; contractor retains if not | Statement of Work with IP assignment clause             |
| **Volunteers** (Board, advisors)     | Volunteer retains ownership unless assignment agreed                            | IP Assignment Agreement (if Foundation needs ownership) |
| **Research Grant Recipients**        | Per Grant Agreement (often joint ownership)                                     | Grant Agreement with IP terms                           |
| **Academic Partners**                | Per Research Collaboration Agreement                                            | Collaboration Agreement with IP allocation terms        |
| **Corporate Partners**               | Per Partnership Agreement                                                       | Partnership/Sponsored Research Agreement                |

### IP Assignment Language

**Standard Employment Agreement IP Clause:**

> **Section 8: Intellectual Property Assignment**
>
> Employee hereby assigns to the Mark Egly Foundation all right, title, and interest in and to any and all intellectual property (including but not limited to inventions, discoveries, writings, software, data, and creative works) conceived, developed, or reduced to practice by Employee during employment and within the scope of Employee's duties or using Foundation resources. This assignment includes all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other proprietary rights worldwide.
>
> Employee agrees to execute any documents reasonably necessary to perfect Foundation's ownership rights and to cooperate in obtaining patent, copyright, or trademark protection for such intellectual property.
>
> **Excluded Inventions**: Employee has listed on Exhibit A any inventions developed prior to employment that Employee wishes to exclude from this assignment. If no inventions are listed, Employee represents that there are no such prior inventions.

**Standard Independent Contractor IP Clause:**

> **Section 5: Work Product Ownership**
>
> Contractor agrees that all work product, including but not limited to inventions, writings, software, data, and creative works, developed under this Agreement shall be deemed "work made for hire" under U.S. copyright law and shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Mark Egly Foundation. To the extent any work product does not qualify as work made for hire, Contractor hereby assigns all right, title, and interest to Foundation.

### Joint Ownership Situations

**When Joint Ownership Applies:**

- Research collaborations where both parties contribute substantially to invention
- Academic partnerships with co-investigators
- Patient-contributed innovations (e.g., patient-designed care tools)

**Joint Ownership Terms:**

- **Filing Decisions**: Both parties must agree to pursue patent protection
- **Licensing Rights**: Each party may license independently (unless agreement specifies otherwise)
- **Revenue Sharing**: Negotiated in collaboration agreement (common: 50/50 after costs, or proportional to contribution)
- **Publication Rights**: Both parties have right to publish (with reasonable pre-publication review period)

**Avoid Joint Ownership When Possible**: It complicates licensing and commercialization. Prefer sole ownership with royalty-sharing or licensing-back provisions.

---

## Work-Made-For-Hire Doctrine

### Legal Foundation

Under U.S. Copyright Act Section 101, a "work made for hire" is:

1. A work prepared by an employee within the scope of employment, OR
2. A commissioned work (by independent contractor) in one of nine specified categories, if parties expressly agree in writing

**Effect**: Employer/hiring party owns copyright from creation; no assignment required.

### Scope of Employment Test

**IP Created During Employment Is Owned by Foundation If:**

1. **Within Job Duties**: Creation relates to employee's assigned responsibilities
2. **Using Foundation Resources**: Created using Foundation equipment, facilities, data, or funding
3. **During Work Time**: Created during work hours or on Foundation premises

**Example: Ownership Scenarios**

| **Scenario**                                                                            | **Foundation Owns?** | **Rationale**                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| COO creates donor CRM workflow during work hours                                        | **YES**              | Within job duties, work time, Foundation resources        |
| Research Coordinator publishes Alpha-1 patient survey results                           | **YES**              | Job-related research, Foundation data                     |
| Employee writes personal blog about unrelated topic on weekend                          | **NO**               | Outside scope, personal time, personal topic              |
| Employee develops Alpha-1 patient app on personal time using Foundation's registry data | **YES**              | Uses Foundation confidential data (even if personal time) |
| Contractor develops website per SOW                                                     | **YES**              | Work-for-hire under contract                              |
| Board member suggests fundraising event idea at meeting                                 | **NO**               | Volunteer contribution, not contracted                    |
| Medical Advisor develops new diagnostic protocol using Foundation grant                 | **MAYBE**            | Depends on grant agreement and advisor contract           |

### Employee Moonlighting

**Policy**: Employees may engage in outside work unrelated to Foundation mission on personal time, retaining IP ownership, provided:

1. Outside work does not compete with Foundation activities
2. No Foundation resources used (data, equipment, networks, work time)
3. Outside work does not create conflict of interest
4. Employee has disclosed outside work to supervisor and received approval

**Disclosure Requirement**: Employees must annually disclose outside professional activities on Conflict of Interest form.

---

## Employee Inventions and Discoveries

### Invention Disclosure Process

**Step 1: Recognize Invention**

Employees should disclose potential inventions including:

- New diagnostic methods or tools
- Treatment innovations or protocols
- Biomarkers or genetic discoveries
- Software or algorithms
- Registry data analysis methods with commercial application
- Patient care tools or workflows

**"When in Doubt, Disclose"**: Over-disclosure is preferable to missing protectable innovation.

**Step 2: Complete Invention Disclosure Form**

Within 30 days of conception, employee submits Invention Disclosure Form including:

- Description of invention
- Problem solved
- Advantages over existing solutions
- Co-inventors (if applicable)
- Prior art known
- Public disclosures made (dates, venues)
- Research funding sources
- Commercial potential assessment

**Step 3: Executive Director Review**

ED reviews with input from:

- Medical Director (clinical inventions)
- Technology lead (software/data inventions)
- Legal counsel (patentability, freedom to operate)

**Step 4: Foundation Decision**

Foundation decides within 60 days:

- **Pursue Patent Protection**: Foundation files provisional patent, assigns patent attorney
- **Publish Without Protection**: Defensive publication to prevent others from patenting
- **Keep as Trade Secret**: Maintain confidentiality, no public disclosure
- **Release to Inventor**: Foundation declines ownership; inventor may pursue independently

### Inventor Rights and Obligations

**If Foundation Pursues Protection:**

- **Inventor Cooperation**: Inventor must assist with patent prosecution, signing necessary documents
- **Confidentiality**: Inventor maintains secrecy until patent filed or publication approved
- **Inventor Recognition**: Named as inventor on patent (legal requirement)
- **Revenue Sharing**: Inventor receives percentage of net royalties (see Commercialization section)

**If Foundation Releases Invention:**

- Inventor receives written release within 90 days of disclosure
- Inventor may file patent independently (Foundation has no future rights)
- Inventor may not claim Foundation endorsement or use Foundation data without permission

### Inventor Compensation

**Standard Royalty-Sharing Formula:**

| **Net Royalty Revenue** | **Inventor Share** | **Foundation Share** |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| First $100,000          | 40%                | 60%                  |
| $100,001 - $500,000     | 30%                | 70%                  |
| Over $500,000           | 20%                | 80%                  |

**"Net Royalty Revenue"** = Gross royalties minus patent prosecution costs, maintenance fees, licensing expenses, legal fees.

**Multiple Inventors**: Inventor share divided equally unless inventors agree otherwise in writing.

**Equity Sharing**: If licensee provides equity instead of cash royalties, inventors receive proportional equity stake.

**Example Calculation:**

- Licensee pays $250,000 in royalties
- Patent costs: $50,000
- Net royalties: $200,000
- Inventor share: (40% × $100K) + (30% × $100K) = $40K + $30K = **$70,000**
- Foundation share: $130,000

## Contractor and Consultant IP

### IP Assignment in Contracts

**Required Language in All Consultant/Contractor Agreements:**

> **Intellectual Property**: All work product developed under this Agreement, including inventions, works of authorship, software, and data, shall be the sole property of Mark Egly Foundation. Consultant/Contractor hereby assigns all right, title, and interest to Foundation and agrees to execute any documents necessary to perfect Foundation's ownership.

**Exceptions**: If contractor retains IP ownership (rare), agreement must specify:

- What IP contractor retains
- License granted to Foundation (exclusive, non-exclusive, perpetual, limited term)
- License fee or royalty (if applicable)
- Contractor's obligations to maintain IP and defend against infringement

### Pre-Existing IP

**Background IP**: IP developed by contractor before engagement with Foundation.

**Protection Mechanism**: Contractor lists pre-existing IP in Exhibit A to agreement.

**License Grant**: If contractor's pre-existing IP will be incorporated into Foundation work product:

> Contractor grants Foundation a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license to use Contractor's pre-existing IP listed in Exhibit A solely as incorporated into the deliverables under this Agreement.

**Example**: Web developer has pre-existing CMS template. Foundation receives license to use template in Foundation website but cannot resell template to others.

### Contractor Invention Disclosure

If contractor conceives invention during project:

1. Contractor discloses to ED within 15 days
2. Foundation evaluates (same process as employee inventions)
3. Contractor named as inventor if patent pursued
4. Contractor eligible for royalty sharing per invention compensation formula (unless agreement specifies otherwise)

---

## Research Collaborations and Academic Partnerships

### Collaborative Research IP Principles

**Default Framework for Academic Partnerships:**

1. **Publication Freedom**: Both parties have right to publish (with 30-60 day pre-publication review)
2. **Joint Ownership**: Inventions conceived jointly by both parties' researchers are jointly owned
3. **Sole Ownership**: Inventions conceived solely by one party's researchers owned by that party
4. **Licensing Rights**: Each party may license its sole inventions independently; joint inventions require mutual consent
5. **Patient Access**: All licenses include provisions ensuring patient access at reasonable cost

### Research Collaboration Agreement IP Terms

**Standard Clauses:**

**Ownership Allocation:**

> **Section 7: Intellectual Property Ownership**
>
> (a) **Sole Inventions**: Inventions conceived solely by one party's researchers shall be owned solely by that party.
>
> (b) **Joint Inventions**: Inventions conceived jointly by researchers of both parties shall be jointly owned. Each party shall have equal undivided interest and may license its interest independently, subject to Section 7(e).
>
> (c) **Invention Disclosure**: Each party shall promptly disclose inventions to the other and provide reasonable evidence of inventorship.

**Patent Prosecution:**

> **Section 8: Patent Filing and Prosecution**
>
> (a) **Joint Inventions**: Parties shall mutually agree whether to file patent applications for joint inventions. If both agree, costs and responsibilities shall be shared equally. If one party declines, the other may file at its sole expense and shall own patent rights, subject to paying the non-filing party 15% of net royalties.
>
> (b) **Sole Inventions**: Each party shall control patent prosecution for its sole inventions and bear all costs.

**Publication Rights:**

> **Section 9: Publication**
>
> Each party may publish research results, provided:
>
> (a) Publishing party provides 45 days' advance notice and manuscript copy to other party
> (b) Other party may request delay of up to 90 days to file patent applications
> (c) Other party may request removal of its confidential information unrelated to research results

**Licensing and Commercialization:**

> **Section 10: Commercialization**
>
> (a) **Sole Inventions**: Each party may license its sole inventions independently, provided licensee agrees to patient access terms ensuring availability at reasonable cost.
>
> (b) **Joint Inventions**: Neither party may license joint inventions without other party's written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld. Parties shall negotiate license terms in good faith, prioritizing patient benefit.
>
> (c) **First Negotiation Right**: If one party seeks to exclusively license joint invention, other party has 60-day right of first negotiation to license for its own development.

### Multi-Party Collaborations

**Complexity**: Three or more parties complicate ownership and licensing.

**Preferred Approach**: One party serves as lead, owns all IP, sublicenses to partners.

**Example**: Foundation, University A, and Pharma Co collaborate on biomarker study.

- **Structure**: Foundation is lead, owns IP
- University A: License-back right for non-commercial research
- Pharma Co: Exclusive option to license for commercial development
- Foundation retains: March-in rights if Pharma Co doesn't diligently develop; royalty revenue to fund further research

### Research Grant IP Terms

**Foundation-Funded Research Grants:**

When Foundation provides grants to external researchers:

**Standard Grant Agreement IP Clause:**

> **Section 6: Intellectual Property**
>
> (a) **Ownership**: Grantee Institution owns inventions made by its researchers under this grant.
>
> (b) **Foundation License**: Grantee grants Foundation a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use research results and data for Foundation's non-commercial research, education, and advocacy activities.
>
> (c) **Publication**: Grantee shall publish results in open-access journals when possible and shall acknowledge Foundation funding.
>
> (d) **Patient Access**: If Grantee commercializes inventions, license agreements must include patient access provisions ensuring availability at reasonable cost in perpetuity.
>
> (e) **March-In Rights**: If Grantee fails to commercialize within 5 years, Foundation may license to third parties to advance patient benefit.

**Federally-Funded Research:**

If Foundation research uses federal funds (NIH, NSF), Bayh-Dole Act governs:

- Grantee owns inventions but must grant U.S. government non-exclusive license
- Government has march-in rights if grantee doesn't commercialize
- Preference for U.S. manufacturing
- **Foundation's Rights**: Negotiate license or option in grant agreement

## Patent Strategy

### Patent Philosophy

**Foundation's Approach**: Strategic, selective patenting focused on:

1. **Enablement**: Patents necessary to attract development partners (e.g., pharma needs patent to justify R&D investment)
2. **Defensive**: Patents to prevent others from blocking Foundation's activities
3. **Revenue Generation**: Patents with realistic commercialization potential to fund mission

**Not Patent-Focused**: Unlike biotech companies, Foundation prioritizes research progress over IP portfolio size.

### Patentability Assessment

**Four Legal Requirements:**

1. **Novelty**: Invention not previously disclosed publicly anywhere in the world
2. **Non-Obviousness**: Invention not obvious to person skilled in the art
3. **Utility**: Invention has practical use
4. **Eligible Subject Matter**: Not abstract idea, law of nature, or natural phenomenon alone

**Foundation's "Fifth Requirement"**: Mission impact justifies cost.

### Patent Decision Framework

**Patent Evaluation Checklist:**

| **Factor**               | **Weight** | **Assessment Questions**                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Patentability**        | Mandatory  | Is invention novel, non-obvious, useful, and patent-eligible?                        |
| **Commercial Potential** | High       | Will companies license this? Is market size adequate ($100M+)?                       |
| **Development Need**     | High       | Will patent protection attract development partners?                                 |
| **Patient Impact**       | High       | Does invention significantly improve diagnosis, treatment, or outcomes?              |
| **Blocking Risk**        | Medium     | Might others patent similar inventions and block our use?                            |
| **Freedom to Operate**   | Mandatory  | Does our use infringe others' existing patents? (require FTO opinion)                |
| **Cost-Benefit**         | Medium     | Do projected revenues exceed patent costs ($15K-$50K filing + $5K/year maintenance)? |
| **Strategic Fit**        | Low        | Does patent align with Foundation's research focus areas?                            |

**Decision Rule**: Pursue patent if patentability satisfied AND at least two of: commercial potential, development need, patient impact, or blocking risk.

### Patent Process Overview

**Phase 1: Provisional Patent Application**

- **Timeline**: File within 1 year of first public disclosure
- **Cost**: $3,000-$7,000 (attorney fees) + $75-$300 (USPTO filing fee)
- **Benefits**: Establishes filing date; allows "patent pending" status; low cost; 12 months to assess commercialization
- **Limitations**: Not examined; expires in 12 months; must file non-provisional to get enforceable patent

**Phase 2: Patent Search and Freedom to Operate Opinion**

- **Timeline**: Months 3-6 after provisional
- **Cost**: $2,000-$5,000 (search) + $5,000-$15,000 (FTO opinion)
- **Output**: Report on prior art; opinion on patentability and infringement risk

**Phase 3: Non-Provisional Patent Application**

- **Timeline**: File within 12 months of provisional
- **Cost**: $8,000-$15,000 (attorney fees) + $320-$800 (USPTO filing fee)
- **Process**: Formal patent application with claims; undergoes USPTO examination

**Phase 4: Patent Prosecution**

- **Timeline**: 1-3 years from non-provisional filing
- **Cost**: $5,000-$20,000 (responses to USPTO office actions)
- **Outcome**: Patent granted or abandoned

**Phase 5: Patent Maintenance**

- **Timeline**: 3.5, 7.5, and 11.5 years after grant
- **Cost**: $2,000-$7,500 per maintenance fee (escalating)
- **Total 20-Year Cost**: $30,000-$100,000 (filing + prosecution + maintenance)

**International Patent Protection:**

- **PCT Application**: File within 12 months of U.S. provisional to preserve international filing rights
  - Cost: $5,000-$10,000
  - Provides 18 additional months to decide which countries to pursue

- **National Stage Filings**: Enter specific countries (e.g., EPO, Canada, Australia)
  - Cost: $5,000-$15,000 per country
  - Annual maintenance fees in each country

- **Foundation Approach**: U.S. only unless licensee funds international filings

### Managing Patent Portfolio

**Portfolio Review**: Annually assess each patent/application:

- **Continue Maintenance?** Does patent still have commercialization potential?
- **Abandon?** If no licensees interested and maintenance fee due, consider abandonment
- **License?** Proactively market to potential licensees

**Patent Management Software**: Consider PatentBuddy or IP Manager ($500-$2,000/year) once portfolio exceeds 5 patents.

## Open Science and Data Sharing

### Foundation's Commitment to Open Science

**Core Principle**: Maximize research impact by sharing data openly, subject to patient privacy and strategic IP considerations.

**Data Sharing Framework:**

| **Data Type**                   | **Sharing Policy**                 | **Mechanism**                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **De-identified Registry Data** | Share with qualified researchers   | Data Use Agreement (DUA)                       |
| **Published Research Data**     | Share in public repositories       | Deposit in ClinicalTrials.gov, Dryad, Figshare |
| **Aggregate Statistics**        | Publicly available                 | Website dashboard, annual reports              |
| **Identified Patient Data**     | Never shared                       | HIPAA-protected                                |
| **Pre-publication Data**        | Limited sharing with collaborators | Confidentiality Agreement                      |

### Data Use Agreements (DUAs)

**When Required**: Any sharing of de-identified registry data with external researchers.

**Standard DUA Terms** (see Data Use Agreement Template document for full template):

1. **Permitted Uses**: Research purposes only; no re-identification attempts
2. **Publication**: Researcher may publish findings; Foundation receives pre-publication copy
3. **Attribution**: Researcher acknowledges Foundation as data source
4. **No Transfer**: Researcher may not share data with third parties without Foundation permission
5. **Security**: Researcher maintains appropriate safeguards
6. **Inventions**: Any inventions using Foundation data are subject to Foundation license (see IP rights clause)
7. **Term**: Typically 2-3 years; renewable
8. **Data Destruction**: At term end, researcher destroys data or returns to Foundation

**IP Rights Clause in DUA:**

> **Section 9: Intellectual Property**
>
> Researcher retains ownership of inventions conceived using the data. Researcher grants Foundation a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use inventions for Foundation's non-commercial research and education purposes. If Researcher commercializes inventions, licensing terms must include patient access provisions ensuring availability at reasonable cost.

### Preprint and Open Access Policies

**Preprints**: Foundation encourages researchers to post preprints (e.g., bioRxiv, medRxiv) prior to peer review.

**Open Access Mandate**: Foundation-funded research must be published open access (Gold or Green).

### Open Source Software

**Foundation-Developed Software**: Default to open source unless commercialization planned.

**Recommended Licenses:**

- **MIT License**: Permissive; allows commercial use; simple
- **GPL v3**: Copyleft; requires derivative works to be open source; appropriate for patient-benefit tools
- **AGPL v3**: Like GPL but covers SaaS use; appropriate for web-based tools

**Commercial Software**: If software has commercial potential (e.g., registry platform), retain proprietary ownership and license commercially.

## Licensing and Technology Transfer

### Licensing Strategy

**Foundation's Licensing Goals:**

1. **Patient Access**: Ensure affordable, equitable access to diagnostics and treatments
2. **Development Incentive**: Provide exclusivity if necessary to attract development investment
3. **Revenue Generation**: Maximize royalties to fund mission
4. **Research Advancement**: Allow non-commercial research use

### Exclusive vs. Non-Exclusive Licensing

**Exclusive License**: Licensee is only party authorized to use IP.

**When to Grant Exclusive License:**

- Licensee requires exclusivity to justify R&D investment (common in drug development)
- Single licensee is most effective commercialization path
- Licensee pays substantial upfront fee and demonstrates development commitment

**Terms to Include in Exclusive Licenses:**

- **Field-of-Use Limits**: Exclusivity only in specific application (e.g., "therapeutic use in COPD patients with Alpha-1")
- **Geographic Limits**: Exclusivity only in specific regions (e.g., U.S. and Europe; Foundation retains rights in developing countries)
- **Diligence Milestones**: Licensee must meet development timelines (e.g., Phase I trial by Year 2, Phase II by Year 4, NDA filing by Year 7)
- **Reversion**: License reverts to Foundation if milestones not met
- **March-In Rights**: Foundation may terminate if licensee doesn't ensure reasonable patient access

**Non-Exclusive License**: Multiple parties may license IP.

**When to Grant Non-Exclusive License:**

- Diagnostic tools (want wide availability)
- Research methods
- Educational materials
- When exclusivity not required for commercialization

### License Financial Terms

**Typical Deal Structures:**

**Early-Stage Technology (Pre-clinical):**

- Upfront Fee: $0-$25,000 (or waived if exclusivity granted)
- Annual Maintenance Fee: $5,000-$25,000 (to keep exclusivity, waived if milestones met)
- Milestone Payments: $100,000-$2,000,000 (staggered: IND filing, Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, NDA approval, first commercial sale)
- Royalties: 2-5% of net sales
- Sublicensing: Foundation receives 25-50% of sublicense revenue

**Late-Stage Technology (Clinical trials underway):**

- Upfront Fee: $50,000-$500,000
- Milestones: $500,000-$5,000,000 (fewer remaining; higher payments)
- Royalties: 3-8% of net sales
- Minimum Annual Royalties: $50,000-$250,000 (once product on market)

**Diagnostic Technology:**

- Upfront Fee: $25,000-$100,000
- Royalties: $1-$5 per test performed, or 5-10% of test revenue
- Non-exclusive preferred (maximize access)

### Patient Access Provisions

**Required in All Commercial Licenses:**

> **Section 12: Patient Access**
>
> Licensee agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure Licensed Products are made available to patients at reasonable cost. Specifically:
>
> (a) **Pricing**: Licensee shall price Licensed Products no higher than median pricing for comparable products in relevant therapeutic class.
>
> (b) **Patient Assistance**: Licensee shall maintain patient assistance program providing Licensed Products at no cost to patients with demonstrated financial need.
>
> (c) **Developing Countries**: Licensee grants Foundation right to offer License for manufacture and sale in developing countries (as defined by World Bank) at reduced or no royalty.
>
> (d) **Discontinuation**: If Licensee discontinues Licensed Products, rights revert to Foundation, which may license to alternative supplier.

### License Negotiation Process

**Step 1: Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**

Potential licensee signs NDA; Foundation provides detailed technical data.

**Step 2: Term Sheet**

Parties negotiate and sign non-binding term sheet covering:

- Type of license (exclusive, non-exclusive, field-limited)
- Financial terms (upfront, milestones, royalties)
- Diligence milestones
- Patent prosecution responsibility
- Termination conditions

**Step 3: Due Diligence**

Licensee investigates IP validity, freedom to operate, technical feasibility (2-4 months).

**Step 4: Definitive License Agreement**

Attorneys draft and negotiate full license agreement (1-3 months).

**Step 5: Board Approval**

Foundation Board reviews and approves material terms (deals >$100,000 in potential value).

**Step 6: Execution**

Parties sign; upfront fee paid; license effective.

**Timeline**: 4-9 months from initial discussion to executed agreement.

### Working with Technology Transfer Partners

**Foundation's Resources**: Limited; may benefit from expert assistance.

**Options:**

1. **Technology Transfer Consultant**: Hire consultant for specific deals
   - Cost: $5,000-$25,000 per deal or 5-10% of upfront fees
   - Provides: Market analysis, licensee identification, negotiation support

2. **Partner with University Tech Transfer Office**: If co-inventor at university, leverage their TTO
   - Cost: TTO takes percentage of royalties (often 15-30%)
   - Benefit: Expertise, network, administrative support

3. **In-House Learning**: ED negotiates deals with attorney support
   - Cost: Attorney fees $5,000-$20,000 per deal
   - Benefit: Foundation retains full control and learns for future deals

**Recommendation**: Years 1-3, hire consultant for first 2-3 deals to build Foundation expertise, then transition to in-house with attorney support.

## Commercialization Strategy

### Commercialization Decision Tree

**When Invention Disclosed, Assess:**

```
Is invention patentable and within Foundation's mission?
  │
  ├─ NO → Publish openly or keep as trade secret
  │
  └─ YES → Does invention require development partner to reach patients?
      │
      ├─ NO → Foundation may develop internally (e.g., educational tool) or publish
      │
      └─ YES → Patent + license to development partner
          │
          ├─ Drug/Therapeutic → Exclusive license to pharma/biotech
          ├─ Diagnostic → Non-exclusive license to multiple labs/device companies
          ├─ Research Tool → Non-exclusive license to research community
          └─ Software → SaaS model or open source with commercial support option
```

### Commercialization Pathways

**Pathway 1: Out-Licensing to Industry Partner**

- **Best For**: Therapeutics, medical devices, diagnostics requiring FDA approval
- **Foundation's Role**: Patent, license, receive royalties
- **Partner's Role**: Development, clinical trials, regulatory approval, manufacturing, commercialization
- **Revenue**: Milestones + royalties (typically 2-8% of sales)
- **Timeline**: 5-15 years to market

**Pathway 2: Foundation Internal Development**

- **Best For**: Educational materials, patient tools, data platforms without regulatory barriers
- **Foundation's Role**: Develop, market, distribute
- **Revenue**: Direct sales or subscriptions
- **Challenge**: Requires operational capacity; risks mission creep
- **Example**: Foundation develops Alpha-1 patient registry; licenses access to researchers ($5K-$20K/year per researcher)

**Pathway 3: Startup Formation**

- **Best For**: Innovations requiring focus and speed beyond licensee's core business
- **Foundation's Role**: License IP to startup; take equity stake
- **Startup's Role**: Raise venture funding; develop product; exit via acquisition or IPO
- **Revenue**: Eventual equity sale proceeds (high risk, high reward)
- **Challenge**: Time-intensive; requires Foundation board member or advisor involvement
- **Example**: Diagnostic device spinout company; Foundation holds 10-25% equity

**Pathway 4: Open Sharing with Voluntary Licensing**

- **Best For**: Research methods, protocols, tools Foundation wants widely adopted
- **Foundation's Role**: Publish openly; offer paid training/support
- **Revenue**: Training fees, certification programs
- **Example**: Publish Alpha-1 screening protocol; offer provider training workshops ($500/participant)

### Revenue Projections and Goals

**Realistic Expectations:**

- **Years 1-5**: $0-$50,000/year (early-stage licenses, small upfront fees)
- **Years 6-10**: $50,000-$500,000/year (milestone payments from licenses)
- **Years 11+**: $500,000-$2,000,000/year (royalties from commercialized products)

**These Are Aggressive Estimates**: Most nonprofits never generate substantial IP revenue. Foundation should not rely on IP revenue for operational budget.

### Reinvestment of IP Revenue

**Allocation Policy:**

- **50%**: Fund new research grants (expand Alpha-1 research)
- **25%**: IP management costs (patent maintenance, licensing attorneys)
- **15%**: Inventor compensation (per revenue-sharing formula)
- **10%**: General operating support

---

## IP Dispute Resolution

### Infringement by Foundation

**Risk**: Foundation may inadvertently infringe third-party IP (patents, copyrights, trademarks).

**Prevention:**

- **Freedom to Operate (FTO) Opinions**: Before commercializing invention, obtain FTO opinion from patent attorney ($5,000-$15,000)
- **Licensing Content**: License photos, graphics, videos from stock libraries (Shutterstock, Getty Images) rather than using uncredited web images
- **Software Due Diligence**: Review open source licenses of software components; ensure compliance (e.g., GPL requires releasing source code)

**If Infringement Alleged:**

1. **Do Not Ignore**: Cease and desist letters require response
2. **Engage Attorney**: Immediately consult IP attorney
3. **Assess Validity**: Is claim legitimate? Often infringement letters are overreach
4. **Options**:
   - **Negotiate License**: Pay reasonable fee to continue use
   - **Cease Use**: Stop infringing activity; find alternative
   - **Challenge Validity**: If patent/copyright invalid, defend
   - **Settle**: Pay nominal settlement to avoid litigation costs

**Insurance**: Consider IP infringement insurance (Media Liability/E&O policy includes copyright defense; cost: $2,000-$5,000/year for $1M coverage).

### Infringement of Foundation IP

**Detecting Infringement:**

- Google Alerts for Foundation name, key technologies
- Monitor trademark use
- Track competitors and research community for similar innovations

**Enforcement Decision:**

Not all infringement worth pursuing. Assess:

- **Magnitude**: Is infringement minor or substantial revenue loss?
- **Intent**: Is infringer willful or unknowing?
- **Cost-Benefit**: Will enforcement cost exceed damages?
- **Mission Impact**: Does infringement harm patients or Foundation reputation?

**Enforcement Options (Escalating):**

1. **Friendly Notice**: Email infringer; request they cease or take license
   - Cost: $0
   - Success Rate: 50% (if infringement unknowing)

2. **Cease and Desist Letter**: Attorney letter demanding cessation
   - Cost: $500-$2,000
   - Success Rate: 70%

3. **DMCA Takedown** (copyright infringement online): File DMCA notice with website host
   - Cost: $0 (template notice)
   - Success Rate: 90% (hosts comply to avoid liability)

4. **Trademark Opposition/Cancellation**: Oppose trademark registration at USPTO
   - Cost: $5,000-$20,000
   - Timeline: 6-18 months

5. **Litigation**: File patent/copyright/trademark infringement lawsuit
   - Cost: $50,000-$500,000+ (through trial)
   - Timeline: 1-4 years
   - Outcome: Injunction, damages (actual or statutory), attorney fees (if willful)

**Litigation Decision**: Require Board approval and assessment of:

- Likelihood of success (>70% per attorney)
- Potential recovery (>$500,000)
- Insurance coverage (some policies cover defense costs)
- Mission alignment (will litigation advance patient benefit?)

### Alternative Dispute Resolution

**Mediation**: Neutral mediator facilitates settlement negotiation.

- Cost: $5,000-$15,000 (mediator + attorney fees)
- Timeline: 1-3 months
- Success Rate: 60-80%
- Best For: IP disputes where ongoing relationship desired (e.g., academic collaborators)

**Arbitration**: Neutral arbitrator renders binding decision.

- Cost: $20,000-$100,000 (arbitrator + attorney fees)
- Timeline: 6-12 months
- Best For: Contract disputes (e.g., royalty calculation disagreements)

**Include ADR Clauses in Agreements:**

> **Section 15: Dispute Resolution**
>
> Any disputes under this Agreement shall first be subject to good-faith negotiation between the parties. If not resolved within 30 days, parties shall submit dispute to mediation before a mutually acceptable mediator. If mediation fails, dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration under AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules in [City, State].

2. NDA (if accessing confidential information)
3. Background IP disclosure (listing any pre-existing IP)

### IP Compliance Monitoring

**Quarterly IP Review**: ED and legal counsel review:

- New inventions disclosed (any requiring patent filing?)
- Active licenses (licensees meeting milestones?)
- Trademark use (any infringement detected?)
- Copyright registrations (any high-value works to register?)

**Annual IP Audit**: Comprehensive review including:

- Employee agreements (all have IP clauses?)
- Contractor agreements (all have IP assignment?)
- Research agreements (IP terms aligned with policy?)
- Patent portfolio (maintenance fees paid? abandonments needed?)
- Trademark monitoring (oppositions needed?)

5. **Month 7-9**: Implement confidentiality and trade secret protection measures; conduct IP audit
6. **Month 10-12**: Develop license agreement templates; identify potential commercialization opportunities in existing research

**Long-Term Vision:**

The Foundation's IP portfolio becomes a strategic asset that:

- Attracts research collaborators who trust Foundation's fair IP management
- Generates revenue ($500K-$2M/year by Year 10) reinvested in new research grants
- Enables patient access to diagnostics and treatments that might not otherwise be developed
- Establishes Foundation as thought leader in patient-centered IP management for rare disease nonprofits

By treating intellectual property as a tool to advance patient benefit rather than an end in itself, the Mark Egly Foundation positions itself to maximize its impact on the Alpha-1 community and serve as a model for mission-driven IP stewardship.
