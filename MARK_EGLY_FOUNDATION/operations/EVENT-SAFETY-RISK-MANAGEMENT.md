## Event Safety Philosophy

### Why Event Safety Matters

**Reality**: Foundation hosts events for AATD patients—many with compromised lung function (FEV1 <50%), mobility limitations, oxygen dependence. Events carry inherent risks:
- **Medical emergencies**: Respiratory distress, cardiac events, falls (patient population older, sicker than general public)
- **Liability exposure**: Participant injury → lawsuit ("Foundation didn't provide adequate safety measures")
- **Reputational damage**: Serious incident → negative media coverage ("Patient dies at Mark Egly Foundation walk"—devastating)

**Moral Obligation**: Foundation invites patients to events—responsible for their safety. "First, do no harm" applies to events as much as medicine.

---

### Core Safety Principles

**1. Prevention Over Response**
- ✅ **Anticipate risks** (venue walkthrough, identify hazards—uneven pavement, narrow exits, insufficient parking)
- ✅ **Mitigate proactively** (place "Watch Your Step" signs, widen walkways, arrange shuttle service)
- ❌ **Don't react after incident** (waiting until someone trips to address hazard—too late)

**2. Participant-Appropriate Planning**
- ✅ **AATD-specific considerations**: Patients may need oxygen, frequent rest breaks, shaded seating (not generic event planning—tailor to population)
- ✅ **Family-friendly**: Events include children, elderly caregivers (diverse needs—wheelchair access, changing stations, quiet rooms)

**3. Transparency & Communication**
- ✅ **Disclose risks** (event registration: "Walk involves 2-mile outdoor route, uneven terrain—participants assume risk")
- ✅ **Clear instructions** (pre-event email: "Bring water, wear sunscreen, know your limits—medical tent available")

**4. Regulatory Compliance**
- ✅ **Permits**: City permits (parade, park use, road closures), health permits (food service), fire marshal approval (venue capacity)
- ✅ **Insurance**: Event liability coverage ($1M-$2M per occurrence)
- ✅ **ADA**: Accessibility for disabled participants (ramps, accessible restrooms, ASL interpreters if requested)

---

## Event Risk Assessment

### Risk Assessment Matrix

**Purpose**: Identify potential hazards, assess likelihood × severity, prioritize mitigation efforts.

**Risk Formula**: **Risk Score = Likelihood (1-5) × Severity (1-5)**
- **Likelihood**: 1 = Rare, 3 = Possible, 5 = Likely
- **Severity**: 1 = Minor (first aid), 3 = Moderate (ER visit), 5 = Severe (hospitalization/death)

---

### Sample Risk Assessment (AATD Awareness Walk)

| **Hazard**                | **Likelihood** | **Severity** | **Risk Score** | **Mitigation**                                  | **Residual Risk** |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Heat exhaustion**       | 4 (Hot day, exertion) | 3 (ER visit) | **12 (High)** | Water stations every 0.5 miles, start early (8am), shaded rest areas | 6 (Medium) |
| **Respiratory distress**  | 3 (AATD patients) | 4 (Hospitalization) | **12 (High)** | Medical tent staffed, AED on-site, 911 pre-notification | 8 (Medium) |
| **Trip/fall**             | 4 (Uneven pavement) | 2 (Bruising) | **8 (Medium)** | Route inspection, cones around hazards, volunteers assist elderly | 4 (Low) |
| **Allergic reaction**     | 2 (Food service) | 4 (Anaphylaxis) | **8 (Medium)** | Allergen labeling, EpiPen in first aid kit, staff trained | 4 (Low) |
| **Car accident**          | 2 (Road crossing) | 5 (Fatality) | **10 (High)** | Police-controlled crosswalk, volunteers stop traffic, safety vests | 2 (Low) |
| **Lost child**            | 3 (500 attendees) | 3 (Distress, police) | **9 (Medium)** | Wristbands with parent phone, designated reunion area, PA system | 3 (Low) |

**Risk Prioritization**: High risks (score 10+) = mandatory mitigation, Medium (6-9) = mitigate if feasible, Low (<6) = monitor but accept.

---

### Event-Specific Risk Assessments

**Outdoor Walk/Run**:
- 🔴 Weather (heat, lightning, rain)
- 🔴 Traffic (road crossings, parking lot)
- 🟡 Terrain (hills, uneven paths, obstacles)
- 🟡 Medical emergencies (cardiac, respiratory, dehydration)

**Indoor Gala/Dinner**:
- 🔴 Fire (kitchen, candles, overcrowding)
- 🟡 Food safety (contamination, allergies)
- 🟡 Alcohol over-service (DUI, altercations)
- 🟢 Trips/falls (lower risk—controlled environment)

**Patient Summit/Conference**:
- 🟡 Medical emergencies (patient population at higher risk)
- 🟡 Accessibility (wheelchair users, hearing/vision impaired)
- 🟢 Weather (indoor event—minimal exposure)
- 🟢 Food safety (catered meals—vetted vendor)

---

## Event Insurance Requirements

### Types of Event Insurance

**1. General Liability Insurance**
- **Coverage**: Bodily injury, property damage caused by event (participant trips over cable, breaks arm—insurance covers medical bills, legal defense)
- **Limits**: $1M per occurrence, $2M aggregate (standard for nonprofit events)
- **Cost**: $500-$2,000 per event (varies by attendance, activities, venue requirements)

**2. Special Event Insurance** (One-Time Coverage):
- **When Needed**: Large public events (walk with 500+ participants), events with elevated risk (obstacle course, zip line—Foundation unlikely to host, but know it exists)
- **Coverage**: Same as general liability, but specifically for single event (Foundation's annual policy may exclude certain events—require separate coverage)
- **Cost**: $300-$1,500 per event

**3. Liquor Liability** (If Serving Alcohol):
- **Coverage**: Injuries/damage caused by intoxicated guest (drunk guest drives home, causes accident—victim sues Foundation for over-serving)
- **When Required**: Galas serving wine/beer (even if not selling—giving away alcohol = liability)
- **Cost**: $500-$1,000 per event (add-on to general liability)

**4. Participant Accident Insurance** (Optional):
- **Coverage**: Medical expenses if participant injured during event (covers deductibles, copays—supplements participant's health insurance)
- **When Useful**: Athletic events (runs, obstacle courses) where injury risk higher
- **Cost**: $1-$5 per participant (inexpensive—$500 for 500-participant walk)

---

### Certificate of Insurance (COI)

**What is COI?**: Document proving Foundation has insurance—venues, cities require COI before approving event.

**COI Requirements** (Typical Venue):
- **Coverage**: $1M per occurrence, $2M aggregate general liability
- **Additional Insured**: Venue/city named as "additional insured" (if Foundation's event causes damage, venue's also protected)
- **Cancellation Notice**: Insurer will notify venue 30 days before canceling policy (protects venue from suddenly uninsured event)

**Process**:
1. Foundation contacts insurance broker (60 days before event—"Need COI for walk at City Park")
2. Broker issues COI (lists Foundation, venue as additional insured, coverage limits—PDF emailed within 2-3 days)
3. Foundation forwards COI to venue (event permit approved upon COI receipt)

---

## Liability Waivers & Release Forms

### Why Waivers Matter

**Legal Protection**: Waiver = participant acknowledges risks, agrees not to sue Foundation if injured (not bulletproof—courts can invalidate poorly written waivers, but significantly reduces liability).

**Education**: Waiver forces participants to read risks ("I understand walk involves 2 miles, uneven terrain, heat exposure"—informed consent).

---

### Waiver Template (AATD Awareness Walk)

**LIABILITY WAIVER AND RELEASE OF CLAIMS**

**Event**: Mark Egly Foundation AATD Awareness Walk
**Date**: October 15, 2026
**Location**: City Park, [City, State]

---

**1. ASSUMPTION OF RISK**

I understand that participating in the AATD Awareness Walk involves inherent risks, including but not limited to:
- Physical exertion (walking 2 miles)
- Weather conditions (heat, cold, rain, wind)
- Terrain hazards (uneven pavement, roots, obstacles)
- Medical emergencies (respiratory distress, cardiac events, dehydration)
- Traffic (crossing streets, parking lot vehicles)

I voluntarily assume all risks associated with participation.

---

**2. HEALTH REPRESENTATION**

I represent that I am in sufficient physical condition to participate safely. I have consulted my physician if I have any concerns about my ability to participate, particularly regarding my AATD condition, lung function, or other health issues.

I agree to:
- Hydrate adequately before and during the walk
- Take breaks as needed
- Stop immediately if I experience distress (shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness)
- Seek medical attention from event staff if necessary

---

**3. RELEASE OF LIABILITY**

I, on behalf of myself, my heirs, executors, and assigns, hereby RELEASE, WAIVE, DISCHARGE, and COVENANT NOT TO SUE Mark Egly Foundation, its Board of Directors, officers, employees, volunteers, sponsors, and agents (collectively "Released Parties") from any and all liability, claims, demands, or causes of action arising from my participation in the event, including those caused by the negligence of the Released Parties.

This release includes, but is not limited to:
- Personal injury or death
- Property damage or loss
- Medical expenses

---

**4. INDEMNIFICATION**

I agree to INDEMNIFY and HOLD HARMLESS the Released Parties from any claims, damages, or expenses (including attorney fees) arising from my participation.

---

**5. MEDICAL TREATMENT AUTHORIZATION**

I authorize event staff to secure emergency medical treatment if I am unable to provide consent due to incapacity. I understand I am responsible for all medical expenses incurred.

---

**6. MEDIA RELEASE**

I grant Mark Egly Foundation permission to use photographs, videos, or recordings of me taken during the event for promotional purposes (website, social media, annual reports) without compensation.

☐ Check here if you DO NOT consent to media use (we will make reasonable efforts to exclude you from photos/videos)

---

**7. ACKNOWLEDGMENT**

I have read this waiver in its entirety, understand its terms, and sign it voluntarily.

**Participant Name** (Print): _______________________________
**Signature**: _______________________________
**Date**: _______________________________

**If Participant Under 18**:
**Parent/Guardian Name** (Print): _______________________________
**Parent/Guardian Signature**: _______________________________
**Date**: _______________________________

---

**Emergency Contact**:
Name: _______________________________
Phone: _______________________________
Relationship: _______________________________

---

### Waiver Best Practices

**Timing**:
- ✅ **Online registration**: Waiver presented during registration (checkbox: "I have read and agree to waiver [link]")—legally binding
- ✅ **Day-of signature**: Paper waivers at check-in (backup for those who didn't pre-register)—staff collect before distributing bib numbers

**Language**:
- ✅ **Plain language** (not legalese—"I won't sue" vs. "I covenant not to institute legal proceedings"—readable = more likely enforceable)
- ✅ **Bold key terms** (ASSUMPTION OF RISK, RELEASE OF LIABILITY—highlights critical clauses)

**Enforceability**:
- ⚠️ **Waivers not absolute** (courts invalidate if: gross negligence, reckless conduct, minors signing own waivers—adult must sign for child)
- ✅ **Legal review**: Attorney reviews waiver ($500-$1,000 one-time—then reuse)—ensures state law compliance

---

**2. MEDICAL EMERGENCIES**

**Life-Threatening** (Cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, severe allergic reaction):

**Actions**:
1. **Call 911 immediately** (don't wait—state: "Medical emergency at City Park, 123 Park Ave, near main pavilion, patient unresponsive/in distress")
2. **Start CPR if needed** (trained volunteer—continue until EMS arrives)
3. **Deploy AED** (located in Medical Tent—apply pads, follow prompts)
4. **Clear area** (volunteers create 20-foot perimeter—give patient privacy, EMS access)
5. **Meet EMS at entrance** (volunteer guides ambulance to patient—saves critical minutes)

**Non-Life-Threatening** (Minor injuries, dehydration, overheating):

**Actions**:
1. **Escort to Medical Tent** (volunteer assists patient to tent—don't leave unattended)
2. **Medical assessment** (EMT/nurse triages—decide if 911, rest and monitor, or dismiss)
3. **Document incident** (Incident Report Form—name, time, symptoms, treatment, outcome)

---

**3. SEVERE WEATHER**

**Lightning**:
- **30-30 Rule**: If thunder <30 seconds after lightning flash, seek shelter—wait 30 minutes after last thunder before resuming
- **Shelter locations**: Indoor pavilion (capacity 200), nearby community center (0.3 miles), participant vehicles
- **Communication**: PA announcement ("Lightning detected—proceed to pavilion immediately, walk suspended")

**Extreme Heat** (Heat Index >105°F):
- **Prevention**: Postpone start time (8am → 7am), add water stations, shorten route (2 miles → 1 mile loop, participants choose # laps)
- **Signs of heat illness**: Confusion, nausea, rapid heart rate, hot dry skin—move to shade, cool with wet towels, call 911 if unresponsive

**Heavy Rain/Flooding**:
- **Cancellation threshold**: Forecast >70% chance heavy rain (>0.5 inches/hour)—cancel 24 hours prior, email participants
- **Day-of decision**: If rain starts mid-event, suspend walk (PA announcement), direct participants to shelter, evaluate if resuming safe

---

**4. MISSING CHILD**

**Actions**:
1. **Initiate lockdown** (volunteers stationed at all exits—no one leaves until child found)
2. **PA announcement**: "Attention: We're looking for [child name, age, description, clothing]. If seen, bring to Registration Tent immediately."
3. **Search teams**: Volunteers sweep venue in 5-minute intervals (check restrooms, behind buildings, parking lot)
4. **Call 911** (if not found within 10 minutes—possible abduction, police respond)

**Prevention**:
- **Child ID wristbands**: Parent's cell phone written on wristband (if child lost, staff can call parent)
- **Designated reunion area**: "If separated from parent, go to Registration Tent—staff will help"

---

**5. FIRE/EVACUATION**

**Evacuation Routes**: (Map attached—Appendix A)
- **Primary exit**: Main entrance (south gate)
- **Secondary exits**: East gate, west service road

**Assembly Point**: Parking lot (north side, away from building)

**Actions**:
1. **Trigger alarm** (pull fire alarm if indoors, or PA announcement if outdoors: "Evacuate immediately, proceed to parking lot")
2. **Account for participants** (Volunteer Coordinator checks registration list—ensure all participants accounted for)
3. **Call 911** (report fire, number of people evacuated, anyone missing)

---

## Medical Support & First Aid

### On-Site Medical Staffing

**Requirements**:
- **Small events** (<100 participants): 1 EMT or nurse (4-hour shift, $200-$400)
- **Medium events** (100-500 participants): 2 EMTs or 1 paramedic (6-hour shift, $400-$800)
- **Large events** (500+ participants): 2 paramedics + ambulance on standby ($1,500-$3,000)

**Recruitment**:

- **Sprains/fractures**: RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation), splinting basics
- **Heat illness recognition**: Symptoms, cooling techniques, when to call 911

---

## Venue Safety Inspections

### Pre-Event Walkthrough Checklist

**Timing**: 7-14 days before event (allows time to address issues).

**Inspection Team**: Event Director, Volunteer Coordinator, venue representative.

---

**1. Accessibility**

- [ ] **Parking**: Accessible spaces (1 per 25 spaces, van-accessible, signage)
- [ ] **Pathways**: Ramps where needed (1:12 slope max), width 36" minimum (wheelchair passage)
- [ ] **Restrooms**: Accessible stalls (1 per 6 regular stalls, grab bars, 60" turning radius)
- [ ] **Seating**: Wheelchair spaces at tables/viewing areas (remove chairs, leave 30×48" space)

**2. Hazards**

- [ ] **Trip hazards**: Cords taped down, uneven pavement marked with cones/caution tape, roots/cracks repaired or signed
- [ ] **Overhead clearances**: Awnings, branches >7 feet high (avoid head strikes)
- [ ] **Water hazards**: Ponds/streams fenced or signed ("No Swimming—Deep Water")

**3. Emergency Access**

- [ ] **Fire extinguishers**: ABC-rated, inspected within 1 year (tag), accessible (not blocked)
- [ ] **Exits**: Clearly marked (lit EXIT signs), unobstructed (no boxes, chairs blocking), push-bars working
- [ ] **Emergency vehicle access**: Roads/pathways wide enough for ambulance (10 feet min), identify ambulance staging area

**4. Weather Protection**

- [ ] **Shade**: Tents, pavilions, trees (50% of seating in shade—AATD patients overheat easily)
- [ ] **Hydration stations**: 1 per 100 participants, coolers with ice, cups (compostable)
- [ ] **Shelter**: Indoor space identified for lightning/rain evacuation

**5. Sanitation**

- [ ] **Restrooms**: 1 toilet per 75 participants (first 3 hours), hand-washing stations, stocked (toilet paper, soap, paper towels)
- [ ] **Hand sanitizer**: Stations at food areas, near restrooms
- [ ] **Trash/recycling**: Bins every 50 feet, clearly labeled, volunteers empty hourly

---

## ADA Compliance & Accessibility

### Legal Requirement

**Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)**: Foundation events = "public accommodations"—must be accessible to people with disabilities (wheelchair users, blind, deaf, cognitive impairments).

**Consequences of Non-Compliance**: Complaints to Department of Justice, fines ($55K-$75K first violation, $150K subsequent), lawsuits (plaintiff attorney fees paid by Foundation—expensive).

---

### Accessibility Checklist

**Physical Access**:
- ✅ **Wheelchair-accessible route** (from parking to all event areas—smooth, firm, slip-resistant surface, max 1:12 slope)
- ✅ **Accessible seating**: Reserved wheelchair spaces (companion seats adjacent), dispersed throughout venue (not all in back)
- ✅ **Service animal accommodations**: Water bowls, waste bags, relief areas (designated grassy spot away from foot traffic)

**Communication Access**:
- ✅ **ASL interpreters** (if requested 72 hours in advance—Foundation provides at no cost to participant, $50-$150/hour)
- ✅ **Large-print materials** (registration forms, programs—14-point font minimum)
- ✅ **Audio announcements** (PA system for directional info, emergency instructions—don't rely on visual-only)

**Sensory Accommodations**:
- ✅ **Quiet room** (for participants with sensory sensitivities—autism, PTSD, overstimulation—dim lights, soft music, comfortable seating)
- ✅ **Allergen-free options** (food service—clearly labeled gluten-free, nut-free, dairy-free, vegan)

---

### Reasonable Accommodation Requests

**Process**:
1. **Request**: Participant emails Foundation ("I use wheelchair, will event be accessible?" or "I'm deaf, can you provide ASL interpreter?")
2. **Response**: Within 48 hours ("Yes, event fully accessible" or "We'll arrange interpreter—please confirm 72 hours before event")
3. **Provision**: Foundation arranges accommodation (books interpreter, reserves accessible parking, coordinates with venue)
4. **Cost**: Foundation bears cost (not passed to participant—ADA requires this)

**Common Requests**:
- ASL interpreter ($300-$600 for 4-hour event)
- Large-print program ($50-$100 to reprint 20 copies at 14-point font)
- Dietary accommodations (usually $0—caterer already provides vegetarian/gluten-free, just communicate participant needs)

---

## Food Safety & Allergies

### Food Safety Requirements

**Health Permit** (If Serving Food):
- **When required**: Events serving food to 50+ people (city/county health department permit—$50-$200)
- **Inspection**: Health inspector may visit day-of (checks food temps, handwashing, cross-contamination prevention)

**Safe Food Handling**:
- ✅ **Temperature control**: Hot foods >140°F, cold foods <40°F (use chafing dishes, ice baths, thermometers)
- ✅ **Cross-contamination prevention**: Separate utensils for each dish (don't use same spoon for pasta and salad), gloves for servers
- ✅ **Handwashing**: Soap, water, paper towels at food prep area (or hand sanitizer stations)

---

### Allergen Management

**"Big 8" Allergens** (90% of food allergies):
1. Milk
2. Eggs
3. Fish
4. Shellfish
5. Tree nuts
6. Peanuts
7. Wheat
8. Soybeans

**Labeling**:
- **Buffet cards**: Each dish labeled with name + allergens ("Pasta Salad—Contains: wheat, eggs, dairy")
- **Ingredient lists**: Available at food table (binder with full recipes—participants can check if uncertain)

**Cross-Contamination Prevention**:
- ✅ **Nut-free zone**: If serving nut-containing foods (granola bars), designate separate table (avoid airborne particles, shared utensils)
- ✅ **Gluten-free handling**: Prepare gluten-free items first (before flour-based), use separate cutting boards/utensils

**Emergency Preparedness**:
- ✅ **EpiPen availability**: Medical tent has 2 EpiPens (severe allergic reactions—anaphylaxis can occur within minutes)
- ✅ **Staff training**: Recognize anaphylaxis symptoms (hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, vomiting)—administer EpiPen, call 911

---

## Weather Contingency Plans

### Weather Decision-Making Timeline

**7 Days Before Event**:
- Monitor forecast (Weather.com, NOAA, local news)
- If severe weather likely (>50% chance thunderstorms, heat index >105°F), consider postponement

**72 Hours Before**:
- **Go/No-Go Decision Point** (if postponing, notify participants via email, social media, phone calls)
- Alternative date (next Saturday, or rain date pre-announced during registration)

**24 Hours Before**:
- Final forecast check (conditions improved or worsened?)
- **Cancellation deadline** (if canceling, notify immediately—participants traveling from out-of-town need notice)

**Day-Of**:
- Monitor radar (NOAA Weather Radio, Weather.com app—real-time updates)
- **On-site decision**: Event Director empowered to suspend/cancel if conditions deteriorate (lightning within 10 miles, heat index spikes)

---

### Weather-Specific Plans

**Heat** (Heat Index >100°F):
- **Modifications**: Earlier start time (7am vs. 9am), shorter route (1 mile vs. 2 miles), extra water stations (every 0.25 miles)
- **Cancellation threshold**: Heat index >110°F (dangerously hot—cancel)

**Cold** (Temperature <40°F):
- **Modifications**: Heated tents (propane heaters—$50-$100 rental), hot beverages (coffee, hot chocolate), encourage layers
- **Participant screening**: AATD patients with severe lung disease may struggle in cold (respiratory distress)—advise consult physician before participating

**Lightning**:
- **Suspension**: Any lightning within 10 miles (thunder <30 seconds after flash)—suspend immediately, shelter for 30 minutes after last thunder
- **Cancellation**: If lightning persists >1 hour—cancel (can't wait indefinitely)

**Rain**:
- **Light rain** (<0.1 inch/hour): Proceed (provide ponchos, umbrella stations)
- **Heavy rain** (>0.25 inch/hour): Suspend (slippery conditions, visibility poor), evaluate if resuming safe
- **Flooding**: Cancel if venue flooded (standing water >2 inches, parking lots inaccessible)

---

## Security & Crowd Management

### Event Security Needs

**Small Events** (<100 participants):
- **Volunteer monitors**: 2-3 volunteers at entrances (check registrations, direct parking)—no professional security needed

**Medium Events** (100-500 participants):
- **Professional security**: 1-2 off-duty police officers ($50-$75/hour, 4-hour minimum) or private security ($25-$40/hour)
- **Roles**: Parking control, entrance monitoring, conflict de-escalation

**Large Events** (500+ participants):
- **Security team**: 4-6 officers (police or private), 1 supervisor
- **Traffic control**: Police-managed road closures (if walk crosses streets—requires city permit, police detail $1,000-$2,000)

---

### Crowd Management Strategies

**Staggered Start Times** (Large Walks):
- **Problem**: 500 people starting simultaneously = bottleneck, congestion, trip hazards
- **Solution**: Wave starts (first 100 start at 9:00am, next 100 at 9:05am, etc.)—spreads crowd, reduces congestion

**Clear Signage**:
- **Directional**: Arrows every 50 feet ("Walk Route →"), "You Are Here" maps at intersections
- **Informational**: "Water Station 0.5 Miles Ahead," "Medical Tent →"
- **Safety**: "Caution: Uneven Pavement," "Watch for Traffic"

**Volunteer Positioning**:
- **Intersections**: Volunteers at every route intersection (answer questions, ensure participants turn correctly—prevent lost participants)
- **Water stations**: 2 volunteers per station (one pours water, one manages trash—keeps lines moving)

---

2. **Document scene** (photos of hazard, incident location—preserve evidence)
3. **Contact participant** (ED or staff calls participant evening after event—"How are you? Do you need anything?"—shows concern, may reduce lawsuit likelihood)

**Within 7 Days**:
4. **Review with leadership team** (ED + Board Chair discuss—"What went wrong? How do we prevent recurrence?")
5. **Implement corrective actions** (address root cause—repair hazard, update procedures, train staff)

**Within 30 Days**:
6. **Follow up with participant** (check recovery status, offer assistance—"Medical bills? We can help with claim process")

## Post-Event Safety Review

### Safety Debrief Meeting

**Timing**: Within 7 days of event (while memories fresh).

**Attendees**: Event Director, Volunteer Coordinator, Medical Lead, 2-3 frontline volunteers (those who interacted with participants).

**Agenda** (60 minutes):
1. **What went well?** (10 min): Celebrate successes ("No major injuries, medical tent handled 5 minor cases efficiently")
2. **What went wrong?** (20 min): Identify issues ("Water stations ran dry at mile 1.5, participants complained of long lines at registration")
3. **Root cause analysis** (15 min): Why did issues occur? ("Underestimated water consumption—500 participants, only 10 gallons provided, needed 20 gallons")
4. **Corrective actions** (10 min): Specific fixes ("Next year: 2 gallons per 50 participants, restock water stations hourly")
5. **Assign owners** (5 min): Who implements each action, by when?

### Safety Metrics

**Track year-over-year**:
- **Incident rate**: # incidents per 100 participants (Year 1: 2 incidents / 200 participants = 1.0%, Year 2: 1 incident / 350 participants = 0.3%—improvement)
- **Severity**: # of 911 calls, ER transports (Year 1: 1 ambulance, Year 2: 0—improvement)
- **Near misses**: Hazards identified but didn't cause injury (Year 1: 3 near misses, Year 2: 1—proactive mitigation working)

**Goal**: Continuous improvement (reduce incident rate by 25% year-over-year, zero serious injuries).
