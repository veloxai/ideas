## Budget Philosophy & Principles

### Foundation's Budgeting Values

**Principle 1: Mission-Driven Resource Allocation**
Every dollar budgeted must advance AATD patient advocacy, research, education, or support. Budget is strategic document—not just financial spreadsheet.

**Principle 2: Fiscal Responsibility**
Budget balanced (revenues ≥ expenses) or planned deficit funded by reserves. No surprise deficits, no wishful revenue projections.

**Principle 3: Transparency & Accountability**
All departments participate, Board approves, staff held accountable. Budget assumptions documented, variances explained.

**Principle 4: Flexibility Within Discipline**
Budget is roadmap, not handcuffs—allow reasonable adjustments (10-15% between line items) without Board re-approval, but major changes require oversight.

**Principle 5: Growth Mindset**
Budget for impact, not just survival. If opportunity arises (major grant, new partnership), Foundation can adapt—but within fiscal prudence.

- **Scope**: Day-to-day operations (salaries, programs, rent, supplies)
- **Timeframe**: Fiscal year (January 1 - December 31)
- **Purpose**: Authorize spending, guide operations, measure performance

**Capital Budget** (See Capital Budget Section):
- **Scope**: Long-term assets (building renovations, equipment >$5K, technology infrastructure)
- **Timeframe**: Multi-year (5-10 year plan)
- **Purpose**: Plan major investments, assess ROI

**Program Budgets** (See Program-Level Section):
- **Scope**: Individual programs (Patient Navigation, Research Grants, Education)
- **Timeframe**: Program duration (1-3 years, often aligned with grants)
- **Purpose**: Track program-specific revenues/expenses, evaluate program sustainability

## Revenue Projections & Forecasting

### Revenue Forecasting Methods

**Method 1: Historical Trend Analysis** (Most Common)
- **Data**: Review past 3-5 years revenue by source
- **Trend**: Calculate average annual growth rate
- **Projection**: Apply growth rate to current year, adjust for known changes

**Example**:
- FY2023 individual giving: $400,000
- FY2024 individual giving: $450,000 (12.5% growth)
- FY2025 individual giving: $500,000 (11.1% growth)
- **Average growth**: 11.8%/year
- **FY2026 projection**: $500,000 × 1.118 = $559,000 (round to $560,000)

---

**Method 2: Pipeline Analysis** (For Grants, Major Gifts)
- **Identify prospects**: All active grant applications, donor cultivation
- **Assign probability**: High (70-90%), Medium (40-60%), Low (10-30%)
- **Calculate expected value**: Amount × Probability

**Example**:

| **Grant/Donor**      | **Amount** | **Probability** | **Expected Value** | **Decision Timeline** |
| -------------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| ABC Foundation       | $150,000   | 80% (finalist)  | $120,000           | November 2025         |
| XYZ Corporation      | $100,000   | 50% (submitted) | $50,000            | January 2026          |
| Smith Family (donor) | $50,000    | 70% (cultivated)| $35,000            | Q1 2026               |
| Federal Grant (HRSA) | $500,000   | 30% (competitive)| $150,000          | March 2026            |
| **Total Pipeline**   | **$800,000**| -              | **$355,000**       |                       |

**Conservative Budget**: Use expected value ($355,000), not full pipeline ($800,000)—avoids over-optimistic budgeting.

---

**Method 3: Capacity-Based Forecasting** (For Donor Acquisition)
- **Calculate capacity**: How many donors can Development team cultivate/solicit?
- **Apply conversion rates**: Based on historical data

**Example**:
- **Major gift prospects**: 50 identified, 2 FTE staff can manage 25 each
- **Conversion rate**: 20% (10 donors will give)
- **Average gift**: $30,000
- **Revenue**: 10 donors × $30,000 = **$300,000**

---

### Conservative vs. Optimistic Budgeting

**Conservative Approach** (Foundation's Policy for Year 1-3):
- **Revenue**: Budget 85-90% of realistic projections (cushion for underperformance)
- **Expenses**: Budget 100-105% of realistic needs (cushion for overruns)
- **Result**: Built-in surplus or small planned deficit (covered by reserves)

**Balanced Approach** (Year 4-7):
- **Revenue**: Budget 90-95% of projections
- **Expenses**: Budget 100% of needs
- **Result**: Breakeven or small surplus

**Growth Approach** (Year 8+, Mature Foundation):
- **Revenue**: Budget 95-100% of projections (confidence in fundraising capacity)
- **Expenses**: Budget 100-105% (invest in growth—new programs, staff)
- **Result**: Balanced budget, strategic investments

**Foundation's FY2026 Budget Stance**: Balanced (Year 5 of operations, proven track record, confident in $1.77M revenue projection).

## Expense Budget Development

### Cost Categories

**Fixed Costs** (predictable, recurring):
- Salaries & benefits (contractual)
- Rent (lease agreement)
- Insurance premiums (annual policies)
- Software subscriptions (annual licenses)
- **Total fixed**: ~70-75% of operating budget

**Variable Costs** (fluctuate with activity):
- Program supplies (depends on # patients served)
- Travel (depends on # conferences, donor visits)
- Marketing (campaign-driven)
- Event expenses (depend on event size)
- **Total variable**: ~15-20% of operating budget

**Semi-Variable Costs** (partially fixed, partially variable):
- Utilities (base cost + usage)
- Postage (some regular mailings, some ad-hoc)
- Professional development (some budgeted, some opportunistic)
- **Total semi-variable**: ~5-10% of operating budget

**Budget Flexibility**: Variable costs easier to cut if revenue shortfall (pause marketing campaign, reduce travel)—fixed costs harder (can't fire staff mid-year without cause, can't break lease).

---

### Zero-Based vs. Incremental Budgeting

**Incremental Budgeting** (Common, Efficient):
- Start with prior year's budget
- Apply inflation adjustments (3% for most categories)
- Add new initiatives (new programs, staff)
- **Pros**: Fast, simple, maintains continuity
- **Cons**: Perpetuates inefficiencies ("we've always spent $50K on X")

**Zero-Based Budgeting** (Time-Intensive, Strategic):
- Start from zero each year
- Justify every dollar (even existing programs)
- **Pros**: Forces prioritization, identifies waste
- **Cons**: Labor-intensive, can disrupt operations

**Foundation's Approach**:
- **Incremental budgeting** (Year 1-5)—building infrastructure, rapid growth
- **Zero-based budgeting** (every 3-5 years)—strategic reset, ensure alignment with evolved mission

## Program-Level Budgeting

### Program Budget Template

**Program**: Patient Navigation Program
**Duration**: January 1, 2026 - December 31, 2026

**Revenue**:

| **Source**                | **Amount**  | **Status**       |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| ABC Foundation Grant      | $150,000    | Awarded          |
| XYZ Corporate Grant       | $75,000     | Pending (80%)    |
| Endowment Distribution    | $25,000     | Unrestricted     |
| Program Fees (sliding scale)| $15,000   | Earned revenue   |
| **Total Revenue**         | **$265,000**|                  |

**Expenses**:

| **Category**              | **Amount**  | **% of Budget** |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| **Personnel**             |             |                 |
| Program Manager (1.0 FTE) | $93,730     | 35%             |
| Patient Navigators (2.0)  | $160,680    | 61%             |
| Admin Support (0.2 FTE)   | $12,051     | 5%              |
| **Subtotal Personnel**    | **$266,461**| **101%**        |
| **Program Expenses**      |             |                 |
| Educational Materials     | $8,000      | 3%              |
| Travel (patient visits)   | $5,000      | 2%              |
| Technology (CRM)          | $3,000      | 1%              |
| Training                  | $2,000      | 1%              |
| **Subtotal Program**      | **$18,000** | **7%**          |
| **Indirect (10%)**        | $28,446     | 11%             |
| **Total Expenses**        | **$312,907**| **118%**        |

**Gap**: Revenue $265,000 - Expenses $312,907 = **-$47,907 deficit**

**Gap Funding**:
- Foundation unrestricted funds: $30,000
- Additional grant application (DEF Foundation): $20,000 (pending)
- **Total Gap Funding**: $50,000 ✅

**Program ROI**:
- **Patients served**: 200
- **Cost per patient**: $312,907 ÷ 200 = **$1,565/patient**
- **Value**: Patients diagnosed → start treatment → avoid $15K hospitalization = **10× ROI**

---

### Program Sustainability Analysis

**Questions to Answer**:
1. **Is program self-sustaining?** (Revenue ≥ Direct Costs)
   - Patient Navigation: No (needs subsidy)—justified by mission impact
2. **Can program scale?** (Adding 100 patients = how much cost increase?)
   - Variable cost: $300/patient (materials, travel)
   - Fixed cost: $266,461 (staff—can serve 200-250 patients before needing 3rd navigator)
3. **What if grant ends?** (ABC Foundation doesn't renew)
   - Options: Find replacement funder, reduce scope (serve 100 patients, not 200), use reserves (1 year max)

---

## Restricted vs. Unrestricted Funds

### Fund Accounting Basics

**Unrestricted Funds**:
- **Definition**: No donor restrictions—Board discretion how spent
- **Sources**: Individual donations, unrestricted grants, event revenue, investment income
- **Uses**: Operations, programs, reserves, strategic initiatives
- **Accounting**: "Net Assets Without Donor Restrictions" (GAAP term)

**Temporarily Restricted Funds**:
- **Definition**: Donor restricts use (purpose or time)
- **Example**: "$100,000 for AATD research grants, to be spent by December 31, 2026"
- **Sources**: Restricted grants, donor-designated gifts
- **Uses**: Only for restricted purpose (Foundation must track, prove compliance)
- **Accounting**: "Net Assets With Donor Restrictions" → Released when spent on purpose

**Permanently Restricted Funds**:
- **Definition**: Endowment principal—never spent (only income spent)
- **Example**: "$1M endowment, spend 5% annually ($50K) forever"
- **Accounting**: "Net Assets With Donor Restrictions—Perpetual"

---

### Budget by Fund Type

**FY2026 Budget Summary**:

| **Fund Type**             | **Revenue**  | **Expenses** | **Surplus/(Deficit)** | **% of Budget** |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | --------------------- | --------------- |
| **Unrestricted**          | $1,000,000   | $1,100,000   | ($100,000)            | 57%             |
| **Temporarily Restricted**| $720,000     | $670,000     | $50,000               | 43%             |
| **Permanently Restricted**| $50,000      | $0           | $50,000               | (endowment distribution, moved to unrestricted) |
| **Total**                 | **$1,770,000**| **$1,770,000**| **$0**               | **100%**        |

**Interpretation**:
- Unrestricted deficit ($100K) funded by: Releasing restricted funds ($50K) + reserves ($50K)
- Temporarily restricted surplus ($50K) = grants received but not yet spent (carry forward to FY2027)

---

## Budget Consolidation & Review

### CFO Consolidation Process (September)

**Step 1: Compile All Departmental Budgets**
- Import revenue projections into master budget spreadsheet
- Import expense projections by department, category
- Calculate totals (revenue, expenses, surplus/deficit)

**Step 2: Identify Gaps**
- Revenue shortfall: Projected expenses $1.9M, revenue $1.7M = $200K gap
- Over-optimistic projections: Development projects 50% growth (realistic?)

**Step 3: Facilitate Trade-Offs** (Budget Review Meetings)
- **If revenue shortfall**:
  - Ask Development to increase goal OR
  - Ask departments to trim expenses (10% across-the-board cut) OR
  - Board approves planned deficit (funded by reserves)
- **If conflicting priorities**:
  - Program wants 3 new navigators ($300K), Research wants 5 grants ($250K), total $550K available → negotiate compromise (2 navigators + 4 grants)

---

### Budget Scenarios

**Scenario Planning** (Test "What-If" Assumptions):

**Scenario 1: Base Case** (Current Projections)
- Revenue: $1,770,000
- Expenses: $1,770,000
- Surplus: $0

**Scenario 2: Revenue Shortfall** (15% Below Projections)
- Revenue: $1,505,000 (15% lower)
- Expenses: $1,770,000 (unchanged)
- Deficit: $265,000
- **Response**: Tap reserves ($150K) + cut non-personnel expenses 10% ($80K) + delay hiring Grants Manager ($70K) = balanced

**Scenario 3: Revenue Windfall** (Unexpected $500K Bequest)
- Revenue: $2,270,000
- Expenses: $1,770,000 (unchanged)
- Surplus: $500,000
- **Response**: Allocate $250K to reserves (boost to 6 months), $150K to capital projects (website redesign, database), $100K to strategic initiative (launch new program pilot)

**Scenario 4: Major Grant Loss** (HRSA Grant Denied—$150K)
- Revenue: $1,620,000
- Expenses: $1,770,000
- Deficit: $150,000
- **Response**: Freeze hiring ($70K), reduce program expenses 10% ($40K), use reserves ($40K) = balanced

**Value**: Board sees Foundation prepared for best/worst cases—builds confidence.

## Board Approval Process

### Finance Committee Review (November)

**Pre-Meeting Materials** (Distributed 7 Days Prior):
- Draft FY2026 budget (summary + detailed line items)

### Variance Explanations

**Revenue Variances**:
- **Individual Giving +30%**: Year-end appeal stronger than expected ($15K over budget)—*favorable, monitor if sustainable*
- **Foundation Grants -100%**: ABC Foundation grant payment delayed to February (contract signed, check in mail)—*timing issue, not concern*
- **Corporate Grants +200%**: Grifols paid full-year grant upfront ($50K) instead of quarterly—*favorable, adjust cash flow*
- **Events -76%**: Gala scheduled for November, no event revenue in January—*expected, on track*

**Expense Variances**:
- **Personnel 0%**: Salaries on target—*on track*
- **Program Expenses -17%**: Research grants awarded in Q2 ($150K budgeted, $0 spent Jan)—*timing, not underspending*
- **Operations -10%**: Website redesign delayed (vendor contract negotiation)—*will catch up Q2*

**Overall Assessment**: January deficit ($14,615) = timing variances (grants, events). No corrective action needed. Monitor February—expect ABC grant payment to swing positive.

---

### Corrective Actions

**When to Take Action**:
- ✅ **Adverse trend** (3+ months underperforming)
- ✅ **Material variance** (>10% off budget for 2+ consecutive months)
- ✅ **Structural issue** (budget assumption wrong—e.g., grant denied, major donor withdrew)

**Action Options**:
1. **Reduce discretionary expenses** (travel, consulting, conferences)
2. **Defer hiring** (push new position from Q2 to Q3)
3. **Increase fundraising** (extra donor solicitations, emergency appeal)
4. **Use reserves** (temporary bridge—not long-term solution)
5. **Board amendment** (formal budget revision if >10% change)

---

## Budget Amendments & Adjustments

### When Amendment Required

**Board Re-Approval Needed If**:
- Total budget changes >10% ($177K for $1.77M budget)
- New program added (not in original budget)
- Major revenue source lost (>$100K grant denied)
- Strategic shift (Board decides to launch new initiative mid-year)

**Process**:
1. CFO prepares amendment memo (justification, revised budget, impact on reserves)
2. Finance Committee reviews, recommends to Board
3. Board votes (simple majority)
4. Amended budget becomes official

---

### Line-Item Flexibility

**Allowed Without Board Re-Approval**:
- Transfers <10% between line items within same category (e.g., move $5K from "Supplies" to "Postage" within Operations)
- Transfers between departments if total budget unchanged (e.g., move $10K from Development to Programs—requires CFO + ED approval)

**Not Allowed Without Board Approval**:
- Transfers >10% between major categories (e.g., move $100K from Programs to Personnel)
- Overspending total budget (creates deficit beyond approved level)

**Documentation**: All line-item transfers logged in "Budget Adjustment Register"—reported to Board quarterly.

- Programs double (200 patients → 400 → 600)
- Fundraising capacity grows (hire Grants Manager, Major Gifts Officer)
- Government grant secured (HRSA $500K over 3 years)

### 5-10 Year Strategic Forecast

**Long-Term Vision** (Year 10):
- **Revenue**: $10M-$15M (national presence, 10,000 patients served)
- **Endowment**: $25M-$50M (generates $1.25M-$2.5M annually, 15-25% of budget)
- **Staff**: 50-75 FTEs (program managers, researchers, policy advocates)
- **Programs**: Patient navigation nationwide, $5M research grant program, policy center influencing federal legislation

## Capital Budget vs. Operating Budget

### Capital Budget Overview

**Definition**: Expenditures on assets with useful life >1 year and cost >$5,000 (Foundation's capitalization threshold).

**Examples**:
- Office furniture ($25K)
- Database system ($50K)
- Website redesign ($30K)
- Office build-out ($100K)

**Accounting Treatment**:
- Capitalize (record as asset on balance sheet)
- Depreciate over useful life (furniture 7 years, technology 3 years)
- Annual depreciation expense flows through operating budget

### Capital Budget Process

**5-Year Capital Plan** (Updated Annually):

| **Project**            | **Year** | **Cost**  | **Funding Source**      | **ROI/Justification**                        |
| ---------------------- | -------- | --------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Office Expansion       | 2026     | $100,000  | Capital campaign        | Add 1,000 sq ft, accommodate 5 new staff     |
| CRM System Upgrade     | 2026     | $50,000   | Unrestricted funds      | Improve donor tracking, save 200 hrs/year    |
| Website Redesign       | 2027     | $75,000   | Corporate grant         | Increase online giving 30%, better UX        |
| Database Migration     | 2028     | $100,000  | Technology grant        | Cloud-based, HIPAA-compliant patient records |
| Office Furniture       | 2029     | $40,000   | Operating budget        | Replace 10-year-old furniture                |
| **Total Capital Plan** |          | **$365,000** |                      | Supports 20-staff organization               |

**Board Approval**: Capital projects >$25K require Board vote (separate from operating budget approval).

## Cash Flow Projections

### Why Cash Flow Matters

**Budget shows profitability** (revenue ≥ expenses over full year)—but doesn't show **timing** (when money comes in vs. goes out).

**Cash Flow Risk**: Foundation might be "profitable" on paper but run out of cash mid-year (grants pay quarterly, salaries biweekly).

**Analysis**:
- **Summer Cash Crunch** (Aug-Oct): Cash drops to $10K (critical—barely covers 2 days expenses)
- **Cause**: Gala revenue ($250K) doesn't arrive until November, but expenses steady all year
- **Solution**: Line of credit ($100K), draw in August, repay in November after gala

---

### Cash Management Strategies

**Strategy 1: Line of Credit**
- **Setup**: Negotiate $100K-$200K line of credit with bank (interest rate 6-8%)
- **Use**: Bridge summer cash crunch (draw $50K-$100K Aug-Sep, repay Oct-Nov)
- **Cost**: $2K-$4K interest annually (small price for cash security)

**Strategy 2: Reserves**
- **Maintain 3-6 months operating expenses** ($500K-$1M in bank)
- **Use reserves temporarily** (replenish when revenue arrives)

**Strategy 3: Accelerate Revenue**
- **Quarterly grant payments**: Negotiate with funders to pay quarterly, not annually
- **Advance event revenue**: Sell gala tickets July-August (3 months early)—improves Aug-Oct cash

**Strategy 4: Defer Expenses**
- **Schedule capital projects after gala** (office expansion happens December, not July)
- **Defer discretionary expenses** (conference attendance in Q4, not Q2)

---

## Contingency Planning & Reserves

### Operating Reserves Policy

**Foundation Policy**: Maintain **3-6 months operating expenses** in unrestricted cash reserves.

**Calculation** (FY2026):
- Annual expenses: $1,770,000
- Monthly expenses: $147,500
- **3 months**: $442,500
- **6 months**: $885,000

**Current Reserves** (End of FY2025): $500,000 (3.4 months)—**at minimum threshold**, need to grow.

### Reserve Building Plan

**FY2026-2028 Reserve Targets**:

| **Year** | **Total Expenses** | **3 Months** | **6 Months** | **Actual Reserves** | **Months Coverage** | **Status** |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- | ---------- |
| FY2025   | $1,500,000         | $375,000     | $750,000     | $500,000            | 4.0 months          | ✅ OK      |
| FY2026   | $1,770,000         | $442,500     | $885,000     | $485,000 (projected)| 3.3 months          | ⚠️ Low     |
| FY2027   | $2,470,000         | $617,500     | $1,235,000   | $700,000 (goal)     | 3.4 months          | ⚠️ Low     |
| FY2028   | $3,250,000         | $812,500     | $1,625,000   | $1,000,000 (goal)   | 3.7 months          | ✅ OK      |

**Reserve Building Strategy**:
- Allocate 50% of annual surplus to reserves
- Launch "Legacy Fund" campaign (Year 7)—ask donors to contribute to reserves (less appealing than programs, but necessary)
- Unrestricted endowment distributions supplement reserves

---

### Contingency Budget

**"What-If" Budget Line Item**: 5% of operating budget set aside for unexpected expenses.

**FY2026 Contingency**: $90,000 (5% of $1.77M)

**Uses**:
- Revenue shortfall (grant denied, donor withdrew)
- Unexpected expense (lawsuit, equipment failure, staff turnover)
- Opportunity (last-minute conference, emergency patient need)

**If Unused**: Rolls into reserves at year-end (builds financial cushion).

---

## Conclusion

### Budget as Strategic Tool

**Bottom Line**: Budget isn't just numbers—it's Foundation's strategic plan translated into dollars. Every line item = mission priority, resource allocation decision, accountability commitment.

**Budget Excellence**: Participatory process (all departments contribute), realistic assumptions (no wishful thinking), disciplined execution (monitor variances, take corrective action).

**Continuous Improvement**: Learn from each budget cycle—refine forecasting methods, improve departmental engagement, strengthen Board understanding.
