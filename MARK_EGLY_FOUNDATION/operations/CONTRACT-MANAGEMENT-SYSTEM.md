## 1. Contract Management Philosophy

### Foundation's Approach to Contracts

**Contracts = Strategic Tools**: Every contract represents a relationship, obligation, or risk—not just paperwork. Well-managed contracts protect the Foundation legally, financially, and operationally while enabling mission delivery (vendor services, research partnerships, employment relationships).

**Lifecycle Mindset**: Contract management doesn't end at signature—it extends through performance monitoring, renewal decisions, amendments, and eventual termination or expiration. Poor tracking = missed renewals, auto-renewals at unfavorable terms, or service disruptions.

**Risk-Proportionate Rigor**: Not all contracts require attorney review (e.g., $50/month SaaS subscription = template sufficient), but high-value, complex, or novel agreements demand legal scrutiny. System balances efficiency with protection.

---

### Benefits of Structured Contract Management

**For Foundation**:

- ✅ **Legal Protection**: Enforceable terms, clear obligations, dispute resolution mechanisms (avoid "handshake deals" that fail in court)
- ✅ **Cost Control**: Track renewal dates, negotiate better terms, avoid auto-renewals at increased prices ($500-$5K saved annually by proactive renegotiation)
- ✅ **Operational Continuity**: Know when contracts expire, plan vendor transitions or extensions (no service interruptions—critical for REDCap hosting, Salesforce, payroll)
- ✅ **Compliance**: Ensure HIPAA BAAs, insurance requirements, indemnification, IP ownership terms present (avoid regulatory violations or IP disputes)
- ✅ **Accountability**: Clear owner for each contract (performance monitoring, relationship management, renewal decisions)

**For Partners/Vendors**:

- ✅ **Clarity**: Both parties know expectations, deliverables, payment terms (reduces disputes)
- ✅ **Professionalism**: Well-drafted contracts signal Foundation's maturity, seriousness (attracts better partners)

---

## 2. Types of Contracts

### Contract Categories (Foundation Context)

**1. Vendor/Service Agreements** (Most Common):

- **SaaS Subscriptions**: REDCap hosting, Salesforce, Google Workspace, 1Password, Zoom, Asana, Mailchimp (monthly/annual subscriptions)
- **Professional Services**: Legal counsel (retainer), CPA (accounting/audit), MSSP (cybersecurity), grant consultants, web developers
- **Office/Operations**: Office lease, insurance policies, janitorial service, internet/phone, utilities

**2. Employment & Contractor Agreements**:

- **Employment Offers**: Offer letters for staff (terms, salary, benefits, at-will or term)
- **Independent Contractors**: Grant writers, event planners, designers, consultants (1099 contracts with scope, deliverables, payment)
- **Volunteers**: Volunteer agreements (liability waiver, confidentiality, role expectations)
- **Interns**: Internship agreements (unpaid/paid, academic credit, learning objectives)

**3. Partnership & Collaboration Agreements**:

- **Research Collaborations**: Academic partnerships (data sharing, co-authorship, IRB coordination)
- **Corporate Sponsorships**: Pharma or biotech sponsors (funding, branding, restrictions)
- **Patient Organization MOUs**: Coalitions, joint campaigns (resource sharing, co-branding, roles)
- **Event Partnerships**: Co-hosted conferences, galas (revenue split, responsibilities)

**4. Real Property & Facilities**:

- **Office Lease**: Commercial lease for Foundation headquarters (term, rent, escalation, maintenance, early termination)
- **Storage**: Warehouse or offsite records storage (if physical archives)
- **Event Venues**: Venue contracts for annual gala, conferences (dates, capacity, cancellation terms)

**5. Intellectual Property Agreements**:

- **Trademark Licenses**: Use of "Mark Egly Foundation" name/logo by partners (restrictions, quality control)
- **Content Licenses**: Stock photos, music, software licenses (perpetual vs. subscription)
- **Researcher Agreements**: IP ownership for Foundation-funded research (grant-back rights, commercialization sharing)

**6. Grant & Funding Agreements**:

- **Grant Awards (Foundation = Grantee)**: NIH, foundations, corporate grants (terms, reporting, allowable costs, IP, close-out)
- **Sub-Awards (Foundation = Grantor)**: If Foundation makes grants to researchers (rare Year 1-3, common Year 5+)

**7. Data Use & Privacy Agreements**:

- **Data Use Agreements (DUAs)**: Sharing registry data with researchers (HIPAA-compliant, permitted uses, security, destruction)
- **Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)**: Vendors accessing PHI (HIPAA-required—REDCap host, Salesforce, email marketing if patient lists)
- **Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)**: Protect confidential info when discussing partnerships, sharing donor lists, or providing patient data for proposals

**8. Insurance Policies**:

- General liability, D&O, cyber insurance, workers' comp (technically policies = contracts with insurers—track renewals, coverage changes)

---

## 3. Contract Lifecycle Overview

### Seven Stages of Contract Lifecycle

**Stage 1: Request & Need Identification**:

- Trigger: Business need arises (need CPA for audit, need grant writer, need new SaaS tool)
- Owner: Department lead (COO, ED, Research Coordinator) identifies need, proposes vendor/partner

**Stage 2: Drafting & Negotiation**:

- Use template (if available—vendor agreement, employment offer) or custom draft (legal counsel for complex)
- Negotiate terms (price, deliverables, liability, termination, IP, dispute resolution)
- Redline iterations (track versions—"v1 Foundation draft," "v2 Vendor markup," "v3 Final")

**Stage 3: Review & Approval**:

- Legal review (if high-value or complex—threshold: >$10K/year or novel terms)
- Financial review (COO/CFO—budget impact, payment terms)
- ED approval (final sign-off per signature authority matrix—see Section 6)

**Stage 4: Execution**:

- Both parties sign (electronic via DocuSign or manual ink signatures)
- Fully executed copy distributed to both parties
- Store in contract repository (Google Drive or contract management software)

**Stage 5: Performance & Monitoring**:

- Track deliverables, milestones, payments (COO or contract owner monitors—vendor delivering on time? quality acceptable?)
- Address performance issues (written notice if vendor breaches, cure period, escalate to termination if not remedied)

**Stage 6: Renewal or Expiration**:

- Review contract 90-120 days before expiration (continue? renegotiate? switch vendors?)
- If renew: Initiate renewal process (may require amended contract or simple renewal notice)
- If terminate: Follow termination procedures (notice period, data return, transition to new vendor)

**Stage 7: Close-Out & Archive**:

- Final payment, final deliverables received
- Archive executed contract + amendments (retain 7 years per records retention policy)
- Document lessons learned (vendor performance, contract terms that worked or didn't—inform future contracts)

---

## 4. Contract Templates & Standardization

### Why Templates Matter

**Efficiency**: Don't reinvent wheel—standard vendor agreement template saves 5-10 hours attorney time per contract ($1K-$2K savings)

**Consistency**: Same core terms across similar contracts (liability caps, indemnification, governing law—reduces confusion, easier to compare)

**Risk Mitigation**: Pre-vetted terms protect Foundation (attorney drafted template includes favorable clauses—vendor can propose changes but starting point strong)

---

### Foundation's Template Library

**Tier 1: Standard Templates** (Attorney-Drafted, Reusable):

- [ ] **Vendor Services Agreement** (professional services—consultants, contractors; includes scope, payment, IP ownership, confidentiality, termination)
- [ ] **SaaS Subscription Agreement** (standard for cloud software—license grant, data ownership, BAA if PHI, auto-renewal, termination)
- [ ] **Employment Offer Letter** (at-will employment—position, salary, benefits, start date, contingencies like background check)
- [ ] **Independent Contractor Agreement** (1099 contractors—scope, deliverables, payment schedule, IP assignment, no employment relationship)
- [ ] **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)** (mutual or one-way—confidential info definition, permitted uses, term, exceptions)
- [ ] **Volunteer Agreement** (role expectations, confidentiality, liability waiver, at-will termination)
- [ ] **Data Use Agreement (DUA)** (HIPAA-compliant—permitted uses, security, no re-identification, destruction, breach notification)
- [ ] **Business Associate Agreement (BAA)** (HIPAA-required for vendors—security, breach notification, subcontractor flow-down, audit rights)

**Tier 2: Custom Contracts** (Attorney-Drafted, Unique):

- Research Collaboration Agreements (academic partnerships—complex IP, data sharing, publication rights, funding allocation)
- Corporate Sponsorship Agreements (multi-year, high-value—$50K+, branding, exclusivity, performance metrics)
- Office Lease (commercial real estate—negotiate with landlord's form, attorney reviews)
- Grant Award Agreements (from funders—negotiate allowable costs, IP, reporting, close-out terms)

**Tier 3: Vendor Paper** (Counterparty Provides):

- Insurance policies (insurer's form—Foundation reviews coverage, limits, exclusions but doesn't draft)
- SaaS Terms of Service (Salesforce, Google Workspace—"click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements; Foundation negotiates BAA as amendment)
- Event Venues (venue's standard contract—Foundation negotiates cancellation, force majeure, liability)

---

### Template Usage Guidelines

**When to Use Template**:

- ✅ Routine transaction (hiring consultant, subscribing to SaaS, engaging vendor for standard service)
- ✅ Low dollar value (<$10K/year—risk-proportionate)
- ✅ No novel legal issues (straightforward services, no complex IP or liability questions)

**When to Customize / Attorney Review**:

- ❌ High value (>$10K/year or >$25K total contract value)
- ❌ Novel terms (first-time contract type—e.g., first biobank partnership, first international collaboration)
- ❌ High risk (involves PHI, patient safety, significant liability exposure, IP ownership disputes)
- ❌ Long-term commitment (multi-year, auto-renewal with penalties for early termination)

**Process**: COO starts with template → fills in blanks (parties, scope, price, term) → sends to legal counsel if customization or high-value → negotiate with counterparty → finalize

---

## 5. Review & Approval Workflows

### Standard Workflow (Most Contracts)

**Step 1: Business Owner Initiates**:

- Department lead (COO, ED, Research Coordinator) identifies need (e.g., need CPA for Year 2 audit)
- Drafts contract using template or obtains vendor's proposed contract
- Completes Contract Request Form (Google Form—contract type, counterparty, value, term, business justification)

**Step 2: Legal Review** (If Required—see thresholds):

- COO forwards draft to legal counsel (external attorney on retainer or pro bono counsel)
- Attorney reviews for legal risks (liability, indemnification, IP, compliance—HIPAA BAA present if PHI?, insurance adequate?)
- Attorney provides redlines or approval memo (2-5 business days turnaround)

**Step 3: Financial Review** (COO or CFO—Year 1 COO = CFO):

- Verify budget availability (contract cost fits within approved budget line item?)
- Review payment terms (upfront? installments? milestone-based? Foundation cash flow adequate?)
- Approve or flag concerns (if over budget, escalate to ED or defer to next fiscal year)

**Step 4: ED Approval** (Per Signature Authority—see Section 6):

- ED reviews business case, legal/financial sign-offs
- Approves or denies (denial reasons: over budget, strategic misalignment, legal risk too high)
- If approved, ED authorizes signature (ED signs or delegates to COO if within COO authority)

**Step 5: Execution**:

- Send to counterparty for signature (DocuSign or email PDF)
- Once both parties sign, distribute fully executed copy to: contract owner, COO, legal counsel (if reviewed)
- Upload to contract repository (Google Drive folder: "Contracts - Executed")

---

### Expedited Workflow (Low-Value, Low-Risk)

**Thresholds**:

- <$5K total contract value
- Standard template used (no attorney review)
- No PHI, IP, or liability concerns

**Process**:

- Business owner drafts using template
- COO reviews and approves (same-day or 24-hour turnaround)
- COO signs (per signature authority) or escalates to ED if needed
- Execute and file

**Example**: Subscribing to Zoom Pro ($15/month, $180/year) = expedited (use vendor's terms, COO approves, COO signs via click-wrap or PO)

---

## 6. Signature Authority Matrix

### Who Can Sign What?

**Purpose**: Prevent unauthorized commitments (staff can't sign $100K contract without approval), ensure appropriate oversight (Board approval for major commitments), enable operational efficiency (don't bottleneck ED for every $500 purchase)

---

### Authority Levels

| **Signatory**          | **Authority Limit**                               | **Contract Types**                                                     | **Board Pre-Approval Required?**        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Executive Director** | Up to $50K/year; $100K total contract value       | All contracts within budget                                            | No (unless >$100K or multi-year >$200K) |
| **COO**                | Up to $10K/year; $25K total                       | Vendor agreements, SaaS, consultants, employment offers (<$75K salary) | No                                      |
| **Department Heads**   | Up to $2K/year                                    | Routine vendor services, supplies                                      | No (with COO pre-approval)              |
| **Board Chair**        | Unlimited (with Board vote)                       | Real estate, debt, major grants, ED employment contract                | Yes (Board vote required)               |
| **Board Treasurer**    | Co-signature required for $50K-$100K ED contracts | Financial contracts, loans                                             | Yes (Board vote)                        |

---

### Special Cases

**Real Estate** (Office Lease, Purchase):

- Board approval required (vote at Board meeting—majority or supermajority per bylaws)
- ED + Board Chair co-sign

**Debt / Loans**:

- Board approval required (borrowing >$25K—line of credit, mortgage, bonds)
- ED + Board Treasurer co-sign

**Multi-Year Commitments** (>3 years or >$200K total):

- Board approval required (long-term obligation binds future Boards—governance prudence)
- ED signs after Board vote

**Grant Awards to Foundation** (Foundation = Grantee):

- ED signature sufficient (accepting funds = operational decision, not Board-level unless funder requires Board resolution)
- Inform Board at next meeting (transparency—"We received $100K NIH grant")

**ED Employment Contract**:

- Board approval required (Board hires ED, negotiates compensation)
- Board Chair signs on behalf of Foundation

---

### Delegation

**ED May Delegate** (in writing):

- COO signature authority up to COO's limit ($10K/year)—e.g., "COO authorized to sign vendor contracts <$10K/year on my behalf"
- Temporary delegation if ED unavailable (travel, medical leave—"COO serves as Acting ED with full signature authority for 2 weeks")

**COO May Not Delegate**: Department heads can't sign contracts without COO explicit authorization

---

## 7. Execution & Counterparty Management

### Execution Methods

**Electronic Signature** (Preferred Year 1+):

- **Platform**: DocuSign ($10-$25/month per user—Foundation Business plan)
- **Process**: Upload PDF → add signature fields → send to counterparty email → both parties sign electronically → auto-distribute fully executed PDF
- **Legal Validity**: ESIGN Act (federal) and UETA (state laws) make e-signatures legally binding = equivalent to ink signatures
- **Benefits**: Fast (24-48 hour turnaround vs. 1-2 weeks mail), audit trail (timestamp, IP address, email confirmation), searchable (all contracts in DocuSign repository)

**Wet Ink Signature** (Rare—if counterparty requires or high-formality contracts):

- Print 2 copies → both parties sign → mail/scan exchange → store original in fireproof filing cabinet

---

### Counterparty Management

**Vendor Onboarding Checklist** (Before Contract Execution):

- [ ] Verify legal entity name (W-9 form—correct name for 1099 if contractor, correct name for ACH payment)
- [ ] Obtain certificate of insurance (if contractor working on-site or handling Foundation assets—general liability $1M, workers' comp if employees, auto if driving)
- [ ] Request W-9 (for 1099 reporting if contractor or vendor paid >$600/year)
- [ ] Background check (if vendor has access to PHI or vulnerable populations—patient navigators, volunteers with patient contact)
- [ ] Conflict of interest disclosure (Board members, key staff—any financial interest in vendor? related party transaction disclosure)

**Vendor Repository** (Salesforce or Google Sheet):

- Vendor name, contact, W-9 on file, insurance expiration, contract start/end dates, annual spend, performance notes

---

## 8. Contract Repository & Storage

### Where Contracts Live

**Centralized Repository** (Google Drive—Year 1-2):

- **Folder Structure**:
  ```
  Contracts/
    ├── Templates/
    │   ├── Vendor-Agreement-Template.docx
    │   ├── Employment-Offer-Letter.docx
    │   ├── BAA-Template.docx

    ├── In Progress/ (drafts, under negotiation)
    └── Expired/ (archive—retain 7 years)
  ```

**Access Control**:

- **View Access**: All staff (transparency—employees can review vendor contracts, partnership agreements)
- **Edit Access**: COO + ED only (prevent accidental deletion or modification)
- **Execution Folder**: Read-only after execution (signed contracts locked—can't edit)

**Naming Convention**: `YYYY-MM-DD-Counterparty-Contract-Type.pdf` (e.g., `2025-01-15-Salesforce-BAA.pdf`)—sortable by date, searchable by vendor

---

### Contract Management Software (Year 3+)

**Why Upgrade from Google Drive**:

- Automated renewal reminders (90, 60, 30 days before expiration—email to contract owner)
- Searchable metadata (filter by contract type, value, expiration date, vendor, owner)
- Version control (track redlines, amendments, who changed what when)
- Reporting (total contract spend by category, expiring contracts next quarter, vendor performance scores)

**Recommended Tools**:

- **ContractWorks** ($500-$1,200/year for <500 contracts—small nonprofit tier)
- **PandaDoc** ($19-$49/user/month—includes e-signature, templates, workflow automation)
- **Airtable + Zapier** (DIY option—$20/month Airtable + $30/month Zapier—integrate with Google Drive, auto-create renewal tasks in Asana)

---

## 9. Renewal & Expiration Tracking

### Why Renewal Tracking Matters

**Risk of Missed Renewals**:

- Service interruption (REDCap hosting expires → registry offline, research halts—$10K-$50K project disruption)
- Auto-renewal at unfavorable terms (SaaS vendor auto-renews at 20% price increase because Foundation missed 60-day cancellation window—pay $2K more annually or breach contract to cancel)
- Lapsed insurance (workers' comp policy not renewed → employee injured, Foundation pays out-of-pocket $50K-$500K medical + potential OSHA fines)

---

### Renewal Process

**Timeline** (Standard):

- **T-120 days**: COO reviews upcoming expirations (quarterly scan—contracts expiring in next 90 days)
- **T-90 days**: Contract owner (department lead) evaluates: Renew? Renegotiate? Switch vendors? Let expire?
- **T-60 days**: If renew, initiate renewal process (vendor outreach, price negotiation, draft renewal amendment or new contract if major changes)
- **T-30 days**: Execute renewal agreement (before auto-renewal deadline if applicable—many SaaS contracts require 30-60 day cancellation notice)
- **T-0 (Expiration)**: New term begins seamlessly (or contract terminates if decided not to renew)

---

### Renewal Decision Matrix

**Renew (No Changes)**:

- ✅ Vendor performance excellent (deliverables met, responsive, quality high)
- ✅ Price competitive (market research shows comparable or better than alternatives)
- ✅ No strategic changes (Foundation still needs service—e.g., still need CPA, still need REDCap)

**Renew (Renegotiate Terms)**:

- ⚠️ Price increased significantly (vendor proposes 20% increase—negotiate down to 5-10% or threaten to switch)
- ⚠️ Scope changed (Foundation needs more/less—REDCap users increased from 5 to 15, need volume discount)
- ⚠️ Vendor performance issues (missed deadlines, quality declined—renegotiate SLA, penalties, or exit)

**Do Not Renew (Switch Vendors or Eliminate Service)**:

- ❌ Vendor breach (significant performance failure, security breach, HIPAA violation—terminate for cause)
- ❌ Better alternative (competitor offers superior service, lower price, better features—e.g., migrate Salesforce to HubSpot if saves $5K/year)
- ❌ No longer needed (Foundation pivots strategy—eliminate patient navigation program, don't need patient navigator job posting service)

---

### Renewal Reminder System

**Manual (Year 1-2)**:

- Google Calendar: Create calendar event for each contract expiration (set 120, 90, 60, 30-day reminders)
- Monthly COO report: "Contracts expiring next 90 days" (distribute to ED, department heads)

**Automated (Year 3+—Contract Management Software)**:

- Email alerts to contract owner + COO (90, 60, 30 days before expiration)
- Dashboard: Red = expires <30 days, Yellow = expires 30-90 days, Green = >90 days
- Asana task auto-creation: "Review Salesforce BAA renewal—expires in 90 days" assigned to COO

---

## 10. Amendment & Modification Procedures

### When Amendments Required

**Contract Changes During Term**:

- **Scope Change**: Add deliverables, increase/decrease service level (e.g., hire grant writer for 2 more grants/year—amend to increase scope and fee)
- **Price Adjustment**: Mid-term price change (inflation adjustment, volume discount retroactively applied)
- **Term Extension**: Extend expiration date (pilot project successful, extend 6 months while negotiate full contract renewal)
- **Party Change**: Vendor acquired by another company (successor-in-interest clause—new entity assumes contract)

---

### Amendment Process

**Step 1: Mutual Agreement**:

- Both parties agree change needed (email exchange, meeting notes documenting intent)
- Draft amendment (use "Amendment No. 1 to [Contract Name]" template)

**Step 2: Amendment Document**:

- **Recitals**: Reference original contract ("WHEREAS, parties entered into Vendor Services Agreement dated January 1, 2024...")
- **Amendments**: Specific changes ("Section 3.1 'Scope of Work' is amended to add: '...additional 5 grants per year...'")
- **Unchanged Terms**: "All other terms remain in full force and effect"
- **Signatures**: Both parties sign (same authority level as original contract—if ED signed original, ED signs amendment)

**Step 3: Execute & File**:

- Both parties sign amendment
- Attach amendment to original contract in repository (Google Drive—save as `2024-01-01-Vendor-Agreement-Amendment-1.pdf` in same folder as original)
- Update contract summary sheet (reflect new scope, price, expiration date)

**Best Practice**: Never modify original contract via email or verbal agreement—always formal written amendment (protects both parties, avoids "he said / she said" disputes)

---

## 11. Termination & Exit Procedures

### Termination Scenarios

**1. Term Expiration** (Natural End):

- Contract reaches end of term (12-month agreement ends December 31, 2025—no renewal)
- Process: No action required (contract terminates automatically unless renewal clause states auto-renew)

**2. Termination for Convenience** (Either Party Can Exit):

- Many contracts include clause: "Either party may terminate upon 30/60/90 days written notice"
- Foundation decides to terminate (vendor performance adequate but switching to cheaper alternative, or eliminating service)
- Process: Send written termination notice (email + certified mail—specify termination date 30+ days out), pay through termination date, return vendor property if any

**3. Termination for Cause** (Breach):

- Vendor breaches material term (misses critical deadline, fails to deliver, breaches confidentiality, HIPAA violation)
- Foundation sends "Notice of Breach" (written—specify breach, demand cure within 15-30 days per contract cure period)
- If not cured, Foundation sends "Notice of Termination for Cause" (effective immediately or per contract notice period)
- No further payment due (unless contract specifies payment for work completed to date—pro-rated)

**4. Mutual Termination**:

- Both parties agree relationship not working (vendor can't deliver, Foundation can't pay, strategic misalignment)
- Negotiate termination agreement (settlement—Foundation may owe partial payment, vendor may waive fees, mutual release of claims)

---

### Exit Checklist

**Before Termination Effective Date**:

- [ ] Identify replacement vendor (if applicable—don't terminate REDCap hosting until new host ready)
- [ ] Data migration (export data, transfer to Foundation or new vendor—e.g., Salesforce data export before canceling)
- [ ] Vendor property return (laptops, access badges, keys if vendor had on-site access)
- [ ] Foundation property return (prepaid fees, equipment Foundation loaned to vendor)
- [ ] Access revocation (revoke vendor's access to Foundation systems—email, VPN, databases)
- [ ] Final invoice reconciliation (pay outstanding invoices, close out account, zero balance)
- [ ] Confirm data destruction (vendor must delete Foundation data per contract—written certification required)

**Post-Termination**:

- [ ] Archive contract + termination notice (Google Drive Expired folder—retain 7 years)
- [ ] Update vendor repository (mark "Terminated," end date, reason, performance notes—inform future decisions if consider re-engaging)
- [ ] Lessons learned (COO documents what worked, what didn't—avoid repeating mistakes with next vendor)

---

## 12. Vendor & Partner Risk Assessment

### Pre-Contract Risk Evaluation

**Purpose**: Assess vendor/partner before signing contract—financial stability, reputation, security, compliance—avoid contracting with risky entities that could harm Foundation (data breach, financial failure, reputational association)

---

### Risk Assessment Checklist

**Financial Stability** (For High-Value or Critical Vendors—>$25K/year or mission-critical like REDCap):

- [ ] Request financial statements or D&B report (if vendor publicly traded, review 10-K; if private, request overview or rely on reputation)
- [ ] Check Better Business Bureau (BBB rating—A+ to F, complaint history)
- [ ] Google search for lawsuits, bankruptcies, scandals

**Cybersecurity & Compliance** (For Vendors Accessing PHI or Foundation Systems):

- [ ] Request SOC 2 Type II report (security controls audit—if vendor stores Foundation data, especially PHI)
- [ ] Verify HIPAA compliance (if vendor = Business Associate, must have security program, willing to sign BAA)
- [ ] Check for prior breaches (Google "[Vendor Name] data breach"—if history of breaches, reconsider or demand stronger contractual protections)

**Insurance Coverage** (For Service Vendors—Consultants, Contractors, Event Vendors):

- [ ] General liability insurance ≥$1M (protects Foundation if vendor causes injury/damage—e.g., event caterer causes food poisoning)
- [ ] Professional liability (E&O) ≥$1M (if consultant—CPA, attorney, grant writer—malpractice insurance)
- [ ] Cyber liability ≥$1M (if vendor handles PHI or sensitive data—covers breach notification, remediation)
- [ ] Workers' comp (if vendor has employees—required by law, protects Foundation from employee injury claims)

**Reputation & References** (For New or Unknown Vendors):

- [ ] Request 3 references (contact similar nonprofits or clients—ask about vendor performance, reliability, challenges)
- [ ] Check online reviews (Google, Yelp, Trustpilot—overall sentiment positive?)
- [ ] Social media scan (vendor's LinkedIn, Twitter—professional? red flags like controversial posts, spam?)

---

### Risk Scoring

**Low Risk** (Expedited Contracting):

- Established vendor (national brand—Google, Salesforce, Verizon)
- Low dollar value (<$5K/year)
- No PHI access
- Standard service (office supplies, software subscription)

**Medium Risk** (Standard Contracting + Light Due Diligence):

- Regional vendor or small business
- Medium dollar value ($5K-$25K/year)
- Limited PHI or sensitive data access
- Professional services (consultant, grant writer)

**High Risk** (Rigorous Due Diligence + Legal Review\*\*:

- Unknown vendor or startup
- High dollar value (>$25K/year or >$50K total)
- Extensive PHI access (REDCap host, biobank partner, research collaborator)
- Novel or complex services (first-of-type partnership, international collaboration)

---

## 13. Compliance & Audit Trail

### Contract Compliance Monitoring

**Performance Metrics** (Track Vendor Delivery):

- Deliverables completed on time? (e.g., grant writer submitted 12 grants as contracted? CPA completed audit by deadline?)
- Quality acceptable? (work product meets standards—no errors requiring rework?)
- Budget adherence? (invoices match contracted rates? no surprise charges?)

**Reporting**: COO maintains Vendor Performance Scorecard (Google Sheet—quarterly update):
| Vendor | Contract Value | Deliverables Met (%) | Quality (1-5) | On-Time (%) | Notes |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| CPA Firm | $10K | 100% | 5 | 100% | Excellent—audit completed early |
| Grant Writer | $15K | 80% | 3 | 60% | Missed 2 deadlines, quality mixed—consider non-renewal |

### Audit Trail Requirements

**What to Document**:

- Contract request (business justification, approval chain—email thread or Contract Request Form)
- Legal review (attorney memo or redline—if legal involved)
- Financial approval (COO/CFO email: "Approved—$10K in professional services budget")
- Execution (signed contract, DocuSign audit trail—timestamp, IP, email)
- Amendments (all amendments executed and filed with original)
- Performance notes (meeting minutes, email exchange re: deliverables, quality)
- Termination notice (if terminated—written notice, vendor acknowledgment)

**Retention**: 7 years post-contract expiration (standard business records retention—aligns with IRS audit period, statute of limitations for contract disputes)

---

### Internal Audit (Annual)

**COO Conducts** (January—after fiscal year-end):

- Review all contracts executed in prior year (any missing from repository? unauthorized contracts signed?)
- Verify signature authority followed (no unauthorized signatures—staff signing contracts beyond authority?)
- Check renewals (were expiring contracts reviewed timely? any auto-renewals at unfavorable terms?)
- Vendor performance review (any consistently underperforming vendors? recommend non-renewal or replacement?)

**Report to ED & Board**: "Contract Management Annual Report" (summary: # contracts, total spend, high-value contracts, risks identified, recommendations)

---

## 14. Tools & Technology

### Year 1-2: Google Drive + DocuSign + Spreadsheet

**Setup**:

- Google Drive folder structure (see Section 8—Executed, In Progress, Expired)
- DocuSign account ($25/month—single user COO, or $10/month if nonprofit discount)
- Google Sheets: Contract Tracker (columns: Contract Name, Vendor, Type, Start Date, End Date, Value, Owner, Status, Renewal Date, Notes)

**Workflow**:

- COO maintains tracker (monthly update—add new contracts, update statuses, flag upcoming renewals)
- DocuSign emails auto-stored in Google Drive (forward completed DocuSign envelopes to contracts@foundation.org → auto-save to Drive via Gmail filter + script)

**Cost**: $300-$500/year (DocuSign + minimal IT time to configure)

---

### Year 3+: Contract Management Software

**Recommended Tools**:

**ContractWorks** ($500-$1,200/year):

- Features: Central repository, automated renewal alerts (email), searchable metadata (tags, custom fields), version control, user permissions
- Pros: Nonprofit pricing, easy onboarding (2-4 hours setup), no per-user fees
- Cons: Basic reporting (no advanced analytics—can't auto-generate spend dashboards without export to Excel)

**PandaDoc** ($19-$49/user/month = $228-$588/year for 1 user):

- Features: Contract templates, e-signature, workflow automation (send for legal review → CFO approval → ED signature), CRM integration (Salesforce)
- Pros: All-in-one (templates + execution + storage), robust analytics (contract cycle time, approval bottlenecks)
- Cons: Higher cost if multiple users

**Airtable + Zapier** (DIY—$20/month Airtable + $30/month Zapier = $600/year):

- Features: Custom contract database (Airtable base with views, filters, linked records), automated workflows (Zapier—new contract in Airtable → create Asana renewal task 90 days before expiration → email COO)
- Pros: Flexible, integrates with existing tools (Google Drive, Asana, Gmail), lower cost
- Cons: Requires setup time (10-20 hours to build base + automation), less user-friendly for non-technical staff

---

### Selection Criteria

**Choose Based On**:

- **Number of Contracts**: <50/year = Google Drive adequate; 50-200/year = ContractWorks or PandaDoc; >200/year = enterprise tool (Concord, DocuSign CLM—$5K-$10K+/year)
- **Budget**: <$500/year = DIY; $500-$2K/year = ContractWorks or PandaDoc; >$2K/year = enterprise
- **Technical Capacity**: Staff comfortable with Airtable/Zapier = DIY; prefer turnkey = ContractWorks

## Conclusion: Contracts = Foundation of Trust

**Contract management is risk management**: Every contract represents a promise—to a vendor, partner, employee, or funder. Broken promises erode trust, waste money, and expose Foundation to legal liability. A robust contract management system ensures Foundation honors commitments, protects interests, and builds reputation as reliable, professional partner.

**Foundation's Contract Management Maturity Path**:

- **Year 1**: Establish basics (templates, repository, signature authority, COO ownership, manual tracking)
- **Year 2**: Refine processes (legal counsel retainer, vendor risk assessment, performance monitoring, renewal discipline)
- **Year 3+**: Scale & automate (contract management software, advanced reporting, predictive analytics—"Which vendors underperform? Where do we overspend?")

**ROI of Contract Management**:

- **Cost Savings**: $5K-$20K/year (renegotiated renewals, avoided auto-renewals, eliminated redundant vendors)
- **Risk Mitigation**: $50K-$500K+ (avoided data breaches, service disruptions, litigation from breached contracts)
- **Time Savings**: 50-100 hours/year COO time (automation, templates, centralized repository—vs. ad hoc scrambling to find contracts, negotiate from scratch)

**"A well-managed contract protects what matters: the Foundation's mission, reputation, finances, and relationships. Neglected contracts become landmines—waiting to detonate at the worst time."**
