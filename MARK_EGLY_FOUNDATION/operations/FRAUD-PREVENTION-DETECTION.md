## Fraud Prevention Philosophy

### Foundation's Zero-Tolerance Approach

**Core Principle**: Every dollar donated to Mark Egly Foundation is sacred—entrusted by donors to serve AATD patients. Fraud betrays that trust and will not be tolerated.

**Three-Layer Defense**:
1. **Prevention**: Strong controls make fraud difficult (segregation of duties, approvals, monitoring)
2. **Detection**: Regular audits and monitoring catch fraud early (internal reviews, hotline, data analytics)
3. **Response**: Swift investigation and action when fraud suspected (investigation, termination, prosecution, recovery)

---

### Common Nonprofit Fraud Schemes

**Embezzlement** (Most Common):
- Employee writes checks to self or fictitious vendors
- Employee uses Foundation credit card for personal expenses
- Employee creates fake employees on payroll, pockets paychecks
- **Average Loss**: $100,000-$500,000 before detection

**Grant Fraud**:
- Falsifying grant applications (inflated numbers, fake partnerships)
- Misusing restricted grant funds (using for unallowed expenses)
- Double-dipping (billing same expense to multiple grants)
- **Average Loss**: $50,000-$200,000, plus grant repayment + penalties

**Expense Reimbursement Fraud**:
- Submitting fake receipts
- Inflating mileage or meal expenses
- Claiming personal expenses as business
- **Average Loss**: $10,000-$50,000

**Theft of Donations**:
- Event staff pocketing cash donations
- Development staff diverting donor checks to personal accounts
- Online donation platform access abused
- **Average Loss**: $5,000-$100,000

---

## Financial Controls Framework

### The Fraud Triangle (Understanding Fraud Drivers)

**Fraud Occurs When Three Elements Present**:

1. **Opportunity**: Weak controls allow fraud (no oversight, single person controls money)
2. **Pressure**: Employee has financial need (debt, medical bills, lifestyle)
3. **Rationalization**: Employee justifies fraud ("I deserve this," "I'll pay it back," "Foundation won't miss it")

**Foundation's Control Strategy**: Eliminate opportunity (can't control employee's pressure or rationalization, but can remove opportunity through controls).

---

### Key Financial Controls

**Control 1: Dual Signature Requirement**
- **Rule**: All checks >$5,000 require two signatures
- **Signers**: Executive Director, Board Treasurer, COO (any 2 of 3)
- **Why**: Prevents single person from writing large check without oversight

**Control 2: Bank Account Restrictions**
- **Rule**: Only authorized signers have bank access
- **Online Banking**: Two-factor authentication required, single-user transaction limits ($10K)
- **Bank Alerts**: Treasurer receives email alert for all transactions >$5,000

**Control 3: Credit Card Controls**
- **Rule**: Foundation credit cards issued only to ED, COO, Development Director (3 cards max)
- **Limits**: $5,000/month per card
- **Receipts**: All expenses require itemized receipt within 7 days
- **Monthly Review**: Treasurer reviews all credit card statements, flags questionable expenses

**Control 4: Cash Handling**
- **Rule**: Two people count cash (events, donations)
- **Deposits**: Cash deposited within 24 hours, deposit slip signed by both counters
- **Petty Cash**: $500 max, locked, reconciled monthly

**Control 5: Vendor Management**
- **Rule**: All new vendors require W-9 and vendor setup approval (COO or ED)
- **Verification**: Before first payment, verify vendor is real (Google search, phone call, website check)
- **Suspicious Vendors**: Flag vendors with P.O. box addresses, Gmail emails, misspelled names

## Segregation of Duties

### Critical Segregation Matrix

**Principle**: Same person should never control all aspects of a transaction (authorization, execution, recording, reconciliation).

| **Function**                  | **Who Authorizes**     | **Who Executes**        | **Who Records**          | **Who Reconciles**     |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Expense Payments**          | ED or COO              | Accountant (cuts check) | Accountant (enters QB)   | Treasurer (monthly)    |
| **Payroll**                   | ED (approves timesheets) | Payroll vendor (ADP)   | Accountant (enters QB)   | COO (quarterly audit)  |
| **Grant Applications**        | ED (signs)             | Development Dir (writes)| Grant Manager (tracks)   | ED (reviews reports)   |
| **Donor Receipts**            | Development Dir        | Database Mgr (enters)   | Accountant (deposits)    | ED (monthly reports)   |
| **Credit Card Charges**       | Cardholder (purchases) | Cardholder              | Accountant (reconciles)  | Treasurer (reviews)    |
| **Bank Reconciliations**      | N/A                    | Accountant              | Accountant (records)     | Treasurer or ED (signs)|

**Red Flag**: If one person performs 2+ functions in same row, fraud risk is HIGH—restructure immediately.

---

### Small Nonprofit Challenge (Year 1-2: Only 5-10 Staff)

**Problem**: Hard to segregate duties when only 3-4 people touch finances (ED, COO, Accountant).

**Solutions**:
1. **Outsource Key Functions**: Use external bookkeeper/accountant (creates natural segregation)
2. **Board Oversight**: Treasurer reviews all bank statements monthly (independent check)
3. **Surprise Audits**: External auditor conducts surprise cash counts, transaction tests
4. **Technology Controls**: Use accounting software with user permissions (ED can approve, Accountant can pay, neither can do both)

---

## Approval Hierarchies & Spending Limits

### Spending Authority Matrix

| **Amount**       | **Authorization Required**        | **Documentation**                          | **Timeline**       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| **<$500**        | Department head (self-approval)   | Receipt, business purpose                  | Immediate          |
| **$500-$5,000**  | Executive Director                | Receipt, written justification, quote      | 24 hours           |
| **$5,000-$25K**  | ED + Board Treasurer              | 2 quotes, contract, Board memo             | 48 hours           |
| **$25K-$100K**   | Board Finance Committee           | 3 bids, contract review, ROI analysis      | 1 week             |
| **>$100K**       | Full Board vote                   | Full proposal, due diligence, legal review | Board meeting      |

**Emergency Exceptions**: ED can authorize up to $25K in emergencies (natural disaster, legal deadline) with Board Chair approval, ratified at next Board meeting.

---

### Purchase Order System (Year 3+)

**Process**:
1. **Requisition**: Staff requests purchase (online form)
2. **Approval**: Supervisor approves based on authority matrix
3. **PO Issued**: Accounting issues numbered Purchase Order to vendor
4. **Receipt**: Staff receives goods/services, signs receiving report
5. **Invoice Match**: Accounting matches invoice to PO and receiving report (three-way match)
6. **Payment**: Check issued only if all three documents match

**Why**: Prevents unauthorized purchases, fake invoices, overpayment fraud.

---

## Whistleblower Hotline & Reporting

### Anonymous Reporting Mechanisms

**Whistleblower Hotline** (Year 2+, once 15+ employees):
- **Vendor**: EthicsPoint, Lighthouse Services, Navex Global ($2,000-$5,000/year)
- **Access**: 24/7 phone hotline, web portal, text/email options
- **Anonymity**: Third-party receives reports, forwards to Foundation (reporter identity protected)
- **Languages**: English, Spanish (if serving Hispanic AATD patients)

**What Can Be Reported**:
- Financial misconduct (fraud, embezzlement, expense abuse)
- Grant fraud (misuse of funds, false reporting)
- Conflicts of interest (undisclosed relationships)
- Discrimination, harassment (HR violations)
- Patient safety concerns
- Retaliation against whistleblowers

---

### Whistleblower Protection Policy

**Legal Protection** (Federal + State Laws):
- **Whistleblower Protection Act**: Protects employees who report fraud to government
- **Sarbanes-Oxley Act**: Applies to nonprofits—prohibits retaliation against whistleblowers
- **IRS Form 990 Requirement**: 501(c)(3)s must have whistleblower policy

**Foundation's Policy**:
- ✅ No retaliation for good-faith reports (even if allegation proven unfounded)
- ✅ Confidentiality maintained to extent possible
- ✅ Anonymous reports investigated same as named reports
- ✅ Retaliation itself is terminable offense

**Board Oversight**: Ethics Committee (or Audit Committee) receives all whistleblower reports, ensures investigation, reviews outcomes.

---

### Confidential Reporting Alternatives (Year 1, Before Hotline)

**Options**:
1. **Board Chair Direct Contact**: Chair's email/phone published internally ("Report concerns directly to Board Chair")
2. **External Attorney**: Foundation's employment attorney accepts reports
3. **Suggestion Box**: Locked box in office, key held by Board Treasurer only
4. **Anonymous Email**: Ethics@MarkeGlyFoundation.org (monitored by Board Chair or external counsel)

---

## Expense Auditing Procedures

### Monthly Expense Review

**Who**: Board Treasurer + Executive Director (or COO if ED is incapacitated)
**When**: Within 10 days of month-end
**What**: Review 100% of expenses >$1,000, sample 10% of expenses <$1,000

**Red Flags to Look For**:
- Round numbers ($500.00, $1,000.00)—may indicate estimates or fake expenses
- Expenses just under approval threshold ($4,999 when threshold is $5,000)—avoiding oversight
- Unusual vendors (personal names, P.O. boxes, unfamiliar companies)
- Duplicate expenses (same amount, same vendor, short time apart)
- Frequent "lost receipt" claims by same employee
- Credit card charges at unusual locations (retail stores, restaurants during work hours)
- Mileage reimbursements exceeding IRS rate or unrealistic distances

**Action**: If red flag identified, Treasurer requests explanation from employee. If unsatisfactory, escalate to Audit Committee for investigation.

---

### Quarterly Trend Analysis

**Accountant Prepares** (for Treasurer review):
- Expense trends by category (are travel expenses up 50%? Why?)
- Vendor analysis (top 20 vendors—any surprises?)
- Employee expense reports (who submits most? any outliers?)
- Credit card usage patterns (any unusual spending spikes?)

**Board Report**: Treasurer presents quarterly financial dashboard to Board, highlighting anomalies.

---

## Grant Fraud Monitoring

### Grant Compliance Controls

**Control 1: Restricted Fund Accounting**
- Each grant = separate fund in QuickBooks (or accounting software)
- Expenses charged to grant must have documentation showing allowability
- Monthly review: Grant Manager reconciles spending to grant budget

**Control 2: Time & Effort Reporting**
- Staff working on grants submit monthly time sheets (% effort on each grant)
- Payroll allocated across grants based on actual time (not estimates)
- Personnel costs are 60-80% of grant expenses—most common fraud area

**Control 3: Subrecipient Monitoring**
- If Foundation subgrants to other orgs, monitor their compliance (require financial reports, site visits)
- Subrecipient fraud can implicate Foundation (liable for federal funds)

**Control 4: Unallowable Cost Screening**
- Accountant reviews all grant expenses for unallowable costs (alcohol, lobbying, entertainment, first-class travel)
- OMB Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200) defines unallowable costs for federal grants

---

### Grant Reporting Safeguards

**Dual Review**:
- Program Manager drafts grant report (outcomes, metrics)
- Grant Manager reviews financial data (expenses, budget vs. actual)
- ED signs off before submission (final accountability)

**False Reporting Consequences**:
- Federal: False Claims Act penalties ($11,000-$22,000 per false claim + 3× damages)
- State: Grant repayment + interest + penalties
- Reputational: Funder blacklists Foundation, other funders withdraw

**Documentation Retention**: Grant files kept for 7 years after final report (OMB requirement, IRS best practice).

---

## Conflict of Interest Management

### Annual Conflict of Interest Disclosure

**Who**: All Board members, officers, senior staff (ED, COO, CFO, Development Director)
**When**: Annually (January) + when conflict arises
**Form**: Board members complete Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form

**Questions Asked**:
1. Do you have financial interest in any vendor doing business with Foundation?
2. Do you serve on Board of any organization that partners with Foundation?
3. Do you have family member employed by Foundation or partner organization?
4. Do you receive compensation from Foundation (other than ED, staff)?
5. Have you received gifts >$100 from any vendor, donor, or partner?

**Board Action**: If conflict disclosed, Board votes whether conflict is material (requires recusal) or immaterial (monitoring sufficient).

---

### Conflict of Interest Violations

**Common Violations**:
- Board member's company hired as vendor without disclosure (self-dealing)
- ED hires family member without Board knowledge (nepotism)
- Staff member refers patients to own business (private benefit)
- Board member votes on grant to organization they lead (conflict)

**IRS Sanctions**: Intermediate sanctions—IRS can impose tax penalty on individual (25% of benefit) and Foundation (10% of benefit). Severe cases: Loss of 501(c)(3) status.

**Foundation Response**:
- Void contract (if self-dealing)
- Terminate employee (if egregious)
- Report to IRS (Form 990 disclosure)
- Implement additional controls

---

### Related Party Transactions

**IRS Definition**: Transactions between Foundation and insider (Board member, officer, substantial contributor, family member).

**When Allowed**: Related party transactions are LEGAL if:
1. Transaction is fair market value (not sweetheart deal)
2. Disclosed to Board
3. Board approves transaction without conflicted party's vote
4. Documented in Board minutes

**Example**: Board member's law firm hired for $10K legal services.
- ✅ Allowed: If firm's rate is market rate, Board approves after conflict disclosed, firm provides excellent service
- ❌ Not Allowed: If firm overcharges, or Board member votes on own contract

**Form 990 Reporting**: All related party transactions disclosed on Schedule L (public document).

---

## Investigation Procedures

### When to Investigate

**Automatic Investigation Triggers**:
- Whistleblower report alleging fraud
- Audit finding of missing funds >$5,000
- Employee terminates suddenly and financials don't reconcile
- Vendor complains they weren't paid (but Foundation records show check issued)
- Bank account discrepancy >$10,000

**Investigation Authority**: Board Audit Committee (or Ethics Committee) authorizes investigations, hires investigator, receives findings.

---

### External Investigator vs. Internal

**Use External Investigator When**:
- Alleged fraud >$25,000
- ED or Board member implicated (internal investigation has conflict)
- Potential criminal prosecution (need independent forensic accounting)
- Legal complexity (employment law, securities fraud)

**Cost**: $10,000-$50,000 for forensic accountant + employment attorney.

**Use Internal Investigation When**:
- Small amounts (<$5,000)
- Clear-cut policy violation (not criminal)
- No executive involvement
- COO or HR Manager has expertise

---

### Investigation Process

**Step 1: Preserve Evidence** (Day 1)
- Secure employee's office, computer, email account
- Prevent document destruction (instruct IT to preserve emails, files)
- Restrict employee's access to financial systems

**Step 2: Place Employee on Leave** (Day 1)
- Administrative leave (paid) pending investigation
- Do NOT accuse yet (innocent until proven guilty)
- Employee may have legal representation

**Step 3: Collect Documents** (Days 2-7)
- Bank statements, credit card receipts, invoices, contracts
- Email searches (keyword: employee name, vendor names, money terms)
- Accounting records (QuickBooks, expense reports)

**Step 4: Interview Witnesses** (Days 7-21)
- Start with indirect witnesses (colleagues, supervisors)
- Interview accused employee last (after facts established)
- Document all interviews (notes, recordings if state allows)

**Step 5: Forensic Analysis** (Days 14-30)
- Accountant traces money flow (where did funds go?)
- Recreate transactions (identify fake vendors, diverted checks)
- Calculate loss amount

**Step 6: Report to Board** (Day 30)
- Investigator presents findings: Evidence of fraud? Amount? Responsible party?
- Board decides: Terminate? Prosecute? Demand restitution?

## Disciplinary Actions & Termination

### Disciplinary Matrix for Fraud

| **Fraud Type**              | **Amount**     | **Discipline**                                  | **Prosecution?** |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Unintentional Error**     | Any            | Counseling, retraining, no discipline           | No               |
| **Minor Expense Fraud**     | <$500          | Written warning, repayment, probation 90 days   | Unlikely         |
| **Moderate Expense Fraud**  | $500-$5,000    | Termination, repayment, possible prosecution    | Maybe            |
| **Serious Embezzlement**    | $5,000-$50K    | Termination, prosecution, restitution, civil suit | Yes            |
| **Major Embezzlement**      | >$50,000       | Termination, criminal prosecution, asset seizure| Definitely       |
| **Grant Fraud**             | Any            | Termination, report to funder, prosecution      | Yes (federal)    |

---

### Termination for Fraud

**Legal Considerations**:
- **At-Will Employment**: Most states, can terminate without cause—but fraud is clear cause
- **Document Everything**: Investigation report, evidence, witness statements (defend against wrongful termination claim)
- **Consult Attorney**: Before terminating, review with employment attorney (minimize liability)

**Termination Meeting**:
- HR + ED present (witness)
- Brief, factual: "Investigation concluded you embezzled $X. Your employment is terminated effective immediately."
- Retrieve keys, ID badge, laptop, credit card
- Escort employee off premises (don't allow return to desk unsupervised)
- Disable email, systems access immediately

**Severance**: Generally NO severance for fraud termination (termination for cause). But may negotiate settlement if employee returns funds.

---

## Recovery of Misappropriated Funds

### Demand Restitution First

**Demand Letter** (from attorney):
- "Foundation discovered you embezzled $X. Demand return of funds within 30 days or Foundation will pursue criminal charges and civil lawsuit."

**Settlement Negotiation**:
- Employee may offer partial repayment (better than nothing)
- Installment plan (if employee broke, pay $500/month for 5 years)
- Trade: Employee returns funds, Foundation doesn't prosecute (depends on amount—Board may refuse if >$25K)

**Repayment Agreement**: If Foundation accepts repayment, get signed contract (enforceable if employee defaults).

---

### Criminal Prosecution

**When to Prosecute**:
- Fraud >$5,000 (felony in most states)
- Employee refuses restitution
- Board wants deterrent effect (send message)

**Process**:
1. Report to police (white-collar crimes unit)
2. Police investigate, DA decides whether to charge
3. If convicted, employee may be ordered to pay restitution to Foundation (criminal court order)

**Foundation's Role**: Victim witness—provide evidence, testify if needed.

**Downside**: Prosecution takes 1-3 years, uncertain recovery (employee may be broke). But establishes deterrent.

---

### Civil Lawsuit

**When to Sue**:
- Fraud >$10,000
- Employee has assets (home equity, retirement account, garnishable wages)
- Criminal prosecution declined or too slow

**Causes of Action**:
- Breach of fiduciary duty
- Conversion (theft)
- Fraud
- Unjust enrichment

**Remedies**: Money judgment, asset seizure, wage garnishment.

**Cost**: $15,000-$50,000 in attorney fees. Only worthwhile if employee has assets.

---

### Insurance Recovery

**Fidelity Bond** (Employee Dishonesty Coverage):
- Coverage: Reimburses Foundation for employee theft
- Typical Limit: $100,000-$500,000
- Deductible: $5,000-$25,000
- Cost: $500-$2,000/year

**Claims Process**:
1. Notify insurance carrier within 30 days of discovering fraud
2. Provide investigation report, proof of loss
3. Carrier investigates (may hire own investigator)
4. Carrier pays claim (Foundation still pursues employee for restitution—assign recovery rights to insurer)

**Note**: Many foundations don't carry fidelity bonds (common mistake). Highly recommended for Year 2+.

---

## Legal Reporting Obligations

### IRS Reporting (Form 990)

**Schedule O (Supplemental Information)**:
- Question: "Did the organization become aware of any material diversion of assets?"
- If YES: Describe diversion, corrective action, amounts recovered
- **Must Report**: Fraud >$50,000 or any amount involving officer/director

**Failure to Report**: IRS penalties for false 990 ($10,000+ per false return), potential loss of 501(c)(3) status.

---

### State Attorney General

**Ohio** (and most states):
- State AG's Charitable Law Section oversees nonprofits
- Must report fraud >$50,000 or fraud involving Board member
- AG can investigate, demand corrective action, remove Board

**Report**: Letter to AG describing fraud, Foundation's response, recovery efforts.

---

### Grant Funders

**Federal Grants**:
- Must report fraud involving federal funds to funder (NIH, NSF, etc.) and OIG (Office of Inspector General)
- Failure to report = False Claims Act violation (Foundation could be liable)

**Private Funders**:
- Report if grant funds involved or if funder's contract requires disclosure
- Most funders appreciate transparency (shows Foundation took corrective action)

---

## Fraud Risk Assessment

### Annual Fraud Risk Assessment (Board Audit Committee)

**Process**: Committee evaluates fraud risk areas, rates likelihood/impact, implements controls.

**Risk Assessment Matrix**:

| **Fraud Risk Area**        | **Likelihood** | **Impact** | **Current Controls**       | **Additional Controls Needed** |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Expense Reimbursement**  | Medium         | Low        | Monthly review, receipts   | Random audits                  |
| **Credit Card Fraud**      | Medium         | Medium     | Monthly statements review  | Daily alerts, receipt policy   |
| **Embezzlement (Checks)**  | Low            | High       | Dual signatures >$5K       | All checks >$1K dual signature |
| **Payroll Fraud**          | Low            | Medium     | Payroll outsourced (ADP)   | Quarterly payroll audit        |
| **Grant Fraud**            | Low            | High       | Time & effort reporting    | External grant audits          |
| **Vendor Fraud**           | Medium         | Medium     | W-9, vendor verification   | Three-way match (PO system)    |
| **Donation Theft**         | Low            | Low        | Dual cash count            | Online giving >cash            |

**Action Plan**: Committee prioritizes high-likelihood/high-impact risks, directs management to implement additional controls.

---

## Employee Training & Awareness

### Annual Fraud Awareness Training

**Who**: All staff with financial access (accounting, development, program managers who handle budgets)
**When**: Annually (January), plus all new hires
**Duration**: 60 minutes (in-person or online)

**Topics Covered**:
1. **What Is Fraud**: Definitions, examples specific to nonprofits
2. **Foundation's Controls**: Why dual signatures, approvals, audits exist
3. **Red Flags**: How to spot fraud by colleagues (unusual behavior, lifestyle changes)
4. **Reporting**: How to report suspicions (hotline, Board Chair)
5. **Whistleblower Protection**: Legal protections, no retaliation
6. **Consequences**: Termination, prosecution, restitution (deterrent message)

**Acknowledgment**: Employees sign statement: "I attended training, understand fraud prevention policies, agree to comply."

---

### Culture of Integrity

**Tone at the Top**: ED and Board Chair model ethical behavior (transparent expenses, follow policies, encourage reporting).

**Open Door Policy**: Staff encouraged to ask questions ("Is this expense allowed?" better than guessing).

**Celebrate Honesty**: Reward employees who catch errors, report concerns (even if false alarm—better safe than sorry).

---

## Internal Audit Schedule

### Internal Audit vs. External Audit

**External Audit** (Annual Financial Audit):
- CPA firm audits financial statements (required if budget >$750,000 or some grants require)
- Tests samples of transactions, opines on accuracy
- **Limitation**: Doesn't test all transactions, not designed to catch fraud (auditor not investigator)

**Internal Audit**:
- Foundation's own review (Treasurer, Audit Committee, or hired internal auditor)
- More frequent (quarterly), more targeted (fraud-focused)
- Tests 100% of certain transactions (e.g., all credit card expenses)

---

### Quarterly Internal Audit Checklist

**Q1 (January-March)**:
- [ ] Review all expenses >$5,000 (100% sample)
- [ ] Test segregation of duties (bank rec signer ≠ check writer)
- [ ] Verify dual signatures on checks >threshold
- [ ] Reconcile grant expenses to grant budgets

**Q2 (April-June)**:
- [ ] Surprise cash count (petty cash, event cash boxes)
- [ ] Credit card statement review (all charges, receipts matched)

## Conclusion

### Fraud Prevention = Mission Protection

**Bottom Line**: Donor trust is Foundation's most valuable asset. One fraud scandal can destroy years of reputation-building.

**Balancing Act**: Strong controls without bureaucracy—protect funds while allowing staff to work efficiently.

**Board Responsibility**: Fiduciary duty requires Board to implement reasonable fraud prevention measures. IRS and state AGs expect it.

**Investment**: $8,000-$35,000/year prevents $100,000+ losses. ROI is clear.
