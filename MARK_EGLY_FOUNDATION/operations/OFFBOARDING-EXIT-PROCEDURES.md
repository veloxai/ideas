## Offboarding Philosophy

### Foundation's Approach to Departures

**Every Exit Matters**: Whether employee leaves for better opportunity, retires after long tenure, or terminates for cause—how Foundation handles departure impacts reputation, team morale, and legal risk. Professional, respectful offboarding = organizational maturity.

**Minimize Disruption**: Departures create knowledge gaps, workload redistribution, team uncertainty. Structured offboarding captures institutional knowledge, cross-trains successors, and maintains continuity (patients still served, grants still submitted, donors still stewarded).

**Legal Protection**: Improper terminations = wrongful termination lawsuits ($50K-$500K+ settlements). Offboarding checklist ensures compliance: final pay, COBRA notification, unemployment, references—protects Foundation from claims.

**Maintain Relationships**: Today's departing employee = tomorrow's donor, Board member, volunteer, referral source, or boomerang hire. Exit gracefully = preserve goodwill (even if termination, treat with dignity—don't burn bridges unless egregious misconduct).

---

### Benefits of Structured Offboarding

**For Foundation**:

- ✅ **Knowledge Retention**: Critical information documented (donor relationships, grant deadlines, patient protocols—not lost when employee walks out)
- ✅ **Security**: System access revoked, equipment returned, data protected (prevent disgruntled ex-employee accessing patient records or stealing donor list)
- ✅ **Legal Compliance**: Final pay on time, COBRA notification, unemployment insurance—avoid penalties, lawsuits
- ✅ **Continuity**: Team prepared for departure (responsibilities reassigned, backfill recruited, no dropped balls)

**For Departing Employee**:

- ✅ **Clarity**: Understand timeline, final pay, benefits continuation, references (reduce anxiety, facilitate transition)
- ✅ **Dignity**: Professional treatment (not escorted out by security unless security threat—standard 2-week transition period)
- ✅ **Support**: Career advice, networking, references (Foundation invested in employee—help them succeed in next chapter)

---

### Offboarding Timeline

**Standard Notice Period**: 2 weeks (professional norm—gives Foundation time to transition, employee time to wrap up)

**Extended Notice** (Voluntary, Senior Roles):

- Executive Director: 4-8 weeks (Board search committee, fundraising continuity critical)
- Directors/Managers: 3-4 weeks (team transition, hire/train replacement)

**Immediate Departure** (Involuntary, Cause):

- Gross misconduct (theft, HIPAA breach, violence—terminate immediately, no transition period)
- Performance termination (end of PIP—may offer 1-2 weeks transition or immediate with severance)

---

## Types of Employee Separations

### 1. Voluntary Resignation

**Definition**: Employee initiates departure (new job, relocation, career change, personal reasons, retirement)

**Process**: Submit resignation letter → manager acceptance → 2-week transition → exit interview → final paycheck → COBRA

**Tone**: Positive, supportive (thank for contributions, wish well, maintain relationship)

---

### 2. Involuntary Termination (Cause)

**Definition**: Foundation initiates separation due to performance deficiencies, policy violations, or misconduct

**Subcategories**:

- **Performance**: Failed PIP, consistently misses goals, lacks skills (attempted to help, unsuccessful)
- **Policy Violation**: Repeated tardiness, insubordination, minor misconduct (warned, continued)
- **Gross Misconduct**: Theft, harassment, HIPAA breach, violence, fraud (immediate termination, no severance)

**Process**: Manager recommendation → COO/ED approval → termination meeting → immediate departure (or brief transition if amicable) → final paycheck → unemployment eligibility

**Tone**: Firm, respectful (not cruel—acknowledge person's humanity even if performance lacking)

---

### 3. Layoff / Reduction in Force (RIF)

**Definition**: Foundation eliminates position due to budget constraints, strategic shift, or reorganization (not performance-based)

**Example**: Grant funding lost ($200K cut) → eliminate Development Coordinator role (employee performed well, but Foundation can't afford)

**Process**: ED/Board decision → COO prepares severance → individual meetings → 2-4 weeks notice or severance in lieu → unemployment eligibility → outplacement support

**Tone**: Compassionate, transparent (acknowledge it's not employee's fault, explain business rationale, provide support)

---

### 4. Retirement

**Definition**: Employee exits workforce permanently (typically age 65+, or earlier if financially able)

**Process**: 3-6 months notice (long transition for knowledge transfer, celebration planning) → retirement party → ongoing relationship as emeritus advisor, volunteer, or donor

**Tone**: Celebratory, grateful (honor career, legacy, contributions—make memorable send-off)

---

### 5. Mutual Separation Agreement

**Definition**: Foundation and employee agree departure best for both (performance concerns + employee unhappy = amicable split)

**Example**: Development Director not meeting goals, frustrated with role, Foundation wants change → negotiate 4-week transition, positive reference, small severance—both parties benefit

**Process**: Negotiation (COO + employee, possibly attorneys) → written agreement (severance, reference terms, non-disparagement) → structured exit → unemployment eligibility

**Tone**: Professional, win-win (acknowledge fit wasn't right, part ways respectfully)

---

## Resignation Process (Voluntary)

### Step 1: Employee Submits Resignation Letter

**When**: At least 2 weeks before intended last day (professional courtesy—more if senior role)

**Format**: Written email (to manager + COO) or formal letter

**Template**:

```
Subject: Resignation Notice – [Employee Name]

Dear [Manager Name],

I am writing to formally resign from my position as [Job Title] at the Mark Egly Foundation, effective [Last Day, 2 weeks from today].

[Optional: Brief reason—new opportunity, relocation, personal—not required but courteous]

I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the Foundation's mission [optional: highlight 1-2 accomplishments or experiences]. I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition and will work with you to [knowledge transfer, train replacement, complete projects].

Thank you for your support during my time here. I wish the Foundation continued success.

Sincerely,
[Employee Name]
```

**What Employee Should NOT Do**:

- ❌ Resign verbally only (must be written—documentation for unemployment, references)
- ❌ Give <2 weeks notice without discussion (emergency acceptable, but communicate early if possible)
- ❌ Trash Foundation on social media (unprofessional, damages reputation—yours and Foundation's)

---

### Step 2: Manager Acknowledges & Notifies COO

**Immediate Actions** (Within 24 hours):

1. **Reply to Employee**: "Thank you for your notice. Let's schedule a meeting to discuss transition plan. I wish you well in your next role."
2. **Notify COO**: Forward resignation email + discussion (COO coordinates offboarding checklist, payroll, benefits)
3. **Assess Impact**: How critical is role? Can wait 2 weeks or need coverage immediately? Start recruitment?

**Emotional Response** (Manager Self-Care):

- Normal to feel disappointed, frustrated, or anxious (especially if star performer or inconvenient timing)
- Don't guilt-trip employee ("We need you, how could you leave?")—unprofessional, won't change decision
- Focus on transition, not blame

---

### Step 3: Transition Planning Meeting (Manager + Employee)

**Timing**: Within 2-3 days of resignation

**Agenda** (30-60 minutes):

1. **Confirm Last Day**: 2 weeks from resignation date (adjust if needed—employee may have flexibility, or Foundation may need more/less time)
2. **Knowledge Transfer Plan**: What needs to be documented? Who will take over responsibilities?
3. **Project Handoff**: What's in progress? Can finish or reassign?
4. **Communication**: When/how to announce departure to team, external stakeholders (donors, partners)?
5. **Exit Interview**: Schedule with COO (last week of employment)

**Documentation**: Manager completes Transition Plan Template (Google Doc—shared with COO, incoming employee or team covering duties)

---

### Step 4: Announce Departure

**Internal Announcement** (Team Email or All-Staff Meeting):

- **Timing**: After employee informed, before external announcement (1-2 days)
- **Who Announces**: Manager or ED (if senior role)
- **Tone**: Positive, appreciative (even if employee difficult—focus on contributions, not grievances)

**Template**:

```
Subject: [Employee Name] Moving to New Opportunity

Team,

I want to share that [Employee Name], our [Job Title], has accepted a new opportunity and will be departing the Foundation on [Last Day].

[Employee] has contributed significantly to our mission during [his/her/their] time here, including [1-2 specific accomplishments—enrolled 50 patients in registry, secured $200K NIH grant, launched Alpha-1 Awareness Month]. We are grateful for [his/her/their] dedication and wish [him/her/them] success in [his/her/their] next chapter.

[Transition plan—"Jane will be covering patient navigation duties until we hire a replacement," or "We are beginning a search for a new Development Director"].

Please join me in thanking [Employee] for [his/her/their] service. [Optional: We'll celebrate at a farewell lunch on [Date].]

Best,
[Manager/ED Name]
```

**External Announcement** (If Public-Facing Role—ED, Development Director):

- **Timing**: After internal announcement (same day or next day)
- **Channels**: Email to donors/partners, social media (LinkedIn, Foundation website)
- **Tone**: Positive transition (avoid "abrupt departure"—conveys instability)

**Template** (LinkedIn):

```
After [X years] of impactful work at the Mark Egly Foundation, [Employee Name] is moving on to [new opportunity]. We're grateful for [his/her/their] leadership in [key accomplishments] and wish [him/her/them] all the best. [Employee]'s passion for Alpha-1 advocacy will be missed, but we know [he/she/they] will continue making a difference. Thank you, [Employee]! 🙏
```

---

### Step 5: Last Two Weeks (Transition Period)

**Employee Responsibilities**:

- [ ] **Document Processes**: Write SOPs (standard operating procedures—how to submit grant, manage donor CRM, enroll patients in registry)
- [ ] **Train Successor**: If replacement hired, train (shadow, co-work, answer questions)
- [ ] **Complete Projects**: Finish or hand off in-progress work (if grant due, finish and submit; if halfway, brief successor)
- [ ] **Return Equipment**: Laptop, monitor, keys, badge, company credit card (see Section 8)
- [ ] **Exit Interview**: Meet with COO (last week—see Section 5)

**Manager Responsibilities**:

- [ ] **Reassign Duties**: Temporary coverage until replacement hired (distribute among team, hire temp, or manager absorbs)
- [ ] **Stakeholder Notification**: Inform external contacts (donors, partners—"Jane leaving, I'm interim contact, or John taking over")
- [ ] **Celebrate**: Farewell lunch, card, small gift (acknowledge contributions—$50-$100 budget per departure)

---

## Termination Process (Involuntary)

### When Termination Appropriate

**Performance-Based** (After PIP):

- Employee completed 60-90 day PIP, no improvement (or minimal improvement insufficient)
- Documented warnings, coaching, support provided—termination last resort, not surprise

**Policy Violation**:

- Repeated violations despite warnings (tardiness, dress code, insubordination)
- Single serious violation (harassment complaint substantiated, HIPAA breach, conflict of interest undisclosed)

**Gross Misconduct** (Immediate Termination):

- Theft, fraud, embezzlement (misappropriated Foundation funds)
- Violence, threats, weapons (safety risk to team, patients)
- Severe HIPAA breach (sold patient data, intentional unauthorized access)
- Illegal activity (drug use at work, assault, arrested for crime affecting job)

---

### Termination Decision & Approval

**Step 1: Manager Recommendation**:

- Manager documents performance issues, PIP failure, or misconduct (emails, performance reviews, warnings, incident reports)
- Submits termination recommendation to COO (written memo: rationale, evidence, proposed termination date)

**Step 2: COO Review**:

- Legal check (does documentation support termination? any discrimination concerns—age, race, disability, retaliation for whistleblowing?)
- Consult employment attorney (Year 1-2: $500-$1K consultation; Year 3+: retained attorney reviews all terminations)
- Decision: Approve, modify (PIP extension, coaching), or deny (insufficient cause)

**Step 3: ED Approval** (All terminations require ED sign-off—especially involuntary)

**Step 4: Prepare Termination Meeting**:

- COO drafts termination letter (reason, effective date, final pay, COBRA, unemployment)
- IT prepares access revocation (ready to execute immediately after meeting—email, systems, building access)
- Manager + COO schedule meeting (30 minutes, private, end of day Friday preferred—allows weekend to process)

---

### Termination Meeting

**Attendees**: Manager + COO + Employee (HR witness—COO—critical for legal protection, ensures fair process)

**Not Attendees**: Other team members (confidential—employees don't know until after)

**Location**: Private office or conference room (not public, not Zoom unless fully remote employee)

**Timing**: End of day Friday (minimizes disruption—employee doesn't return to desk, packs belongings without audience; team notified Monday)

---

**Meeting Script** (Manager leads, COO witnesses):

**Opening** (Manager, 2 min):

> "Thank you for meeting. This is a difficult conversation. We've decided to end your employment with the Mark Egly Foundation, effective today. [COO Name] is here to discuss next steps."

**Do NOT**:

- ❌ Apologize excessively ("I'm so sorry, this is terrible, I feel awful")—undermines decision, confuses employee
- ❌ Negotiate ("Maybe we can try another PIP?")—decision final, no debate
- ❌ Allow argument ("You're wrong, I did improve!")—acknowledge feelings, don't relitigate

**Rationale** (Manager, 3 min):

> "This decision is based on [performance deficiencies/policy violations]. Despite our efforts to support you—[PIP, coaching, warnings]—we have not seen sufficient improvement in [specific areas: missed deadlines, quality issues, attendance]. We believe this is best for both you and the Foundation."

**OR** (Gross Misconduct):

> "This decision is based on [specific incident: HIPAA violation on October 15 when you accessed 20 patient records without authorization]. This violates Foundation policy and federal law, and we cannot continue your employment."

**Next Steps** (COO, 5 min):

> "Here's your termination letter outlining effective date, final paycheck, and benefits. Your final paycheck will be [direct deposit Friday / mailed within 7 days per Ohio law]. You are eligible for unemployment insurance—we will not contest unless gross misconduct. You will receive COBRA notification for health insurance continuation within 14 days. We need you to return all Foundation property today: [laptop, badge, keys]. [Manager Name] will accompany you to your desk to collect personal items."

**Questions** (5 min):

- Employee may ask: "Why now?" "Can I have more time?" "Will you give me a reference?"
- Manager/COO: Answer factually, calmly (not defensive—"Decision is final. We will provide employment verification [dates, title], but not detailed reference given performance issues.")

**Closing** (Manager, 1 min):

> "We wish you success in your next role. Thank you for your time at the Foundation."

**Do NOT**:

- ❌ Hug, get emotional (remain professional, even if employee crying)
- ❌ Discuss with other employees immediately (wait until employee departs, then notify team)

---

### Post-Termination (Immediate Actions)

**IT Access Revocation** (COO texts IT Manager as employee packing desk):

- [ ] Disable email, Google Workspace, Salesforce, REDCap, Asana, Slack (within 15 minutes)
- [ ] Disable VPN, building badge, alarm code (if applicable)
- [ ] Remote wipe company devices (if employee doesn't return laptop immediately—Find My Mac/Windows)

**Equipment Return**:

- Manager accompanies employee to desk (not to intimidate—to ensure Foundation property returned, no sabotage)
- Employee packs personal items (photos, coffee mug, coat—15-30 minutes)
- Employee returns: Laptop, monitor, keyboard, mouse, badge, keys, company credit card
- If refuses, note on termination checklist (Foundation may deduct from final paycheck if state law allows, or pursue legally)

**Departure**: Manager escorts to exit (not security guard unless safety concern—maintain dignity)

---

### Team Notification (Monday Morning)

**Manager or ED announces** (email or all-staff meeting):

```
Subject: Team Update

Team,

I want to inform you that [Employee Name] is no longer with the Mark Egly Foundation, effective [Date]. We appreciate [his/her/their] contributions and wish [him/her/them] well.

[Responsibilities] will be covered by [Manager/Team Members] while we [recruit replacement / reorganize]. Please reach out if you have questions about work assignments.

Thank you for your professionalism during this transition.

Best,
[Manager/ED Name]
```

**What NOT to Say**:

- ❌ "Jane was fired for poor performance" (confidential, unprofessional, potential defamation)
- ❌ "Jane was terminated for misconduct" (unless criminal/public record—HIPAA breach reported to OCR, theft reported to police)
- ✅ "Jane is no longer with the Foundation" (neutral, sufficient)

---

## Exit Interviews

### Purpose

**Why Exit Interviews Matter**:

- **Honest Feedback**: Departing employees = candid (no fear of retaliation, want to help improve Foundation or vent frustrations)
- **Identify Patterns**: If 3 employees say "Manager micromanages" or "Workload unsustainable"—systemic issue to fix
- **Retention Insights**: Why people leave = what to change (compensation too low? lack of growth? mission drift?)
- **Legal Protection**: Document employee's perspective (if later claim discrimination, exit interview shows no concerns raised)

---

### Who Conducts

**COO Conducts All Exit Interviews** (Not Direct Manager):

- Manager = conflict of interest (employee may not be honest if complaining about manager)
- COO = neutral third party (can receive criticism, investigate, act)

**Exception**: If COO is the problem (employee complaining about COO), ED conducts

---

### Timing

**Voluntary Resignation**: Last week of employment (employee still engaged, not yet fully mentally departed)

**Involuntary Termination**: Optional (if amicable performance termination, offer exit interview; if gross misconduct, skip—unlikely to be productive)

**Layoff/RIF**: Yes (especially important—employee not at fault, feedback valuable)

---

### Exit Interview Questions

**Format**: 30-60 minute conversation (in-person or Zoom if remote)

**Confidentiality**: "This conversation is confidential. I'll summarize themes for leadership without identifying you, unless you disclose illegal activity (discrimination, harassment, fraud) which I'm required to investigate."

---

**Questions** (15-20 questions, adjust based on role):

**1. Reason for Leaving**:

- What prompted your decision to leave?
- What could the Foundation have done to retain you?

**2. Role & Responsibilities**:

- Did your job match expectations when hired? Any surprises?
- Was workload manageable? Too much? Too little?
- Were goals clear? Resources adequate?

**3. Management & Leadership**:

- How would you describe your relationship with your manager?
- Did you receive sufficient feedback, coaching, support?
- Any concerns about management style or decisions?

**4. Team & Culture**:

- How would you describe Foundation culture? (Collaborative? Siloed? Mission-driven? Dysfunctional?)
- Did you feel valued and included?
- Any interpersonal conflicts or concerns?

**5. Compensation & Benefits**:

- Was compensation competitive? Fair?
- Were benefits adequate? (Health insurance, PTO, 401k)
- Any suggestions for improvement?

**6. Growth & Development**:

- Did you have opportunities to learn and grow?
- Career advancement path clear?
- Training and development sufficient?

**7. Mission & Strategy**:

- Did you feel connected to the mission?
- Was strategic direction clear?
- Any concerns about Foundation's future?

**8. Organizational Improvements**:

- If you were ED, what's the first thing you'd change?
- What does Foundation do well? (Don't just focus on negatives)
- Any advice for your successor?

**9. Legal/Compliance Concerns**:

- Did you witness or experience discrimination, harassment, or retaliation?
- Any concerns about financial practices, data security, or compliance?
- (If yes, COO must investigate immediately—cannot ignore)

**10. Final Thoughts**:

- Anything else you'd like to share?
- Would you recommend the Foundation as a place to work?
- Would you consider returning in the future? (Boomerang hire)

---

### Documentation & Follow-Up

**COO Documents** (Exit Interview Notes Template):

- Date, employee name, role, tenure
- Summary of feedback (themes, direct quotes if particularly insightful or concerning)
- Action items (if systemic issue—manager coaching, workload rebalancing, compensation review)

**Quarterly Review** (COO + ED):

- Aggregate exit interview data (every 3 months—patterns?)
- Share themes with leadership (anonymized—"3 of 4 exits cited low pay," not "Jane said pay is low")
- Implement changes (if compensation issue, budget for raises; if manager issue, coach or performance manage manager)

**Retention Impact**: Organizations that act on exit interview feedback = 10-15% lower turnover (employees see Foundation listens, improves)

---

## Knowledge Transfer

### Why Knowledge Transfer Critical

**Single Point of Failure Risk**:

- Development Director = only person who knows top donor relationships, grant deadlines
- Patient Navigator = only person patients trust, knows registry enrollment process
- If leave suddenly (quit, illness, accident) = knowledge lost, operations disrupted

**Mitigation**: Proactive documentation + transition period

---

### Knowledge Transfer Checklist

**Employee Completes** (Last 2 weeks):

**1. Processes & Procedures**:

- [ ] Document daily/weekly/monthly tasks (step-by-step—how to submit grant, enroll patient, process donation)
- [ ] Identify critical deadlines (grant due dates, donor meetings, patient appointments)
- [ ] Create SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures—Google Docs in shared folder, not personal laptop)

**2. Contacts & Relationships**:

- [ ] List key stakeholders (donors, partners, patients—names, contact info, relationship notes)
- [ ] Introduce successor (if hired—email intro, joint call, smooth handoff)
- [ ] Notify external contacts (if no successor yet—"I'm leaving, [Manager] is interim contact")

**3. Passwords & Access**:

- [ ] Share system logins (1Password—transfer to manager or successor, not written on Post-it)
- [ ] Document where files stored (Google Drive folders, Salesforce reports, REDCap databases)
- [ ] Explain non-obvious processes (e.g., "Monthly grant report auto-generates, but must manually email to funder by 5th of month")

**4. In-Progress Projects**:

- [ ] Status update each project (% complete, next steps, blockers, deadlines)
- [ ] Handoff files (drafts, data, supporting materials—organized folder, not scattered Desktop)
- [ ] Brief successor or team (30-60 min meeting—Q&A, context)

**5. Institutional Knowledge**:

- [ ] History/context (why we do things this way, past attempts, landmines to avoid—"Don't mention Competitor Foundation to Board Chair, long feud")
- [ ] Lessons learned (what worked, what didn't—"Grant X was nightmare, avoid that funder")

---

### Knowledge Transfer Meeting (Manager + Employee + Successor/Team)

**Timing**: Week before last day

**Agenda** (60-90 min):

- Employee walks through documentation (screen share—here's Salesforce, here's grant tracker, here's patient resource library)
- Q&A (successor asks clarifying questions)
- Manager assigns follow-up tasks (successor shadows for remaining days, or manager reviews SOPs after departure)

**Documentation Repository**: Google Drive folder "Offboarding - [Employee Name]" (accessible to manager, successor, COO—retained 1 year post-departure)

---

## System Access Revocation

### Why Access Revocation Critical

**Security Risks**:

- **Data Breach**: Disgruntled ex-employee downloads patient records, donor list (HIPAA violation, donor trust loss)
- **Sabotage**: Deletes files, emails clients inappropriate messages, changes passwords to lock team out
- **Liability**: If ex-employee causes breach, Foundation liable (negligent to leave access active)

**Legal Requirement**: HIPAA Security Rule requires termination of access upon separation (immediate for involuntary, within 24 hours for voluntary)

---

### Access Revocation Checklist

**IT Manager Executes** (Involuntary: immediately; Voluntary: last day)

**1. Email & Communication**:

- [ ] Disable Google Workspace account (email, Drive, Calendar—don't delete immediately, forward to manager for 30 days then archive)
- [ ] Remove from Slack (deactivate account, DMs archived)
- [ ] Disable Zoom account (if host license, transfer to replacement)

**2. Business Systems**:

- [ ] Revoke Salesforce access (if owns records, reassign to manager)
- [ ] Revoke REDCap access (patient data—critical for HIPAA compliance)
- [ ] Revoke Asana (project management—reassign tasks)
- [ ] Revoke accounting system (QuickBooks—financial data)
- [ ] Revoke donor CRM, email marketing (Mailchimp, etc.)

**3. Remote Access**:

- [ ] Disable VPN (if used for remote work)
- [ ] Remove from SSO (Google, Okta—single sign-on cascade disables multiple apps)
- [ ] Revoke API keys, developer access (if technical role)

**4. Physical Access**:

- [ ] Deactivate building badge (keycard access)
- [ ] Change alarm code (if employee knew it)
- [ ] Retrieve keys (office, file cabinets, storage)

**5. Financial Access**:

- [ ] Cancel company credit card (call issuer, close account)
- [ ] Remove from bank account (if signatory—requires bank form)
- [ ] Revoke procurement approvals (vendor accounts, Amazon Business, etc.)

**6. Social Media & External**:

- [ ] Remove as admin/contributor (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter—Foundation accounts)
- [ ] Revoke website CMS access (WordPress, Squarespace)
- [ ] Update "Team" page (remove photo, bio—or mark "Former Staff" if long-tenured)

**7. Devices**:

- [ ] Remote wipe laptop, phone (if not returned—Find My Mac, Windows Intune)
- [ ] Disable access from personal devices (if BYOD—remove email profile)

---

### Verification

**IT Manager Confirms** (Checklist completed within 24 hours of departure):

- [ ] All systems access tested (attempt login—should fail)
- [ ] Manager notified (email: "All access revoked for [Employee], equipment returned")
- [ ] COO documents in personnel file (access revocation completed [Date])

---

## Equipment & Asset Return

### Foundation Property to Return

**Standard Equipment** (All employees):

- [ ] Laptop (MacBook or Dell—Foundation-issued)
- [ ] Monitor, keyboard, mouse (if provided for remote work)
- [ ] Headset, webcam (if provided)
- [ ] Charging cables, adapters
- [ ] Company phone (if issued—iPhone or Android)
- [ ] Badge, keys, access cards
- [ ] Company credit card (cut in half, return to COO)

**Role-Specific**:

- [ ] Branded materials (business cards, marketing materials—destroy or return)
- [ ] Books, resources (if Foundation purchased—return to library)
- [ ] Patient records, files (paper—confidential, return to manager for secure storage)

**What Employee Keeps**:

- ✅ Personal items (photos, coffee mug, gifts from colleagues—not Foundation logo items)
- ✅ Personal files (resume, performance reviews—but NOT Foundation work product, patient data, donor lists)

---

### Return Process

**Voluntary Resignation**:

- Last day: Employee brings all equipment to office (or ships if fully remote—prepaid label provided by COO)
- Manager inspects, signs off (Equipment Return Form—Google Form with photos)

**Involuntary Termination**:

- Immediately: Return equipment during termination meeting (or mail within 3 days—registered mail)
- If refuses: Final paycheck withheld until return (if state law allows—Ohio does NOT allow, must pay then pursue legally for unreturned property)

**Fully Remote Employees**:

- COO sends prepaid UPS label (2-day shipping)
- Equipment must arrive within 5 business days of last day
- If not returned: Report to HR system, pursue legally (small claims court—$500-$2K laptop loss)

---

### Equipment Condition

**Acceptable Wear**: Normal use (scuffs, minor scratches, keys worn)

**Unacceptable Damage**: Cracked screen, liquid damage, missing components (power adapter, SSD removed)—employee may be charged replacement cost (if willful damage)

**IT Manager Assesses** (Within 1 week of return):

- Wipe/reimage for next employee (security—previous user's data erased)
- Repair if needed (screen replacement $200-$400—budget annually $500 for damage)
- Retire if beyond repair (>3 years old, not worth fixing—donate to nonprofit tech recycler)

---

## Final Paycheck & Benefits

### Final Paycheck (Ohio Law Compliance)

**Timing**:

- **Voluntary Resignation**: Next regular payday (if resign 2 weeks, last paycheck processes normal biweekly schedule)
- **Involuntary Termination**: Within reasonable time (Ohio law: no specific deadline, but best practice = within 7 days or next regular payday, whichever sooner)

**What's Included**:

- ✅ Unpaid salary (last worked days)
- ✅ Accrued unused PTO (Ohio: employer must pay out if policy promises—Foundation policy: Yes, pay out up to 40 hours carryover; Year 1 = forfeit beyond that, Year 2+ = pay per policy)
- ✅ Earned bonuses (if bonus period completed—Q4 bonus paid in Q4 if employee worked full quarter; prorated if left mid-quarter)
- ❌ Future PTO (not accrued yet)
- ❌ Severance (only if laid off or mutual separation agreement—not standard resignation or termination for cause)

**Deductions** (Legal):

- Final health insurance premium (if mid-month departure, prorated premium deducted)
- Outstanding loans (if Foundation loaned employee money—repayment agreement signed)
- Unreturned equipment (if state law allows—Ohio generally NO, must pursue separately)

**Payment Method**: Direct deposit (if active) or paper check mailed to home address

---

### Accrued PTO Payout Calculation

**Example**:

- Employee: 15 PTO days/year (accrues 1.25 days/month)
- Worked 8 months = 10 days accrued
- Used 7 days = 3 days unused
- Final paycheck: 3 days × daily rate ($50K salary ÷ 260 workdays = $192/day × 3 = $576 PTO payout)

**Policy Note**: Foundation Employee Handbook states unused PTO paid up to 40 hours (5 days)—if employee has 60 hours (7.5 days) accrued, pays 40 hours, forfeits 20 hours (unless state law requires full payout—check annually)

---

### COBRA Notification (Health Insurance Continuation)

**What is COBRA**: Federal law (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act)—allows employees who lose job-based health insurance to continue coverage temporarily at own expense

**Who Qualifies**:

- ✅ Voluntary resignation
- ✅ Involuntary termination (except gross misconduct)
- ✅ Reduced hours (full-time → part-time, loses eligibility)

**Not Eligible**:

- ❌ Gross misconduct termination (theft, fraud—Foundation can deny COBRA)
- ❌ Employee enrolls in spouse's plan or new employer plan (COBRA unnecessary)

**Cost**: Employee pays 102% of premium (100% employer + employee share + 2% admin fee)

- Example: Premium $500/month (employer paid $400, employee paid $100) → COBRA = $510/month employee pays

**Duration**: 18 months (can extend to 36 months if disability or other qualifying events)

---

**COBRA Notification Timeline** (Legal Requirement):

1. **Day 1-14**: COO notifies COBRA administrator (Gusto, or benefits broker—they send COBRA packet)
2. **Day 14-44**: Employee receives COBRA election notice (packet with forms, instructions, deadlines)
3. **Day 45-60**: Employee elects COBRA (if wants coverage, returns form + first premium payment)
4. **Day 60+**: Coverage active (backdated to last day of employment—no gap if elected on time)

**COO Responsibility**: Track COBRA deadlines (Asana task auto-created on termination date: "Send COBRA notice for [Employee] by [Date 14 days post-termination]")

**Penalty for Non-Compliance**: $110/day per affected employee (if fail to notify on time—DOL penalty)

### Unemployment Insurance

**Eligibility**:

- ✅ Voluntary resignation: Maybe (if quit for "good cause"—unsafe work, harassment, constructive discharge)—state determines
- ✅ Involuntary termination (performance): Yes (employee not at fault—poor fit, lacks skills—Foundation shouldn't contest)
- ✅ Layoff/RIF: Yes (definitely eligible)
- ❌ Gross misconduct: No (theft, fraud, violence—Foundation contests, likely denied)

**Foundation's Role**:

- Employee files unemployment claim with Ohio Department of Job & Family Services
- State sends Foundation questionnaire (reason for separation, wages, dates)
- COO responds (factual—"Employee terminated for performance deficiencies after PIP" or "Employee resigned voluntarily")
- State decides eligibility (if approve, Foundation's unemployment insurance premiums may increase slightly—but don't contest unless gross misconduct, wastes time/goodwill)

**Best Practice**: Don't contest unless clear disqualifying reason (misconduct)—contesting performance terminations = petty, harms reputation, rarely wins

---

### 401(k) Rollover

**Employee Options** (After Separation):

1. **Leave in Foundation Plan**: If balance >$5K, can stay indefinitely (no new contributions, but investments stay)
2. **Rollover to New Employer 401(k)**: Transfer balance to new job's plan (if they accept rollovers)
3. **Rollover to IRA**: Transfer to personal Fidelity/Vanguard IRA (most common—more investment options)
4. **Cash Out**: Withdraw funds (pay taxes + 10% penalty if under 59.5—not recommended unless desperate)

**Foundation Action**: None required (employee initiates—COO provides 401k provider contact: Guideline, Vanguard, Fidelity)

**COO Sends Benefits Termination Letter** (Within 7 days of departure):

- Summary of what terminates when
- COBRA packet (if applicable)
- 401(k) rollover options
- FSA deadline
- Contact for questions (COO email, phone)

## References & Alumni Relations

### Reference Policy

**Foundation's Standard Practice**:

- **Employment Verification Only** (Neutral): Confirm dates of employment, job title, salary (if requested in writing)—HR/COO provides
- **Detailed References** (Discretionary): Manager or ED may provide if relationship positive—but not required, not standardized

**Rationale**: Limit liability (if give negative reference and hurt employee's job prospects, risk defamation lawsuit; if give positive reference and employee underperforms at new job, risk negligent referral claim—rare but possible)

---

### Reference Categories

**1. Standard Employment Verification** (All Departures):

- **Who**: COO responds (not manager—consistency)
- **What**: "Jane Doe worked at Mark Egly Foundation from January 2024 to November 2025 as Development Coordinator. Salary $50,000/year. [If asked: Eligible for rehire? Yes/No]."
- **How**: Written request only (email or official form from new employer)

**2. Positive Reference** (Voluntary Resignation, Good Standing):

- **Who**: Manager or ED (employee requests, manager agrees)
- **What**: "Jane was excellent—strong grant writer, reliable, mission-driven. Secured $200K NIH grant, enrolled 50 patients in registry. Would rehire if opportunity arises."
- **How**: Phone call or LinkedIn recommendation (new employer calls manager directly)

**3. Neutral Reference** (Performance Issues but Not Misconduct):

- **Who**: COO or manager
- **What**: Employment verification only (dates, title)—decline detailed reference ("Foundation policy is to confirm employment only")
- **How**: Politely decline (don't bash employee to new employer—legally risky, ethically questionable)

**4. No Reference** (Gross Misconduct Termination):

- **Who**: COO declines
- **What**: "I can confirm employment dates and title, but cannot provide a reference."
- **How**: If pressed, may say "Separated due to policy violation"—but no details (HIPAA breach = can't disclose patient data involved, even to explain termination)

---

### Employee Rights & Disputes

**If Employee Disagrees with Reference**:

- Employee can request copy (if written reference)—Foundation provides
- Employee can dispute (if factually incorrect—fix it; if opinion—Foundation not required to change)
- Employee can sue (defamation—if reference false and malicious; rare to win, but Foundation wants to avoid)

**Best Practice**: If uncertain, say less (employment verification only = safest)

---

### Alumni Network (Year 3+)

**Why Maintain Relationships**:

- Former employees = donors (grateful for experience, want to give back)
- Former employees = volunteers (serve on committees, mentor current staff)
- Former employees = referral sources (recommend patients, partners, board members)
- Former employees = boomerang hires (return with new skills, outside perspective—10-15% of new hires = boomerangs at mature nonprofits)

**Alumni Engagement** (COO Coordinates):

- **LinkedIn Group**: "Mark Egly Foundation Alumni" (share updates, job postings, celebrate wins)
- **Annual Alumni Event**: Virtual happy hour or in-person gathering (20-30 alumni—reconnect, celebrate mission impact)
- **Newsletter**: Quarterly email (Foundation updates, research breakthroughs, patient stories—keep former staff engaged)
- **Volunteer Opportunities**: Invite to events (gala, awareness month activities), ask to serve on committees (development, patient advocacy)

**Budget**: $500-$1K/year (event catering, LinkedIn premium for alumni group, staff time)

**ROI**: Alumni donate $5K-$20K/year collectively (Year 5+), refer 2-3 major donors annually, provide pro bono consulting (marketing, legal, accounting—save $10K-$50K)

## Conclusion: Offboarding = Final Impression

**Foundation's Offboarding Philosophy Recap**:

- ✅ **Professional, Respectful**: Every departure handled with dignity (voluntary or involuntary—treat employee as valued human, not disposable resource)
- ✅ **Legally Compliant**: Final pay on time, COBRA notification, unemployment cooperation (avoid penalties, lawsuits)
- ✅ **Knowledge Retention**: SOPs documented, successor trained, institutional memory preserved (minimize disruption)
- ✅ **Security-First**: Access revoked, equipment returned, data protected (prevent breaches, sabotage)
- ✅ **Relationship Maintenance**: Alumni network, positive references, no bridge-burning (today's departing employee = tomorrow's donor, board member, or boomerang hire)

**Success Metrics** (Track Annually):

- **Offboarding Compliance**: 100% of departures complete checklist (final pay on time, COBRA sent, access revoked, equipment returned)
- **Exit Interview Participation**: 80%+ voluntary resignations complete exit interview (yield actionable feedback)
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Zero critical knowledge gaps (no "only Jane knew how to do X" scenarios—SOPs documented)
- **Alumni Engagement**: 50%+ former employees stay connected (LinkedIn, newsletter)—donate, volunteer, or refer within 2 years
- **Legal Issues**: Zero wrongful termination claims, discrimination complaints (robust documentation, fair process = protection)

**ROI of Structured Offboarding**:

- **Risk Mitigation**: Proper terminations avoid lawsuits ($50K-$500K+ settlements—offboarding checklist = $0 legal fees vs. messy departure)
- **Knowledge Continuity**: SOPs save 50-100 hours onboarding successor (not reinventing wheel—"Here's how Jane did X, keep doing it")
- **Alumni Value**: Former staff donate, volunteer, refer (Year 5+: alumni contribute $20K-$50K annually in donations, pro bono services, referrals)
- **Reputation**: Professional offboarding = positive Glassdoor reviews, LinkedIn recommendations (attract future talent—"Foundation treats departing employees well, even if terminated")

**"How we say goodbye is as important as how we say hello. Offboarding done right protects the Foundation legally, operationally, and reputationally—and honors the humanity of every person who contributed to our mission, however briefly."**
