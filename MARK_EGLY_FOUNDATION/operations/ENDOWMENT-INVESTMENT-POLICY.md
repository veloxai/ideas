## Endowment Philosophy & Purpose

### What is an Endowment?

**Definition**: Permanent fund invested to generate income—Foundation spends only investment returns (typically 4-5% annually), preserving principal in perpetuity.

**Purpose**:
- **Financial Stability**: Reliable income stream during economic downturns, funding gaps
- **Mission Longevity**: Ensure Foundation serves AATD patients for generations
- **Strategic Flexibility**: Discretionary funds for emerging opportunities (new treatments, research breakthroughs)
- **Donor Legacy**: Honor major donors who want lasting impact

**Endowment vs. Operating Reserves**:
- **Operating Reserves** (3-6 months expenses): Short-term safety net, liquid investments (money market, short-term bonds)
- **Endowment** (permanent): Long-term growth, diversified investments (stocks, bonds, alternatives)

---

### When to Establish Endowment

**Foundation Timeline**:
- **Year 1-3**: Focus on building operating budget, programs, donor base—no endowment yet (need cash flow for startup)
- **Year 4-5**: Once operating budget stable ($2M-$5M), begin endowment with:
  - **Major gift** ($500K-$1M founding gift from lead donor)
  - **Planned giving** (bequests, life insurance policies)
  - **Capital campaign** (multi-year effort to raise $5M-$10M endowment)

**Critical Threshold**: Don't launch endowment until Foundation has:
- ✅ 3-6 months operating reserves (financial stability first)
- ✅ Strong annual fundraising ($1M-$2M/year—proves sustainability)
- ✅ Board commitment to long-term stewardship (endowments are permanent—Board must embrace)

---

### Types of Endowments

**1. Unrestricted Endowment** (Best for Flexibility):
- Board determines how income spent (general operations, programs, strategic initiatives)
- Foundation can respond to changing needs (e.g., new AATD therapy approved, need patient access program)

**2. Restricted Endowment** (Honors Donor Intent):
- Donor specifies purpose: "Income supports AATD research grants in perpetuity"
- Foundation must comply with restriction (legal obligation under donor agreement)
- Examples: Research endowment, patient assistance endowment, education endowment

**3. Quasi-Endowment** (Board-Designated):
- Board sets aside operating funds as "endowment" but retains right to invade principal if needed
- Treated like endowment for investment purposes but legally unrestricted
- Useful for growing endowment while maintaining flexibility

**Foundation Strategy**: Start with unrestricted or quasi-endowment (Year 4-5), add restricted endowments as major donors emerge (Year 6+).

---

## Investment Objectives & Goals

### Primary Objectives

**Objective 1: Preserve Purchasing Power** (Inflation Protection)
- Endowment must grow faster than inflation (3% historical average)
- If endowment returns 3% and Foundation spends 5%, endowment shrinks over time (intergenerational inequity—future generations get less)
- **Target**: Returns > Spending Rate + Inflation + Investment Costs

**Math**:
- Spending rate: 5%
- Inflation: 3%
- Investment costs: 0.5-1%
- **Required return**: 5% + 3% + 1% = **9%/year** (before fees)
- **Realistic return**: 6-8%/year (long-term stock/bond portfolio)—means occasional principal invasion during market downturns (acceptable if temporary)

---

**Objective 2: Generate Stable Income** (Mission Support)
- Endowment distributions support programs—must be predictable (can't triple one year, drop 50% next year)
- **Smoothing mechanism**: Spending policy averages market value over 3-5 years (see spending policy section)

**Objective 3: Grow for Future Needs** (Long-Term Growth)
- AATD research advancing (gene therapy, new treatments)—Foundation needs resources to scale
- Endowment should grow in real terms (after inflation, spending) by 1-2%/year

### Return Expectations by Asset Class

**Historical Returns** (1926-2024, Ibbotson data):

| **Asset Class**           | **Average Annual Return** | **Volatility (Std Dev)** | **Worst Year** | **Best Year** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------- |
| **Large-Cap Stocks (S&P 500)** | 10.2%              | 18.5%                    | -43% (2008)    | +54% (1933)   |
| **Small-Cap Stocks**      | 12.1%                     | 25.6%                    | -58% (1937)    | +143% (1933)  |
| **International Stocks**  | 8.5%                      | 20.3%                    | -45% (2008)    | +69% (1986)   |
| **Corporate Bonds**       | 6.3%                      | 8.4%                     | -8% (2008)     | +43% (1982)   |
| **Government Bonds**      | 5.5%                      | 5.7%                     | -11% (2009)    | +32% (1982)   |
| **Real Estate (REITs)**   | 11.8%                     | 21.0%                    | -37% (2008)    | +47% (1976)   |
| **Commodities**           | 4.5%                      | 23.1%                    | -46% (2008)    | +41% (1973)   |
| **Cash (T-Bills)**        | 3.3%                      | 0.9%                     | 0% (2008)      | +14% (1981)   |

**Key Insights**:
- **Stocks outperform long-term** (10%+) but volatile (lose 40%+ in worst years)
- **Bonds stabilize** (6% returns, lower volatility)
- **Diversification reduces risk** (mix of stocks/bonds/alternatives)

## Asset Allocation Strategy

### Strategic Asset Allocation

**Target Allocation** (Foundation with moderate risk tolerance, 20+ year time horizon):

| **Asset Class**              | **Target %** | **Acceptable Range** | **Purpose**                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Domestic Stocks (U.S.)**   | 35%          | 30-40%               | Growth engine, inflation hedge             |
| **International Stocks**     | 20%          | 15-25%               | Diversification, global exposure           |
| **Fixed Income (Bonds)**     | 30%          | 25-35%               | Stability, income, downside protection     |
| **Real Estate (REITs)**      | 7.5%         | 5-10%                | Inflation hedge, income                    |
| **Alternatives**             | 7.5%         | 5-10%                | Diversification (hedge funds, private equity, commodities) |
| **Cash & Cash Equivalents**  | 0%           | 0-5%                 | Liquidity for distributions (rebalancing)  |
| **Total**                    | **100%**     |                      |                                            |

**Expected Return**: 7-8%/year (long-term)
**Expected Volatility**: 10-12% (standard deviation—typical 60/40 stock/bond portfolio)

---

### Asset Allocation by Foundation Life Stage

**Stage 1: Building Phase** (Years 4-7, Endowment <$2M):
- **Aggressive allocation**: 70% stocks, 25% bonds, 5% alternatives
- **Rationale**: Long time horizon, no immediate spending needs—maximize growth
- **Risk**: High volatility (30% swings), but time to recover

**Stage 2: Growth Phase** (Years 8-12, Endowment $2M-$10M):
- **Moderate allocation**: 55% stocks, 30% bonds, 10% real estate, 5% alternatives
- **Rationale**: Balancing growth with stability—Foundation starting to spend distributions
- **Risk**: Moderate volatility (20% swings)

**Stage 3: Mature Phase** (Years 13+, Endowment >$10M):
- **Balanced allocation**: 50% stocks, 35% bonds, 10% real estate, 5% alternatives
- **Rationale**: Intergenerational equity—preserve purchasing power for future
- **Risk**: Lower volatility (15% swings), predictable income

---

### Tactical Asset Allocation (Optional)

**Strategic vs. Tactical**:
- **Strategic**: Long-term, buy-and-hold allocation (above)—rarely changes
- **Tactical**: Short-term adjustments based on market conditions (opportunistic)

**Example Tactical Adjustment**:
- **Scenario**: Stock market overvalued (P/E ratios at historic highs), recession likely
- **Tactical shift**: Reduce stocks from 55% to 50%, increase bonds to 35% (defensive positioning)
- **Duration**: 6-12 months, then return to strategic allocation

**Foundation Policy**: Tactical shifts allowed within acceptable ranges (±5% from target), Investment Committee approval required, reviewed quarterly.

---

## Risk Tolerance & Time Horizon

### Risk Assessment

**Foundation's Risk Tolerance**: **Moderate** (balanced growth and preservation)

**Factors Determining Risk Tolerance**:

**1. Time Horizon**: Endowment is permanent (infinite time horizon)—can weather market downturns, justify higher stock allocation.

**2. Spending Needs**: If Foundation spends 5% annually, needs stable distributions—too much volatility creates budgeting challenges.

**3. Donor Expectations**: Major donors expect prudent management—reckless investments (crypto, individual stocks) damage trust.

**4. Regulatory Environment**: IRS requires "prudent investor" standard (Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act—UPMIFA)—must diversify, avoid excessive risk.

**5. Board Comfort**: If Board panics during market downturns ("We lost 30%! Sell everything!"), allocation too aggressive—educate Board or reduce risk.

---

### Stress Testing

**Scenario Analysis** (How much could endowment lose in crisis?):

**Baseline Allocation** (55% stocks, 30% bonds, 15% alternatives/real estate):

| **Scenario**                  | **Stocks** | **Bonds** | **Alternatives** | **Portfolio Impact** | **Recovery Time** |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Mild Recession** (2001)     | -12%       | +8%       | -5%              | **-4%**              | 1 year            |
| **Financial Crisis** (2008)   | -37%       | +5%       | -20%             | **-19%**             | 4 years           |
| **Pandemic Shock** (2020)     | -20%       | +8%       | -10%             | **-8%**              | 6 months          |
| **Severe Depression** (1930s) | -50%       | +10%      | -30%             | **-30%**             | 10+ years         |

**Foundation's Preparedness**:
- Can Foundation survive 20-30% endowment loss? (Yes, if spending policy smooths distributions)
- Would Board demand changes? (Educate Board: Short-term losses are normal, stay the course)
- Communication plan: Quarterly reports explain market context, long-term perspective

---

## Spending Policy & Distribution Rate

### Spending Rate Determination

**Industry Standard**: **4-5%** of endowment market value annually

**Foundation Policy**: **5%** (slightly aggressive but justified for young nonprofit with mission urgency)

**Why 5%**:
- ✅ **Mission impact**: Serves more AATD patients today (vs. hoarding for future)
- ✅ **Donor appeal**: Donors see funds used, not sitting idle
- ✅ **Feasible**: 7-8% expected returns - 5% spending = 2-3% real growth (after inflation)

**Why NOT 6-7%** (too high):
- ❌ Endowment shrinks over time (intergenerational inequity—robbing future patients)
- ❌ Market downturns force principal invasion (permanent loss)
- ❌ Donor concern: "Are they raiding endowment?"

---

### Spending Policy Formula

**3-Year Rolling Average** (smoothing mechanism):

**Formula**:
```
Annual Distribution = 5% × Average Endowment Market Value (prior 12 quarters)
```

**Example**:

| **Quarter** | **Endowment Value** |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| Q1 2023     | $9,500,000          |
| Q2 2023     | $9,800,000          |
| Q3 2023     | $10,000,000         |
| Q4 2023     | $10,200,000         |
| Q1 2024     | $10,500,000         |
| Q2 2024     | $10,300,000         |
| Q3 2024     | $10,600,000         |
| Q4 2024     | $10,800,000         |
| Q1 2025     | $11,000,000         |
| Q2 2025     | $11,200,000         |
| Q3 2025     | $11,500,000         |
| Q4 2025     | $11,800,000         |
| **Average** | **$10,600,000**     |

**2026 Distribution**: 5% × $10,600,000 = **$530,000**

---

**Benefits of Rolling Average**:
- ✅ **Stability**: Distribution changes gradually (even if market volatile)
- ✅ **Predictability**: Foundation can budget year ahead (knows approximate distribution)
- ✅ **Discipline**: Prevents over-spending in bull markets, under-spending in bear markets

**Alternative Methods** (less common):
- **Prior-year value**: 5% of Dec 31, 2025 value ($11.8M) = $590K (more volatile)
- **Fixed dollar amount**: $500K/year (doesn't grow with endowment—erodes with inflation)

---

### Distribution Timing

**Quarterly Distributions**: $530,000 ÷ 4 = **$132,500/quarter**

**Transfer Date**: 15th of January, April, July, October (aligns with operating budget cash flow)

**Process**:
1. Investment Manager calculates endowment value (prior 12 quarters average)
2. Treasurer approves distribution amount (confirms formula applied correctly)
3. Investment Manager liquidates investments (sell stocks/bonds to raise cash)
4. Wire transfer to Foundation operating account
5. Finance Director records revenue: "Endowment distribution—unrestricted"

---

### Spending Flexibility

**Floor & Ceiling** (guardrails to prevent extreme distributions):

**Floor**: Minimum distribution = **3%** of current market value
- Protects mission during prolonged bear markets (if rolling average lags reality, Foundation can spend more)

**Ceiling**: Maximum distribution = **7%** of current market value
- Prevents over-spending during bull markets (if rolling average lags reality, cap spending to preserve principal)

**Example**:
- Rolling average: $10.6M → 5% = $530K
- Current value: $8.0M (market crash)
- Floor: 3% × $8.0M = $240K → Foundation spends $240K (not $530K—would deplete endowment)

---

## Rebalancing Procedures

### Why Rebalance?

**Drift**: Over time, stocks outperform bonds → allocation shifts from 55/30/15 to 65/25/10 (higher risk than intended).

**Rebalancing**: Sell outperformers (stocks), buy underperformers (bonds) → restore target allocation.

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Maintains risk profile (prevents portfolio becoming too aggressive or conservative)
- ✅ Discipline: "Sell high, buy low" (counterintuitive but effective)
- ✅ Tax efficiency: Nonprofits don't pay capital gains tax (rebalancing is free)

---

### Rebalancing Triggers

**Calendar-Based** (Simplest):
- **Quarterly rebalancing**: Every January, April, July, October
- **Pros**: Simple, predictable
- **Cons**: May rebalance unnecessarily (if allocation still within range)

**Threshold-Based** (Foundation's Policy):
- **Rebalance when asset class drifts >5% from target**
- **Example**: Target 55% stocks, current 61% → rebalance (6% drift)
- **Pros**: Reduces transaction costs, only rebalances when needed
- **Cons**: Requires monitoring

**Hybrid** (Best Practice):
- Review quarterly, rebalance if drift >5% OR at least annually (even if <5% drift)

---

### Rebalancing Process

**Step 1: Calculate Current Allocation**
- Investment Manager provides portfolio valuation: Stocks 61%, Bonds 26%, Alternatives 13%

**Step 2: Compare to Target**
- Target: 55% stocks, 30% bonds, 15% alternatives
- Drift: Stocks +6%, Bonds -4%, Alternatives -2%

**Step 3: Determine Trades**
- Sell: 6% of portfolio in stocks ($636,000 if portfolio = $10.6M)
- Buy: 4% bonds ($424,000), 2% alternatives ($212,000)

**Step 4: Execute**
- Investment Manager executes trades (same day, minimize market timing risk)

**Step 5: Confirm**
- Treasurer reviews post-rebalancing allocation: 55% stocks, 30% bonds, 15% alternatives ✅

**Step 6: Document**
- Minutes of Investment Committee meeting: "Approved rebalancing on [Date], restoring target allocation"

---

## Investment Manager Selection

### In-House vs. Outsourced Management

**Year 4-7** (Endowment <$5M):
- **Outsource**: Low-cost index funds (Vanguard, Fidelity)—no investment manager needed
- **Rationale**: Small endowment doesn't justify manager fees (1%/year on $2M = $20K—better spent on programs)

**Year 8-12** (Endowment $5M-$20M):
- **Balanced index funds OR robo-advisor** (Vanguard Personal Advisor Services, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios)
- **Cost**: 0.10-0.50%/year
- **Rationale**: Automated rebalancing, tax-loss harvesting (though nonprofits don't need), phone support

**Year 13+** (Endowment >$20M):
- **Active investment manager** (wealth management firm, foundation-focused advisor)
- **Cost**: 0.50-1.00%/year (negotiable—larger endowments get discounts)
- **Rationale**: Customized strategies, sophisticated alternatives (private equity, hedge funds), personal service

---

### Manager Selection Criteria

**RFP Process** (Request for Proposal):

**Distribute RFP to 5-7 Firms**:
- Large banks (Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley)
- Independent RIAs (Registered Investment Advisors)
- Foundation specialists (Cambridge Associates, NEPC—serve nonprofits exclusively)

**RFP Questions**:
1. **Experience**: How many nonprofit endowments do you manage? Average size?
2. **Philosophy**: Active vs. passive management? ESG integration?
3. **Performance**: 5-year, 10-year track record (net of fees)
4. **Fees**: All-in cost (management fees, fund expenses, transaction costs)
5. **Services**: Reporting frequency, Investment Committee support, UPMIFA compliance
6. **References**: Contact info for 3 similar-sized nonprofits

**Decision**: Firm B selected (highest score, strong fee value, excellent nonprofit experience).

---

### Manager Contract Terms

**Key Provisions**:
- **Discretionary authority**: Manager can trade without pre-approval (Foundation sets policy, manager executes)
- **Custody**: Assets held at third-party custodian (Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard)—manager never takes possession (fraud prevention)
- **Reporting**: Quarterly performance reports, annual UPMIFA compliance statement
- **Termination**: Either party can terminate with 30 days notice (no penalty, full asset portability)
- **Fiduciary duty**: Manager acts as fiduciary (legally obligated to act in Foundation's best interest)

---

## Performance Benchmarks & Evaluation

### Benchmark Selection

**Purpose**: Compare endowment performance to objective standard (ensures manager adding value).

**Foundation's Composite Benchmark** (matches target allocation):
- 35% S&P 500 (U.S. large-cap stocks)
- 20% MSCI EAFE (International stocks)
- 30% Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index (U.S. investment-grade bonds)
- 7.5% FTSE NAREIT (Real estate)
- 7.5% HFRI Fund Weighted Composite (Hedge funds / alternatives)

**Example Calculation** (2025 returns):

| **Index**                     | **2025 Return** | **Weight** | **Contribution** |
| ----------------------------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| S&P 500                       | +12.0%          | 35%        | +4.2%            |
| MSCI EAFE                     | +8.5%           | 20%        | +1.7%            |
| Bloomberg Agg Bond            | +3.5%           | 30%        | +1.05%           |
| FTSE NAREIT                   | +10.0%          | 7.5%       | +0.75%           |
| HFRI Fund Weighted Composite  | +6.0%           | 7.5%       | +0.45%           |
| **Composite Benchmark Return**|                 |            | **+8.15%**       |

**Foundation's Actual Return**: +8.8%
**Outperformance**: +0.65% (65 basis points above benchmark—good performance)

---

### Performance Evaluation Criteria

**Annual Review** (Investment Committee, December):

**Metric 1: Absolute Return**
- Did endowment meet return objective (7-8%/year long-term)?
- **Pass**: 5-year average ≥7%
- **Concern**: 5-year average <6%

**Metric 2: Benchmark Relative Performance**
- Did manager beat composite benchmark (net of fees)?
- **Pass**: Outperformance or within -0.5%/year
- **Concern**: Underperformance >0.5%/year (3+ consecutive years)

**Metric 3: Peer Comparison**
- How does Foundation compare to similar endowments?
- **Source**: NACUBO-TIAA Endowment Study (annual survey, 700+ institutions)
- **Pass**: Top 50th percentile (above median)
- **Concern**: Bottom 25th percentile (3+ consecutive years)

**Metric 4: Risk-Adjusted Return**
- Sharpe Ratio: (Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Volatility
- **Pass**: Sharpe Ratio >0.5 (generating return for risk taken)
- **Concern**: Sharpe Ratio <0.3 (taking risk without return)

---

### Manager Termination Criteria

**Red Flags** (consider replacing manager):
- ❌ Underperformance vs. benchmark >1%/year (3+ years)
- ❌ Style drift (manager straying from agreed strategy—e.g., taking excessive risk)
- ❌ Key personnel departure (portfolio manager leaves, replacement unproven)
- ❌ Regulatory issues (SEC investigation, fines)
- ❌ Fee increases (without justification, value-add)

**Process**:
1. Investment Committee discusses concerns (give manager opportunity to explain)
2. If unresolved, issue RFP for replacement
3. Board approves manager change
4. Transition assets (coordinated transfer to new manager—minimize market exposure)

---

## ESG & Impact Investing Considerations

### Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) Integration

**Foundation's ESG Policy**: **Integrate ESG factors into investment decisions** (without sacrificing returns).

**Rationale**:
- ✅ **Mission alignment**: Foundation serves patients—investments shouldn't harm health (tobacco, pollution)
- ✅ **Risk management**: ESG leaders have lower regulatory, reputational, operational risks
- ✅ **Donor expectations**: Major donors (especially younger donors) expect responsible investing

---

### ESG Implementation Approaches

**Level 1: Negative Screening** (Exclusions)
- **Exclude industries**: Tobacco, firearms, fossil fuels, private prisons
- **Impact**: Reduces portfolio by ~5-10% (tobacco = 1% of S&P 500, fossil fuels = 4%)
- **Performance impact**: Minimal (tobacco underperformed S&P 500 past 20 years due to litigation, declining use)

**Level 2: Positive Screening** (Best-in-Class)
- **Overweight ESG leaders**: Companies with strong labor practices, environmental records, Board diversity
- **Tools**: MSCI ESG Ratings, Sustainalytics, CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project)
- **Example**: Invest in Microsoft (ESG leader) over ExxonMobil (ESG laggard)

**Level 3: Impact Investing** (Mission-Related Investments)
- **Direct investments in AATD-related companies**: Grifols (AATD therapy manufacturer), biotech startups
- **Risks**: Concentrated risk (single-industry), liquidity risk (private companies), conflicts (if Foundation advocates against company)
- **Allocation**: Limit to 5% of endowment (diversification protection)

**Foundation's Approach** (Year 4-7):
- **Start with Level 1** (negative screening—simple, low-cost)
- **Progress to Level 2** (Year 8+, when endowment >$10M—justify research costs)
- **Consider Level 3** (Year 13+, when endowment >$50M—can absorb risk)

### ESG Fund Options

**Broad Market ESG Funds**:
- **Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV)**: 0.09% expense ratio, excludes tobacco, weapons, fossil fuels
- **iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF (SUSA)**: 0.25% expense ratio, positive screening (ESG leaders)
- **Parnassus Core Equity Fund (PRBLX)**: 0.87% expense ratio, actively managed ESG, 20-year track record

**ESG Bond Funds**:
- **Calvert Green Bond Fund**: Invests in bonds financing environmental projects (renewable energy, green buildings)
- **TIAA-CREF Social Choice Bond Fund**: Excludes tobacco, weapons, private prisons

**Performance**: ESG funds historically perform comparable to conventional funds (MSCI ESG Index = S&P 500 ±1% over 10 years)—no return sacrifice.

## Investment Committee Structure

### Committee Composition

**Size**: 5-7 members (large enough for diverse expertise, small enough for decisions)

**Members**:
- **Board Treasurer** (Chair): Leads committee, coordinates with full Board
- **Board Members** (2-3): Bring finance, investment, business expertise

## Donor-Restricted Funds

### Managing Restricted Endowments

**Challenge**: Donor restricts endowment income to specific purpose ("Research grants only")—Foundation must track separately, ensure compliance.

**Accounting**: Each restricted fund = separate sub-account (QuickBooks classes or projects)

**Example**:

| **Endowment Fund**            | **Principal** | **FY2025 Income** | **Restrictions**                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **General Endowment**         | $8,000,000    | $400,000          | Unrestricted (Board discretion)           |
| **Smith Family Research Fund**| $2,000,000    | $100,000          | AATD research grants only                 |
| **Patient Assistance Fund**   | $1,000,000    | $50,000           | Direct patient financial assistance       |
| **Total Endowment**           | **$11,000,000** | **$550,000**    |                                           |

**Spending**:
- General Endowment income ($400K) → Board allocates (operations, programs, strategic initiatives)
- Research Fund income ($100K) → Must award research grants (cannot use for operations)
- Patient Assistance income ($50K) → Must provide direct patient aid (cannot fund staff salaries)

---

### Underwater Endowments

**Definition**: Restricted endowment market value falls below original gift amount (donor gave $1M, now worth $900K).

**Cause**: Market downturn (2008, 2020 crashes), over-spending (Foundation spent 7-8% annually)

**UPMIFA Rules** (Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act):
- **Old rule** (pre-2008): Could NOT spend from underwater endowments (legally prohibited—principal sacrosanct)
- **New rule** (post-2008): CAN spend prudently from underwater endowments (considering duration, expected return, Foundation needs)

**Foundation Policy**:
- If endowment underwater <10% (worth $950K on $1M gift), continue spending per policy (3-year rolling average smooths this)
- If underwater >10%, reduce spending to 3-4% (preserve principal, allow recovery)
- Communicate transparently with donor (if living): "Market downturn temporarily reduced fund, we're managing prudently, expect recovery in X years"

---

### Donor Communications

**Annual Letter to Endowment Donors**:
> Dear [Donor],
>
> Thank you for your visionary $2M gift establishing the Smith Family Research Endowment. This year, your fund generated $100,000 in income, which supported 5 AATD research grants advancing understanding of disease mechanisms and novel therapies.
>
> **Fund Performance**:
> - Beginning balance (Jan 1, 2025): $2,050,000
> - Investment return (8.5%): +$174,250
> - Distribution (5%): -$100,000
> - Ending balance (Dec 31, 2025): $2,124,250
>
> Your legacy is growing and serving patients for generations. Thank you.
>
> Sincerely,
> [Executive Director]

## Prohibited Investments

### High-Risk / Speculative Investments

**Foundation Policy**: **Prohibited** (too risky for endowment principal):
- ❌ **Individual stocks** (concentrated risk—one company bankruptcy = large loss)
- ❌ **Cryptocurrency** (Bitcoin, Ethereum—extreme volatility, regulatory uncertainty)
- ❌ **Commodities trading** (oil futures, gold—speculative, no long-term growth)
- ❌ **Options, futures, derivatives** (unless hedging existing positions—e.g., currency hedge for international stocks)
- ❌ **Private placements** (unregistered securities—illiquid, fraud risk)
- ❌ **Peer-to-peer lending** (high default rates, no track record)

**Rationale**: Endowment is permanent—Foundation cannot afford losing 50%+ in speculative bet. Diversified index funds are boring but reliable.

---

### Conflict-of-Interest Investments

**Prohibited**:
- ❌ Investments managed by Board members, staff, or family (appearance of self-dealing)
- ❌ Investments in Foundation vendors, partners (creates conflicts—if investment underperforms, can Foundation fire vendor?)

**Exception**: If Board member is investment professional at reputable firm (Vanguard, Fidelity), can hire firm IF:
- ✅ Committee includes independent members (majority non-conflicted)
- ✅ Fees at or below market rate (no special deal)
- ✅ Board member recuses from vote (conflict disclosed, documented)

---

## Conflict of Interest Management

### Disclosure Requirements

**Annual Disclosure** (all Investment Committee members):
- List personal investments, family business interests, Board seats at other organizations
- Identify potential conflicts (e.g., Committee member owns stock in company Foundation might invest in)

**Ongoing Disclosure**: If conflict arises mid-year (Committee member joins investment firm), disclose immediately.

---

### Recusal Procedures

**If Conflict Identified**:
1. Member discloses conflict ("I own shares in XYZ fund we're considering")
2. Chair determines if material (>$10K personal investment, or >1% of Foundation portfolio—material)
3. If material, member recuses (leaves room during vote, does not participate in discussion)
4. Minutes document recusal ("John Smith recused due to personal holdings in XYZ fund")
5. Remaining members vote (quorum = 50% of non-conflicted members)

---

## Reporting & Transparency

### Quarterly Investment Reports

**Provided by Investment Manager** (within 15 days of quarter-end):

**Report Contents**:
1. **Executive Summary**: 1-page overview (return, asset allocation, notable events)
2. **Performance**: Total return (gross & net of fees), benchmark comparison, peer percentile
3. **Asset Allocation**: Current vs. target (pie chart, drift analysis)
4. **Holdings Detail**: Top 10 holdings, sector allocation, geographic exposure
5. **Fee Summary**: Management fees, fund expenses, total cost
6. **Market Commentary**: Economic outlook, portfolio positioning, outlook

---

### Annual Reporting to Stakeholders

**Form 990, Part X** (Balance Sheet):
- Report endowment as "Net Assets with Donor Restrictions" (if restricted) or "Net Assets without Donor Restrictions" (if unrestricted)

**Annual Report** (public document):
- **Endowment Overview**: Size, growth, purpose
- **Performance Summary**: 1-year, 3-year, 5-year returns
- **Investment Philosophy**: Asset allocation, ESG integration
- **Distribution Impact**: "Endowment generated $530K, supporting 200 patients"

**Donor Communications**:
- Quarterly letters to endowment donors (personalized)
- Annual donor appreciation event (recognize major endowment donors)

---

### Transparency vs. Confidentiality

**Public Disclosure** (Form 990, annual report):
- Total endowment size
- General asset allocation (% stocks, bonds, alternatives)
- Top-level performance (annual return)

**Confidential** (Investment Committee, Board only):
- Specific fund holdings (disclosing holdings creates front-running risk—traders exploit information)
- Investment manager identity (in some cases—though often public)
- Detailed fee negotiations

**Rationale**: Balance transparency (accountability to donors, public) with prudence (protecting investment strategy from exploitation).

---

## Policy Review & Updates

### Annual Review Cycle

**October Investment Committee Meeting**:
- Review full IPS (Investment Policy Statement—this document)
- Assess: Does asset allocation still match Foundation's risk tolerance, time horizon, needs?
- Consider: Changes in tax law, UPMIFA updates, market conditions, Foundation growth

**Potential Updates**:
- Adjust spending rate (if endowment underwater or over-performing)
- Modify asset allocation (if risk tolerance changes—e.g., Foundation mature, shift conservative)
- Add/remove prohibited investments (e.g., if crypto becomes mainstream, reconsider ban)
- Update ESG criteria (new screening options, impact strategies)

**Approval Process**:
- Investment Committee proposes changes → Full Board reviews → Board votes (December meeting)

---

### Triggering Events (Ad Hoc Reviews)

**Review IPS immediately if**:
- 🔴 Major market disruption (2008-style crisis—assess whether policy still appropriate)
- 🔴 Significant endowment growth (doubles in size—may justify hiring investment manager, adding alternatives)
- 🔴 Donor restriction changes (donor renegotiates terms, releases restrictions)
- 🔴 Regulatory changes (new IRS rules, UPMIFA amendments)

---
