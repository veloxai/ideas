## SEO Opportunity

### Why SEO is Foundation's #1 Patient Acquisition Channel

**The Undiagnosed Search for Answers**:

- 90,000 undiagnosed AATD patients in US (have symptoms—early COPD, liver problems, but don't know it's genetic)
- **They are Googling**: "COPD at 35," "why do I have emphysema," "genetic lung disease," "elevated liver enzymes no cause"
- If Foundation ranks #1 for these searches → capture patients BEFORE diagnosis → connect to testing/specialists → diagnose the missing 90%

**Current Search Landscape**:

- Competitors:
  - **AlphaNet** (nonprofit, strong SEO—ranks #1 for "alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency," established 20+ years)
  - **Alpha-1 Foundation** (nonprofit, moderate SEO—ranks #2-3 for primary keywords)
  - **WebMD, Mayo Clinic** (general medical sites—rank #1-5 for symptoms ["COPD young age"], not AATD-specific, opportunity to outrank with focused content)
  - **Pharmaceutical companies** (Grifols, CSL—paid ads, not organic rankings, Foundation can compete organically)

**Foundation's Advantage**:

- ✅ **Mission-driven** (no commercial bias—patients trust nonprofits > pharma, Google favors trustworthy sources)
- ✅ **Patient-centric content** (Foundation writes for patients—AlphaNet/Alpha-1 Foundation medical-focused, Foundation humanizes)
- ✅ **Comprehensive resources** (plan to create 200+ articles, videos, tools—most thorough AATD content online, Google rewards depth)

## Keyword Research

### Keyword Categories & Prioritization

**Tier 1: Disease Basics** (Highest Priority—Foundation Authority)

1. "alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency" (8,100/mo—PRIMARY KEYWORD, must rank #1-3)
2. "what is alpha-1" (720/mo—educational, Foundation's sweet spot)
3. "AATD symptoms" (390/mo—high intent, patients self-diagnosing)
4. "alpha-1 genetics" (260/mo—Foundation explains inheritance, family testing)
5. "Pi\*ZZ mutation" (170/mo—technical but searchable by newly diagnosed)

**Target Content**: Comprehensive guides (2,000-3,000 words), videos, infographics (Foundation owns these keywords—cornerstone content)

---

**Tier 2: Diagnosis & Testing** (High Priority—Drive Testing)

1. "alpha-1 testing" (480/mo—direct conversion, patient wants to test)
2. "AAT blood test" (320/mo—understand testing process)
3. "genetic testing for AATD" (210/mo—Foundation's testing partnerships, link to 23andMe, Invitae)
4. "AATD diagnosis criteria" (140/mo—physicians + patients)
5. "alpha-1 carrier screening" (110/mo—family members, cascade screening)

**Target Content**: Testing guides, FAQs, "How to Get Tested" step-by-step, specialist locator (Foundation captures patients at decision moment—"I need to test")

---

**Tier 3: Symptoms & Misdiagnosis** (Critical—Reach Undiagnosed)

1. "COPD at young age" (880/mo—HIGH VALUE, undiagnosed patients, Foundation must rank top 5)
2. "early onset emphysema" (390/mo—similar, AATD suspect)
3. "why do I have COPD never smoked" (390/mo—LONG-TAIL, high intent, patients searching for answers)
4. "genetic cause of COPD" (260/mo—educational search, lead to AATD)
5. "elevated liver enzymes no obvious cause" (1,900/mo—AATD liver disease underdiagnosed, huge opportunity)
6. "liver disease in young adults" (590/mo—AATD often missed in liver patients)

**Target Content**: Symptom checkers, "Could You Have Alpha-1?" quiz, patient stories (misdiagnosed for years, finally diagnosed—relatable), HCP resources ("When to suspect AATD")

---

**Tier 4: Treatment & Management** (Medium Priority—Engaged Patients)

1. "alpha-1 treatment" (590/mo—diagnosed patients researching options)
2. "augmentation therapy" (320/mo—deciding whether to start)
3. "AATD life expectancy" (210/mo—common anxiety question, Foundation addresses with hope + data)
4. "living with alpha-1" (170/mo—lifestyle, patient community)
5. "AATD diet" (90/mo—practical tips, Foundation humanizes)

**Target Content**: Treatment guides, lifestyle articles, support resources (Foundation serves diagnosed patients—build loyalty, encourage donations/advocacy)

---

**Tier 5: Long-Tail Keywords** (Low Volume, Very High Intent)
Examples:

- "my child diagnosed with alpha-1 what now" (10/mo—heartbreaking, parent needs support, Foundation ranks #1 easily)
- "can you have kids with alpha-1" (20/mo—family planning, Foundation addresses sensitively)
- "alpha-1 disability benefits" (30/mo—financial concerns, Foundation provides guidance)
- "AATD clinical trials near me" (40/mo—research participation, Foundation connects)

**Strategy**: Create 100+ long-tail articles (5-10 searches/month each—individually small, collectively 500-1,000 searches/month, easy to rank #1, high conversion)

---

### Competitor Keyword Gaps

**Opportunity: AlphaNet Ranks for Medical Content, Not Patient Stories**

- AlphaNet: "AATD pathophysiology" (medical), "AAT protein structure" (scientific)—serves professionals
- **Gap**: Patient experience content ("first infusion experience," "telling family about diagnosis," "dating with alpha-1")—emotional, humanized
- **Foundation Strategy**: Create 50+ patient-centric articles (AlphaNet doesn't cover—Foundation owns niche, ranks easily)

**Opportunity: No One Owns Liver Disease + AATD Content**

- "Alpha-1 liver disease" (110/mo—barely covered, WebMD general, no depth)
- "AATD cirrhosis" (40/mo—underserved keyword, Foundation can rank #1)
- "AAT and liver transplant" (30/mo—specific, Foundation writes comprehensive guide—instant #1)

---

## On-Page SEO

### Page Optimization Checklist (Every Article)

**1. Title Tag** (50-60 characters, include primary keyword):

- ✅ Good: "Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency: Symptoms, Causes, Treatment" (keyword front-loaded, clear, 58 chars)
- ❌ Bad: "Understanding a Rare Genetic Condition That Affects Lungs" (no keyword, vague, 64 chars)

**2. Meta Description** (150-160 characters, compelling + keyword):

- ✅ Good: "Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder causing lung and liver disease. Learn symptoms, testing, treatment options from the Mark Egly Foundation." (159 chars, keyword, value prop)
- ❌ Bad: "Learn about this condition." (too short, no keyword, no value)

**3. H1 Heading** (1 per page, primary keyword):

- ✅ "What is Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD)?"
- ❌ "A Rare Genetic Disorder" (no keyword)

**4. H2/H3 Subheadings** (use secondary keywords):

- H2: "AATD Symptoms: Lung and Liver Manifestations" (keyword: "AATD symptoms")
- H3: "Early Signs of Alpha-1 Lung Disease" (keyword: "early signs alpha-1")

**5. Keyword Density** (1-2%—natural, not stuffed):

- 2,000-word article → use "alpha-1" or "AATD" 20-40 times (including variations, synonyms—don't repeat exactly)

**6. Internal Links** (3-5 per article):

- Link to related Foundation pages ("Learn more about augmentation therapy" → Treatment page, "Find a specialist" → Directory)
- **Why**: Keeps users on site (reduces bounce rate), distributes link equity (improves other pages' SEO)

**7. External Links** (2-3 authoritative sources):

- Cite studies (NEJM, AJRCCM), guidelines (ATS/ERS), government (NIH, FDA)
- **Why**: Google rewards citing sources (trustworthiness signal), users appreciate references

**8. Images** (3-5 per article, optimized):

- Alt text with keywords ("Alpha-1 patient receiving augmentation therapy infusion"—descriptive + keyword)
- File names ("alpha-1-infusion.jpg"—not "IMG_1234.jpg")
- Compressed (<100KB—fast load, don't sacrifice quality)

**9. CTA (Call-to-Action)** (1-2 per article):

- "Find a specialist near you" (button → directory)
- "Join a support group" (button → support group finder)
- "Donate to fund research" (button → donation page)
- **Why**: Convert readers to engaged users (SEO brings them in, CTA converts)

**10. Schema Markup** (structured data):

- Article schema (title, author, date, image—Google shows in search results)
- Organization schema (Foundation name, logo, address—Knowledge Graph)
- FAQ schema (if article has FAQs—Google shows accordion in results, increases CTR)

---

## Technical SEO

### Site-Wide Optimizations

**1. Site Speed** (Target: <2 seconds load time)

- **Why**: Google ranking factor (2018 update), users abandon slow sites (53% bounce if >3 seconds)
- **How**:
  - Image compression (Smush plugin, WebP format—50-80% smaller)
  - Caching (WP Rocket, browser cache—return visitors instant load)
  - CDN (Cloudflare, $20/month—serve images from nearest server, global fast)
  - Lazy loading (images load as user scrolls—above-fold instant)

**Current Speed Test**: GTmetrix, Google PageSpeed Insights (aim 90+ score, Year 1 80-85, optimize to 90+ Year 2)

---

**2. Mobile-Friendliness** (65% of searches mobile)

- Responsive design (WordPress theme mobile-optimized—already covered in Website doc)
- Large tap targets (buttons 44px minimum—avoid tiny links)
- Fast mobile load (3G networks slow—extra image compression for mobile)

**Test**: Google Mobile-Friendly Test (must pass—Google mobile-first indexing, mobile version = primary)

---

**3. HTTPS** (Security = Ranking Factor)

- SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt free, or Cloudflare—already included in WP Engine hosting)
- All links https:// (no mixed content—avoid "Not Secure" browser warning)

---

**4. XML Sitemap** (Help Google Find All Pages)

- Yoast SEO auto-generates (MarkEglyFoundation.org/sitemap.xml)
- Submit to Google Search Console (tell Google to crawl—index faster)

---

**5. Robots.txt** (Control Crawling)

- Allow all content (Foundation wants everything indexed—no restrictions)
- Block admin pages (wp-admin—no SEO value, don't waste Google's crawl budget)

---

**6. Canonical Tags** (Avoid Duplicate Content)

- Each page points to itself as canonical (Yoast handles automatically)
- If syndicate content (Foundation article republished on medical site—canonical back to Foundation, Foundation gets SEO credit)

---

**7. 404 Error Handling** (Fix Broken Links)

- Custom 404 page ("Page not found, here are helpful links"—homepage, search, contact)
- Monitor broken links (Google Search Console—fix immediately, don't lose link equity)

---

## Link Building Strategy

### Why Backlinks Matter

**Google's #1 Ranking Factor**: Links from other sites = votes of confidence (more links from authoritative sites = higher rankings)

**Foundation's Link Building Goal**: 100 backlinks Year 1 → 500 backlinks Year 5 (quality > quantity—1 link from NIH worth 100 links from spammy blogs)

---

### Tier 1: Authoritative Medical Sites (Highest Value)

**Target Sites**:

- NIH MedlinePlus (medlineplus.gov—government, DA 95, link worth 10+ years of other links)
- Mayo Clinic (mayoclinic.org—trusted, DA 92)
- WebMD (webmd.com—high traffic, DA 91)
- Healthline (healthline.com—health content hub, DA 92)

**How to Earn Links**:

1. **Create link-worthy content** (comprehensive AATD guide—MedlinePlus links to "learn more" resources, Foundation must be most thorough)
2. **Reach out** (email MedlinePlus editors—"We're Mark Egly Foundation, we created comprehensive AATD resource, consider linking from your Alpha-1 page")
3. **Expert contribution** (offer Foundation's medical advisors for quotes—WebMD writing AATD article, Foundation provides expert, gets link)

**Realistic Expectation**: 5-10 links from Tier 1 sites over 5 years (difficult to earn, but extremely valuable—MedlinePlus link alone boosts rankings significantly)

---

### Tier 2: Medical Schools & Hospitals (High Value)

**Target Sites**:

- Harvard Medical School (hms.harvard.edu—DA 88)
- Cleveland Clinic (clevelandclinic.org—James Stoller, Foundation advisor—connection!)
- National Jewish Health (nationaljewish.org—Robert Sandhaus, Foundation partner)
- Medical school COPD/pulmonary department pages (UF, MUSC, OHSU—Foundation research partners)

**How to Earn Links**:

1. **Leverage partnerships** (Cleveland Clinic partners with Foundation—request link from Clinic's AATD page to Foundation resources)
2. **Guest lectures** (Foundation staff guest lecture at med schools—school posts "Guest Speaker from Mark Egly Foundation," includes link)
3. **Research collaboration** (co-funded studies—publication includes Foundation acknowledgment, university news office covers, links to Foundation)

**Realistic Expectation**: 20-30 links over 5 years (partnerships make this achievable—Foundation has built-in connections)

---

### Tier 3: Patient Advocacy Organizations (Medium Value, High Relevance)

**Target Sites**:

- COPD Foundation (copdfoundation.org—related disease, cross-link)
- American Lung Association (lung.org—Foundation joins as member organization, gets directory link)
- Genetic Alliance (geneticalliance.org—rare disease umbrella, Foundation member)
- NORD (rarediseases.org—National Organization for Rare Disorders, Foundation listed in database)

**How to Earn Links**:

1. **Reciprocal resources** (COPD Foundation links to Foundation's AATD guide, Foundation links to COPD Foundation's general COPD resources—mutual benefit)
2. **Coalition membership** (join Genetic Alliance—automatic link from member directory)
3. **Cross-promotion** (guest blog on American Lung blog—"Understanding Alpha-1, a Genetic Cause of Lung Disease," includes author bio with link)

**Realistic Expectation**: 30-50 links over 5 years (easier to earn than Tier 1/2, still valuable for relevance)

---

### Tier 4: News & Media Coverage (Variable Value, High Traffic)

**Target Outlets**:

- Local news (TV stations, newspapers—human interest stories, patient profiles)
- Health/science journalists (Stat News, MedPage Today—research announcements)
- National media (CNN Health, NBC News—rare disease awareness, Foundation spokespeople)

**How to Earn Links**:

1. **Press releases** (Foundation milestones—"30,000 Patients Diagnosed Through 23andMe Partnership," newsworthy, journalists pick up)
2. **Expert commentary** (journalists writing AATD article—Foundation provides expert [Board member, medical advisor], gets cited + linked)
3. **Patient stories** (human interest—"38-Year-Old Mom Diagnosed with Rare Genetic Disease, Now Advocating," local news covers, links to Foundation)

**Realistic Expectation**: 50-100 links over 5 years (media coverage variable—some stories go viral, others ignored, but combined significant)

---

### Tier 5: High-DA General Sites (Lower Relevance, Still Valuable)

**Target Sites**:

- Wikipedia (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-1_antitrypsin_deficiency—DA 95, no-follow links but still valuable for traffic, credibility)
- Charity Navigator (charitynavigator.org—Foundation gets rated, profile includes link)
- GuideStar (guidestar.org—nonprofit database, automatic link)

**How to Earn Links**:

1. **Edit Wikipedia** (Foundation staff edits AATD Wikipedia page—add Foundation to "External Links" section, cite Foundation resources in article, follow Wikipedia guidelines [neutral, cite sources])
2. **Get rated** (apply to Charity Navigator, GuideStar—automatic profile + link once Foundation has 3+ years of financials)

**Realistic Expectation**: 10-20 links over 5 years (mostly directories, easy to earn)

---

### Link Building Tactics (Specific Actions)

**Tactic 1: Resource Pages** (Low-Hanging Fruit)

- Find pages like "AATD Resources" on medical sites (Google: "alpha-1 resources" + "inurl:links" or "inurl:resources")
- Email site owners—"Hi, I manage MarkEglyFoundation.org. I noticed your AATD resources page. We've created comprehensive patient guide. Would you consider adding us?"
- **Success Rate**: 10-20% (many ignore, but some add—send 100 emails, get 10-20 links)

**Tactic 2: Broken Link Building** (Win-Win)

- Find broken links on medical sites (Ahrefs tool—scan sites for 404s)
- If broken link is to old AATD resource—email site owner: "Hi, your AATD page has broken link to [dead site]. We have similar resource at [Foundation link]. Happy to replace?"
- **Success Rate**: 20-30% (site owners appreciate fix—easy yes)
