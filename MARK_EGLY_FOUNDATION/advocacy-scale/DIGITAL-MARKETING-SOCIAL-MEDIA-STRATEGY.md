## Digital Marketing Landscape

### Multi-Channel Approach

**Foundation's Digital Ecosystem**:

- **Owned Media** (Website, email list, social profiles—Foundation controls 100%)
- **Earned Media** (Press coverage, shares, word-of-mouth—credibility, no cost)
- **Paid Media** (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, influencer sponsorships—scale, targeting)

**Why Digital Marketing + SEO?**:

- ✅ **SEO = Long-term** (takes 12-18 months—ranks #1, free traffic forever, slow build)
- ✅ **Paid = Immediate** (launch campaign today—traffic tomorrow, fast results, but costs continue)
- ✅ **Combined = Optimal** (paid drives traffic while SEO builds—Year 1 60% paid / 40% organic → Year 5 30% paid / 70% organic, shift over time)

---

### Target Audiences (Different Platforms, Different Audiences)

**Audience 1: Undiagnosed Patients (Priority #1)**

- **Who**: 90,000 Americans with AATD symptoms (early COPD, liver disease—don't know it's genetic)
- **Where They Are**: Google (searching "COPD at 35," "why emphysema non-smoker"), Facebook (COPD groups, lung health pages)
- **Foundation's Goal**: Intercept searches, target ads → drive to symptom checker → get tested → diagnosed
- **Platforms**: Google Ads (search), Facebook Ads (audience targeting), YouTube (pre-roll on COPD videos)

---

**Audience 2: Diagnosed Patients (Community Building)**

- **Who**: 10,000-20,000 diagnosed AATD patients (need support, education, connection)
- **Where They Are**: Facebook groups ("Alpha-1 Support"), Instagram (#Alpha1Warrior hashtag), patient forums
- **Foundation's Goal**: Build community → support groups, patient navigation, advocacy → lifelong engagement (donors, volunteers)
- **Platforms**: Facebook (groups, pages), Instagram (stories, patient spotlights), YouTube (education videos)

---

**Audience 3: Healthcare Professionals (Diagnosis Enablers)**

- **Who**: Primary care physicians, pulmonologists, hepatologists (can order testing—need education)
- **Where They Are**: LinkedIn (professional network), Medscape (CME), medical journals (online ads)
- **Foundation's Goal**: Educate → test more patients → increase diagnosis → Foundation's ultimate goal
- **Platforms**: LinkedIn Ads (target "pulmonologist," "primary care"), retargeting (website visitors—HCP section)

---

**Audience 4: Donors (Revenue)**

- **Who**: Philanthropists, AATD families, empathetic individuals (care about rare disease—willing to give)
- **Where They Are**: Facebook (nonprofit followers), Instagram (cause-driven), email (newsletter subscribers)
- **Foundation's Goal**: Inspire giving → donations → fund programs, research → mission fulfillment
- **Platforms**: Facebook/Instagram Ads (lookalike audiences—past donors), email campaigns (segmented), retargeting (website visitors who didn't donate)

---

## Platform Strategy

### Platform 1: Facebook (Community Hub)

**Why Facebook?**

- ✅ **Largest user base** (2.9B users—everyone's on Facebook, patients age 40-70 especially active)
- ✅ **Groups** (private communities—patients share experiences, support each other, Foundation moderates)
- ✅ **Targeted ads** (hyper-specific—target "COPD," "emphysema," "lung disease," geographic, age, behaviors)
- ✅ **Fundraising tools** (birthday fundraisers, donation buttons—easy peer-to-peer, integrated)

**Foundation's Facebook Presence**:

**1. Mark Egly Foundation Page** (Public, Brand Presence)

- **Content**: Educational posts (2-3/week—"What is Alpha-1?", treatment tips, research updates), patient stories (1/week—video or text), event announcements (Walk, Gala, webinars)
- **Goal**: 10K followers Year 1 → 50K followers Year 5 (broad awareness, SEO benefit [social signals])
- **Engagement Strategy**: Ask questions ("Have you been tested for Alpha-1?"), polls ("Which symptom brought you to diagnosis?"), encourage comments (respond within 24 hours—build relationships)

**2. Alpha-1 Community Group** (Private, Patient Support)

- **Content**: Peer support (patients post questions—"Just diagnosed, scared, advice?"), Foundation staff moderate (answer questions, share resources, no misinformation), weekly themes (Monday Motivation [inspiring quotes], Wednesday Wisdom [medical info], Friday Spotlight [member story])
- **Goal**: 500 members Year 1 → 5,000 members Year 5 (largest private AATD community—competitive with existing groups)
- **Moderation**: 3 rules (1. Be kind/supportive—no negativity, 2. No medical advice—encourage doctor consultations, 3. Privacy—don't share others' info), Foundation staff monitors daily (remove spam, answer questions)

**Facebook Ads Strategy**:

- **Campaign 1: Awareness** (Target: Undiagnosed patients, Budget: $2K/month = $24K/year)
  - Audience: Age 30-65, interests: COPD, emphysema, lung disease, liver disease, genetic testing
  - Ad creative: "Have COPD but never smoked? It could be Alpha-1. Take our 2-minute quiz." (link to symptom checker)
  - Expected results: 500K impressions/month, 5K clicks (1% CTR), 500 symptom checker completions (10% conversion), 75 high-risk (15%)—$24K / 900 high-risk leads/year = $27/lead (cost-effective)

- **Campaign 2: Retargeting** (Target: Website visitors who didn't convert, Budget: $500/month = $6K/year)
  - Audience: Visited Foundation website (read articles, watched videos—engaged but didn't join group, donate, or find specialist)
  - Ad creative: "Come back! Join our community of Alpha-1 warriors" (link to Facebook group), "Find a specialist near you" (link to directory)
  - Expected results: 50K impressions/month, 1K clicks (2% CTR—warm audience), 100 conversions (10%—support group signups, specialist searches)

- **Campaign 3: Fundraising** (Target: Lookalike donors, Budget: $1K/month = $12K/year)
  - Audience: Lookalike of past donors (Facebook finds similar users—demographics, interests, behaviors match Foundation's donor profile)
  - Ad creative: Patient testimonial video ("Alpha-1 gave me emphysema at 38. The Foundation saved my life. Please donate."), donate button
  - Expected results: 100K impressions/month, 2K clicks (2% CTR), 60 donations (3% conversion, $100 avg.) = $6K/month revenue ($72K/year revenue from $12K ad spend = 6:1 ROI—excellent)

**Total Facebook Ads Budget**: $42K/year (Year 1)

---

### Platform 2: Instagram (Visual Storytelling)

**Why Instagram?**

- ✅ **Visual medium** (photos, videos, stories—perfect for patient faces, humanize AATD)
- ✅ **Younger audience** (skews 25-45—reach newly diagnosed, family members, younger demographics than Facebook)
- ✅ **Influencer ecosystem** (health/fitness influencers—partner for reach, credibility)
- ✅ **Hashtags** (discoverability—#Alpha1Warrior, #RareDisease, #LungHealth reach beyond followers)

**Foundation's Instagram Strategy**:

**Content Mix** (Daily Posts):

- **Monday: Motivation** (quote graphic—"You're stronger than Alpha-1," patient photo, inspirational)
- **Tuesday: Education** (carousel post—"5 Facts About Alpha-1," swipe through facts, infographic-style)
- **Wednesday: Patient Spotlight** (photo of patient + caption—"Meet John, diagnosed 5 years ago, now marathon runner," humanize)
- **Thursday: Behind-the-Scenes** (Foundation staff, events, research lab visits—transparency, connection)
- **Friday: Community** (user-generated content—repost patient photos with permission, "Shoutout to @AlphaWarriorSarah," build community)
- **Saturday: Events** (Walk photos, Gala highlights, webinar reminders—drive participation)
- **Sunday: Rest or Throwback** (optional post—#TBT patient story, or skip [algorithm okay with 6/7 days])

**Stories** (Daily, 24-Hour Content):

- Poll stickers ("Have you been tested for Alpha-1? Yes/No"—engagement)
- Q&A stickers ("Ask us anything about Alpha-1"—Foundation answers, builds trust)
- Countdown stickers ("10 days until Breathe Easy Walk!"—event hype)
- Behind-the-scenes (staff day-in-the-life, conference footage—authentic, relatable)

**Reels** (Short Video, 3-5/month):

- Patient stories (30-second testimonial—"I'm 40, I have Alpha-1, here's my story," TikTok-style, attention-grabbing)
- Education (15-second explainers—"What is Alpha-1 in 15 seconds," fast-paced, music, captions)
- Awareness (challenges—"#BreathForAlpha1 Challenge," patients post lung health tips, tag Foundation, viral potential)

**Instagram Ads** (Budget: $1.5K/month = $18K/year):

- **Campaign 1: Influencer Amplification** (Boost influencer posts—health/fitness influencers with AATD or personal connection, sponsored post reaches their followers + Foundation's paid audience)
- **Campaign 2: Story Ads** (Immersive—full-screen patient testimonial, "Swipe Up to Learn More," link to Foundation quiz)
- Expected results: 300K impressions/month, 6K clicks (2% CTR), 600 quiz completions (10%)—$18K / 7,200 engaged users/year = $2.50/engagement (very cost-effective for awareness)

**Goal**: 5K followers Year 1 → 30K followers Year 5 (smaller than Facebook—Instagram harder to grow organically for nonprofits, but higher engagement rate)

---

### Platform 3: YouTube (Long-Form Education)

**Why YouTube?**

- ✅ **Second-largest search engine** (after Google—patients search "what is alpha-1," YouTube videos rank #1)
- ✅ **Long-form content** (10-30 minute videos—in-depth education, webinars, patient stories full-length)
- ✅ **Evergreen** (videos rank for years—2025 video still driving traffic in 2030, SEO benefit)
- ✅ **Monetization potential** (once 1K subscribers + 4K watch hours—YouTube pays Foundation for ads on videos, small but nice)

**Foundation's YouTube Content**:

**Series 1: "Understanding Alpha-1"** (Education, 10-15 minutes each, 20 videos)

- "What is Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency?" (most important video—rank #1 for keyword, comprehensive, animated diagrams)
- "AATD Genetics: How It's Inherited" (Punnett squares, family planning, genetic counselor explains)
- "Lung Disease in Alpha-1" (emphysema, bronchiectasis, CT scans shown, pulmonologist explains)
- "Liver Disease in Alpha-1" (underserved topic—hepatologist explains, rank #1 "alpha-1 liver disease")
- [16 more educational videos—treatment, testing, living with AATD, etc.]

**Series 2: "Patient Stories"** (Testimonials, 5-10 minutes, 30 videos over 5 years)

- "Sarah's Story: Diagnosed at 38" (diagnosis journey, emotional, relatable—viewed 10K+ times, shared widely)
- "John's Story: Living with Alpha-1 for 15 Years" (long-term perspective, hopeful—patients see future)
- [28 more patient stories—diversity of age, severity, geography, representation]

**Series 3: "Ask the Expert"** (Q&A, 20-30 minutes, monthly)

- Foundation's medical advisors answer questions (submitted via social media, email—"Can I have kids with Alpha-1?", "Is augmentation therapy worth it?")
- Livestreamed (engagement—viewers comment live, Foundation responds real-time), saved as VOD (on-demand viewing, SEO)

**Series 4: "Webinar Recordings"** (Full webinars, 60 minutes, quarterly)

- "Gene Therapy Update 2026" (researcher presents latest trials—AGTC, Beam, Moderna, patient Q&A)
- "Navigating Insurance for Augmentation Therapy" (billing expert explains—pre-authorization, appeals, Foundation resource)

**YouTube Ads** (Budget: $1K/month = $12K/year):

- **Pre-roll ads** (play before COPD/lung health videos—"Have COPD? It could be genetic. Learn about Alpha-1.")
- **Discovery ads** (appear in search results—user searches "emphysema young age," Foundation ad appears, clicks to "Understanding Alpha-1" video)
- Expected results: 500K views/year (paid + organic), 5K channel subscribers Year 1 → 25K Year 5

**Goal**: 10K subscribers Year 5 (YouTube slow growth for nonprofits, but valuable—1K watch hours = monetization eligibility, Foundation earns $500-$2K/year from YouTube ads on own videos, small passive income)

---

### Platform 4: LinkedIn (Professional Network)

**Why LinkedIn?**

- ✅ **B2B focus** (corporate partnerships, employer giving—target HR, CSR directors)
- ✅ **Healthcare professionals** (pulmonologists, physicians—educate, drive testing)
- ✅ **Thought leadership** (Foundation executives post—establish authority, credibility)

**Foundation's LinkedIn Strategy**:

**Company Page** (Mark Egly Foundation):

- **Content**: Research updates (2/month—"Foundation funds $500K gene therapy study"), job postings (hiring—Community Manager, Development Director, transparency), corporate partnership opportunities (1/month—"Partner with us for employee giving campaign")
- **Goal**: 2K followers Year 1 → 10K Year 5 (smaller than Facebook/Instagram—LinkedIn audiences smaller, but high-value [donors, professionals])

**Executive Profiles** (CEO, CMO, Chief Science Officer):

- **Content**: Thought leadership posts (CEO writes—"Why AATD diagnosis matters," "The future of rare disease advocacy," personal voice, humanizes Foundation), share Foundation content (amplify reach—CEO shares, their network sees, Foundation page grows)
- **Goal**: Each executive 1K+ connections (network effect—Foundation reaches 10K+ professionals through executives)

**LinkedIn Ads** (Budget: $1K/month = $12K/year):

- **Campaign 1: HCP Education** (Target: Pulmonologists, primary care physicians [job titles], Ad: "Free CME: AATD Diagnosis & Management," link to Foundation CME course)
- **Campaign 2: Corporate Partnerships** (Target: HR Directors, CSR Managers [job titles], Ad: "Partner with Mark Egly Foundation for employee giving," link to corporate partnerships page)
- Expected results: 100K impressions/year, 1K clicks (1% CTR—professional audience, lower CTR than Facebook), 100 conversions (CME enrollments, partnership inquiries—high-value, worth $120/conversion)

---

### Platform 5: Twitter/X (Real-Time Engagement)

**Why Twitter?**

- ✅ **News & advocacy** (journalists on Twitter—Foundation shares research, policy updates, gets media pickup)
- ✅ **Real-time** (live-tweet events—conferences, Walk, Gala, engage attendees)
- ⚠️ **Declining engagement** (Twitter usage down post-2023 changes—lower priority for Foundation, maintain presence but don't invest heavily)

**Foundation's Twitter Strategy** (Minimal Investment):

- **Content**: Retweet patient stories, share research papers (link to Foundation blog post), live-tweet events (Annual Conference—"Dr. Sandhaus presenting on gene therapy now #AATDConf26"), advocacy calls-to-action ("Tell Congress to fund AATD research, link in bio")
- **Frequency**: 3-5 tweets/week (lower than Facebook/Instagram—Twitter not primary audience)
- **Goal**: 3K followers Year 5 (maintain presence, low effort, don't ignore but don't prioritize)

**No Twitter Ads** (Not cost-effective—Foundation focuses budget on Facebook, Google, LinkedIn where ROI proven)

---

## Paid Advertising

### Google Ads (Search + Display)

**Why Google Ads?**

- ✅ **High intent** (searchers actively looking—"COPD young age," "alpha-1 testing," ready to engage)
- ✅ **Immediate visibility** (SEO takes months—Google Ads instant #1 position, while SEO builds)
- ✅ **Granular targeting** (keywords, location, device—precise audience)

**Google Ads Budget**: $50K/year (Year 1), $30K/year (Year 5—decrease as SEO improves, less paid needed)

---

**Campaign 1: Search Ads - Undiagnosed Patients** ($30K/year)

**Keywords** (High Intent):

- "COPD at young age" (CPC $3-$5—competitive, worth it)
- "emphysema never smoked" (CPC $2-$4)
- "genetic lung disease" (CPC $4-$6)
- "why do I have COPD" (CPC $2-$3—long-tail, cheaper)
- "alpha-1 testing" (CPC $5-$8—expensive but direct intent, patient ready to test)

**Ad Example**:

```
Headline 1: "Have COPD But Never Smoked?"
Headline 2: "It Could Be Alpha-1 Deficiency"
Description: "Take our free 2-minute quiz to assess your risk. Alpha-1 is a genetic cause of COPD. Get tested today."
URL: MarkEglyFoundation.org/Quiz
```

**Landing Page**: Symptom checker (quiz—10 questions, submit, get result "High risk—recommend testing," capture email, follow up)

**Expected Results**:

- Impressions: 500K/year
- Clicks: 5K (1% CTR—good for search)
- Quiz completions: 2.5K (50% conversion—engaged audience)
- High-risk results: 500 (20%—these are undiagnosed patients, Foundation's primary target)
- Cost per high-risk lead: $60 ($30K / 500)—reasonable for patient acquisition

---

**Campaign 2: Search Ads - Healthcare Professionals** ($10K/year)

**Keywords**:

- "AATD testing guidelines" (CPC $4-$6)
- "when to test for alpha-1" (CPC $3-$5)
- "alpha-1 CME" (CPC $5-$8—physicians searching for education, high value)

**Ad Example**:

```
Headline 1: "Free CME: Alpha-1 Diagnosis"
Headline 2: "1.0 Credit - Online Course"
Description: "Learn when to test for AATD, how to interpret results, and patient management. Free for physicians."
URL: MarkEglyFoundation.org/CME
```

**Landing Page**: CME course registration (physicians sign up, take 1-hour course, earn credit, Foundation educates 1,000 physicians/year → they test more patients → diagnosis increases)

**Expected Results**:

- Clicks: 1K
- CME enrollments: 300 (30% conversion)
- Cost per physician educated: $33 ($10K / 300)—incredibly cost-effective (each physician may diagnose 1-3 patients over career, 300 physicians × 2 patients = 600 future diagnoses attributable to Foundation's ad spend)

---

**Campaign 3: Display Ads - Retargeting** ($10K/year)

**Audience**: Website visitors (read articles, watched videos—engaged but didn't convert [join group, donate, find specialist])

**Ad Creative**: Banner ads (300x250, 728x90—"Join our Alpha-1 community," "Find a specialist near you," patient photos, Foundation logo)

**Placements**: Google Display Network (millions of websites—news, medical sites, patient forums, Foundation ads follow visitors across web)

**Expected Results**:

- Impressions: 2M/year (display = high impressions, low CTR)
- Clicks: 10K (0.5% CTR—typical for display)
- Conversions: 500 (5%—support group signups, donations, specialist searches)
- Cost per conversion: $20 ($10K / 500)—very cost-effective for retargeting

---

### Facebook/Instagram Ads (Detailed Above)

**Total Social Ads Budget**: $60K/year (Facebook $42K + Instagram $18K)

**Why Social Ads Effective?**

- ✅ **Audience targeting** (interests, behaviors—"COPD," "lung disease," "genetic testing," reach undiagnosed without them actively searching)
- ✅ **Visual storytelling** (video ads—patient testimonials, 30-second stories, emotional, drive engagement)
- ✅ **Retargeting** (Facebook Pixel—track website visitors, retarget with ads, 2x-3x conversion vs. cold audience)
- ✅ **Lookalike audiences** (upload Foundation's donor list—Facebook finds similar users, expand reach to high-potential donors)

---

## Social Media Organic

### Content Themes (Consistent Across Platforms)

**Monday: Motivation Monday**

- Inspirational quote (patient quote—"Alpha-1 doesn't define me, I define Alpha-1," or Mark Egly quote)
- Patient photo (smiling, active—convey hope)
- **Goal**: Engagement (likes, shares—feel-good content, algorithm favors, increases reach)

**Tuesday: Education Tuesday**

- AATD fact (carousel post—"5 Things You Didn't Know About Alpha-1," swipe through)
- Link to blog article (drive website traffic—"Learn more [link]")
- **Goal**: Education (establish Foundation as authority, SEO benefit from social shares)

**Wednesday: Patient Spotlight Wednesday**

- Feature patient (photo + story—"Meet Maria, diagnosed 3 years ago, now volunteers with Foundation")
- Humanize AATD (faces, not statistics—connection, community)
- **Goal**: Community building (patients see themselves, feel represented, engage)

**Thursday: Research Thursday**

- Research update (Foundation-funded study, clinical trial news, scientific breakthrough—"Gene therapy trial shows promise")
- Credibility (Foundation serious about science—attracts donors, researchers)
- **Goal**: Thought leadership (Foundation = scientific authority)

**Friday: Community Friday**

- User-generated content (repost patient photos—"Shoutout to @JohnAlpha1Warrior," tag patients, encourage posts)
- Support group highlight ("Join our Denver support group, meets 2nd Tuesday," local engagement)
- **Goal**: Virality (patients share, tag friends—organic reach, community growth)

**Saturday: Event Saturday**

- Event photos (Walk, Gala, webinar screenshots—"Amazing turnout at Chicago Walk!")
- Event reminders ("2 weeks until registration closes—sign up now!")
- **Goal**: Event participation (drive registrations, attendance, fundraising)

**Sunday: Rest or #SundayFunday**

- Optional post (lighthearted—"What are you doing this Sunday? We're resting up for another week of fighting Alpha-1!")
- Or skip (algorithm okay with 6/7 days—staff need rest too)

---

### Engagement Tactics

**Respond to Every Comment** (Within 24 Hours):

- Patient comments ("Just diagnosed, scared"—Foundation responds: "We're here for you! Check your DMs, we'll connect you to a Navigator.")
- Questions ("Is augmentation therapy covered by insurance?"—Foundation answers or links to resource)
- **Why**: Builds trust (patients feel heard, valued—lifelong loyalty), algorithm boost (engagement signals to Facebook/Instagram—"This post is popular," shows to more people)

**Ask Questions** (Drive Comments):

- "What's one thing you wish people knew about Alpha-1?" (patients comment stories—100+ comments, algorithm loves)
- "Poll: Have you been tested for Alpha-1? React 👍 for Yes, ❤️ for No" (simple, everyone can participate, high engagement)

**Host Live Q&As** (Monthly):

- Facebook Live (30 minutes—Foundation medical advisor answers questions, "Ask me anything about Alpha-1")
- Announce 1 week ahead ("Submit your questions in comments, we'll answer live next Friday 3pm ET")
- Save as video (after live—post to YouTube, blog, evergreen content)

**Run Contests** (Quarterly):

- "Share your Alpha-1 story, tag 3 friends—winner gets Foundation swag + $100 donation in your name" (viral potential, patient engagement, friend tagging = reach new audiences)

---

## Influencer Partnerships

### Why Influencers?

**Reach New Audiences**:

- Foundation's organic reach limited (5K Instagram followers—posts reach 500-1K people [10-20% organic reach])
- Influencer with 100K followers—post reaches 10K-20K (10x Foundation's reach)
- **Partnership model**: Influencer posts about AATD—"I have Alpha-1, here's my story, support @MarkEglyFoundation"—their followers discover Foundation, Foundation gains followers, donations, awareness

---

### Tier 1: Macro-Influencers (100K-1M Followers, Aspirational)

**Target Influencers**:

- **Health/Fitness Influencers with AATD** (rare but powerful—if Foundation finds fitness influencer diagnosed with AATD, they become spokesperson, huge reach)
- **Celebrity Patients** (actors, athletes with AATD—like Michael J. Fox for Parkinson's, Foundation needs "face of AATD")

**Partnership Approach**:

- Identify (Google: "celebrity with alpha-1," search AATD forums for public figures, social media hashtags)
- Reach out (DM, email—"We're Mark Egly Foundation, would you consider partnering with us?")
- Offer (no payment—nonprofits can't pay celebrities, but: Honorary Board position, spotlight at Gala, co-branded campaign, ego + altruism motivators)

**Realistic Expectation**: 1-2 macro-influencer partnerships over 5 years (difficult—AATD rare, fewer celebrities than Parkinson's/ALS, but possible)

**Impact**: 1 macro-influencer post (100K followers) = 10K-20K engagements, 500-1K new Foundation followers, $5K-$10K in donations (single post—huge ROI for zero cost)

---

### Tier 2: Micro-Influencers (10K-100K Followers, Attainable)

**Target Influencers**:

- **AATD patients** (already diagnosed, active on Instagram—"Alpha-1 Warrior" in bio, posts about health journey, 10K-50K followers)
- **Health advocates** (chronic illness influencers—not AATD-specific, but lung health, rare disease, 20K-100K followers)
- **Medical professionals** (pulmonologists, respiratory therapists on Instagram—educational content, 15K-50K followers, credibility)

**Partnership Approach**:

- Identify (Instagram hashtags—#Alpha1Warrior, #RareDiseaseAdvocate, #PulmonaryRehab, scroll, find active posters)
- Reach out (DM—"Hi! We're Mark Egly Foundation. Love your Alpha-1 content. Would you partner with us for AATD Awareness Month?")
- Offer ($500-$2K per post—micro-influencers charge, typical rates: 10K followers = $100-$500/post, 50K followers = $500-$2K/post, Foundation negotiates, often donate portion back [tax deduction])

**Partnerships** (Year 1: 5 micro-influencers, Year 5: 20):

- Sponsored posts (influencer posts—photo of Foundation T-shirt, "I'm proud to partner with @MarkEglyFoundation, here's why Alpha-1 matters to me," link in bio)
- Takeovers (influencer runs Foundation's Instagram for a day—posts stories, responds to comments, humanizes Foundation, their followers discover)
- Ambassador program (ongoing—influencer posts quarterly about Foundation, annual stipend $2K-$5K, long-term relationship)

**Expected Results** (5 micro-influencers × 4 posts/year):

- Reach: 20 posts × 30K avg. followers × 10% reach = 60K impressions
- Engagement: 20 posts × 1K engagements = 20K (likes, comments, shares)
- New followers: 500 (incremental—some influencer followers follow Foundation)
- Donations: $10K (influencer audiences give—$500/post avg., 20 posts = $10K revenue from $10K spend = 1:1 ROI, plus awareness value)

**Cost**: $10K/year (5 influencers × $2K/year = $10K—affordable, high reach)

---

### Tier 3: Nano-Influencers (1K-10K Followers, Grassroots)

**Target Influencers**:

- **AATD patients** (smaller followings—but highly engaged, personal connections, authentic)
- **Foundation volunteers** (already involved—support group leaders, Walk participants, passionate advocates)

**Partnership Approach**:

- Recruit from community (Foundation's support groups—"Who's active on Instagram? Would you post about Foundation?")
- No payment (volunteers—happy to help, altruistic, provide Foundation swag [T-shirt, water bottle], recognition [feature on Foundation page])

**Partnerships** (Year 1: 20 nano-influencers, Year 5: 100):

- Organic posts (nano-influencers post naturally—"Attended @MarkEglyFoundation Walk today, amazing!," no scripted, authentic)
- Hashtag campaigns ("#BreathForAlpha1 Challenge"—Foundation creates challenge, nano-influencers participate, tag friends, viral potential)

**Expected Results** (20 nano-influencers × 10 posts/year):

- Reach: 200 posts × 3K avg. followers × 20% reach = 120K impressions (nano-influencers = higher engagement % than macro)
- New followers: 200 (incremental)
- Community building (nano-influencers = grassroots, authentic, Foundation feels like movement, not corporation)

**Cost**: $2K/year (Foundation swag, shipping—minimal, high ROI)

---

## Email Marketing

### Foundation's Most Valuable Asset: Email List

**Why Email Underrated?**

- ✅ **Owned audience** (Foundation controls—Facebook algorithm changes, email list stays, direct access)
- ✅ **High ROI** ($42 return per $1 spent—email marketing highest ROI of any channel, DMA study)
- ✅ **Permission-based** (subscribers opted in—engaged audience, want Foundation's content, open rates 20-30% [nonprofit average])

**Email List Growth**:

- Year 1: 2,000 subscribers (website popups, event registrations, support group signups—every interaction = email capture)
- Year 5: 15,000 subscribers (7.5x growth—list = Foundation's most valuable asset, 15K emails × $5/email lifetime value = $75K asset value)

---

### Email Segmentation (Different Audiences, Different Content)

**Segment 1: Patients** (5,000 by Year 5)

- **Content**: Support resources (new articles, webinars, support group events), treatment updates (gene therapy news, clinical trials), community spotlights (patient stories, "You're not alone")
- **Frequency**: Bi-weekly (every 2 weeks—not too frequent [avoid unsubscribes], not too rare [stay top-of-mind])
- **Goal**: Engagement (patients feel supported—lifelong loyalty, donors, advocates)

**Segment 2: Healthcare Professionals** (2,000 by Year 5)

- **Content**: Clinical updates (new research, guidelines, CME opportunities), diagnosis tools (testing protocols, specialist directory), case studies (learning opportunities)
- **Frequency**: Monthly (physicians busy—less frequent, high-value content only)
- **Goal**: Education (physicians test more patients—Foundation's ultimate goal)

**Segment 3: Donors** (3,000 by Year 5)

- **Content**: Impact stories ("Your donation funded this research," "Meet the patient you helped"), funding needs ("We're $50K short of gene therapy grant—can you help?"), event invitations (Gala, exclusive donor webinars)
- **Frequency**: Monthly (donors want updates—show impact, stewardship, encourage repeat gifts)
- **Goal**: Retention (80% donor retention—industry average 40-50%, email stewardship doubles retention)

**Segment 4: General Subscribers** (5,000 by Year 5)

- **Content**: Mix (educational articles, events, calls-to-action [join support group, donate, volunteer]—nurture until they self-segment [become patient, donor, etc.])
- **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Goal**: Conversion (move from general interest to engaged—patient, donor, volunteer)

---

### Email Campaigns (Types)

**1. Welcome Series** (Automated, Triggered on Signup)

- Email 1 (immediate): "Welcome to Mark Egly Foundation!" (intro, who we are, what we do, call-to-action [watch "What is Alpha-1?" video])
- Email 2 (3 days later): "Get to Know Alpha-1" (link to 5 essential articles, quiz, resources)
- Email 3 (7 days later): "How You Can Help" (donate, volunteer, share, engage—conversion ask)

**Conversion Rate**: 15-20% of welcome series recipients take action (donate, join group, find specialist—automated nurture converts)

---

**2. Monthly Newsletter** (Sent to All)

  - Hero story (patient spotlight—650 words, photo, emotional)
  - Research update (100 words—"Foundation funds $500K gene therapy study, learn more [link]")
  - Event highlight (100 words—"Register for Walk, early-bird pricing ends soon [link]")
  - Call-to-action (donate button—"Support our mission [donate]")
- **Open Rate Target**: 25-30% (nonprofit average 25%—Foundation's engaged audience, personal content, achievable)
- **Click Rate Target**: 3-5% (industry average 2.5%—compelling links, clear CTAs, beat average)

---

**4. Re-engagement Campaign** (Automated, Triggered After 6 Months Inactivity)

- Email 1: "We miss you! Here's what you've missed" (summary of last 6 months—research, patients helped, events)
- Email 2: "What content do you want?" (survey—feedback, preferences, improve emails)
- Email 3: "Last chance—update preferences or unsubscribe" (final attempt—if no response, remove from list [healthy list hygiene, improves deliverability])

| --------------------------- | ------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |

---

## Metrics & KPIs

### North Star Metric: **Patient Diagnosis Rate**

**Foundation's Ultimate Goal**: Increase US AATD diagnosis rate from 10% → 50% over 10 years

**Digital Marketing Contribution**:

- Convert to testing (50% of high-risk complete testing—Year 1: 500, Year 5: 2,500)
- Confirmed diagnoses (15% of tests positive—Year 1: 75, Year 5: 375 **new diagnoses directly attributable to digital marketing**)

**Cost per diagnosis**: Year 1: $140K / 75 = $1,867/diagnosis, Year 5: $180K / 375 = $480/diagnosis (efficiency improves 4x—SEO + word-of-mouth compound)

- Email list 15K (5K net new—slowing growth but highly engaged)
- Reach 85K social followers (15K net new)
