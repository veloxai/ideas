## The Data Gap in AATD Research

### Why AATD Research is Data-Starved

**The Problem**:

- **Small patient population** (100,000 US patients—rare disease, limited research subjects)
- **Fragmented care** (patients see different doctors, different hospitals—data siloed, no unified view)
- **Research barriers** (recruiting patients = slow/expensive, clinical trials take 3-5 years to enroll 100 patients)
- **Lack of natural history data** (researchers don't know typical disease progression—makes trials harder to design, interpret)

**Current State**:

- AlphaNet registry: ~3,000 patients (3% of diagnosed US patients)
- Alpha-1 Foundation registry: ~1,000 patients (1%)
- Academic registries combined: ~2,000 patients (fragmented, not shared)
- **Total**: ~5,000 patients with registry data (5% of diagnosed, 0.05% of all AATD patients—researchers starved for data)

---

### Foundation's Opportunity: Build World's Largest AATD Database

**Vision**: 10,000-patient registry by Year 10 (10% of all US AATD patients—10x larger than any existing registry)

**How Data Donation Enables Research**:

**1. Natural History Studies** (Understand Disease Progression)

- Current gap: "How fast does lung function decline in Pi*ZZ vs. Pi*SZ?" (unclear—limited data)
- With data: Track 5,000 Pi\*ZZ patients over 10 years (FEV1 measurements, exacerbations, hospitalizations—definitive answer)
- **Impact**: Researchers design better trials (know expected decline rate—calculate sample sizes, trial durations accurately)

**2. Treatment Effectiveness** (Real-World Evidence)

- Current gap: "Does augmentation therapy work long-term?" (clinical trials = 2-3 years, real world = 20+ years, data gap)
- With data: Compare 2,000 patients on augmentation vs. 2,000 not on therapy (matched for age, severity, smoking—observational study)
- **Impact**: Prove therapy works (or doesn't)—influence insurance coverage, FDA, patient decisions

**3. Genotype-Phenotype Correlations** (Precision Medicine)

- Current gap: "Why do some Pi\*ZZ patients have severe lung disease at 40, others mild at 70?" (genetic modifiers unknown)
- With data: Whole genome sequence 1,000 patients (identify protective genes, risk genes—personalize treatment)
- **Impact**: Predict who needs aggressive therapy, who can wait (precision medicine—right treatment, right patient, right time)

**4. Clinical Trial Acceleration** (Faster Drug Development)

- Current gap: Recruiting 100 patients for gene therapy trial = 3 years (expensive, delays cure)
- With data: Foundation registry = trial-ready patients (pre-screened, pre-consented, contact in database—recruit 100 in 3 months, not 3 years)
- **Impact**: Gene therapy approved 2 years faster (2032 vs. 2034—thousands of patients benefit sooner)

## What Patients Can Donate

### Tier 1: Basic Data (Every Participant)

**Demographics** (No PHI—De-identified):

- Age (year of birth, not exact birthdate—balance utility + privacy)
- Sex (male/female/other—biological sex for research, not gender identity here)
- Race/ethnicity (important—AATD prevalence varies, Northern European highest)
- Geographic region (state or ZIP first 3 digits—track environmental exposures, access to care, not exact address)

**Genetic Data** (Foundation's Most Valuable Asset):

- SERPINA1 genotype (Pi*ZZ, Pi*SZ, Pi\*MZ, rare variants—definitive diagnosis)
- Full sequence if available (whole SERPINA1 gene—identify novel mutations, improve diagnostics)
- Whole genome optional (patients can opt in—23andMe raw data, clinical sequencing, advanced research)

**Medical History**:

- AATD symptoms (lung disease, liver disease, panniculitis, age of onset—natural history)
- Comorbidities (COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis, cirrhosis—disease overlap, treatment implications)
- Medications (augmentation therapy brand/frequency, inhalers, liver meds—treatment patterns)
- Smoking history (never/former/current, pack-years—#1 risk factor, essential variable)

**Family History**:

- First-degree relatives with AATD (yes/no, how many—genetic counseling, cascade screening data)
- Family members diagnosed after index patient (measure cascade screening success—Foundation's impact)

---

### Tier 2: Clinical Data (Engaged Participants, Annual Updates)

**Lung Function Tests** (Gold Standard Outcomes):

- FEV1 (forced expiratory volume—primary COPD outcome, track annually)
- FVC (forced vital capacity)
- DLCO (diffusion capacity—gas exchange, sensitive measure)
- **Why valuable**: Researchers track disease progression (FEV1 decline rate = primary endpoint in clinical trials—natural history data = trial design)

**Imaging**:

- Chest CT reports (emphysema severity, location [upper lobe = AATD classic])
- Liver ultrasound/MRI (fibrosis staging—liver outcomes underresearched, Foundation fills gap)
- **Why valuable**: Imaging = objective measure (correlate with symptoms, genetics, predict outcomes)

**Lab Results**:

- AAT level (mg/dL—track over time, augmentation therapy target trough levels)
- Liver function tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin—monitor liver disease progression)
- **Why valuable**: Biomarkers = early disease detection (ALT rising before cirrhosis symptoms—intervene earlier)

**Healthcare Utilization**:

- Hospitalizations (# per year, reasons—exacerbations, liver complications, disease burden)
- ER visits (frequency—quality of life, healthcare costs)
- Augmentation therapy adherence (% of doses received—non-adherence = confounder in effectiveness studies)

**Why valuable**: Real-world data (clinical trials = controlled, real world = messy—Foundation captures both, completes picture)

---

### Tier 3: Advanced Data (Research Super-Participants, Subset)

**Biospecimens** (Physical Samples):

- Blood (DNA, RNA, plasma, serum—stored in biobank, researchers request)
- Sputum (respiratory cells, bacteria—lung microbiome studies, infection research)
- Liver biopsy tissue (if patient has biopsy for clinical care—leftover tissue donated, not extra biopsy just for research)
- **Why valuable**: Enable omics research (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics—next-gen science requires physical samples)

**Wearable Data** (Continuous Monitoring):

- FitBit, Apple Watch (steps, heart rate, sleep—activity level, patient-reported vs. objective)
- Pulse oximetry (O2 saturation—track oxygen use, desaturation during exertion, sleep apnea)
- **Why valuable**: Objective measures (patients forget exacerbations, wearables don't—capture true disease burden)

**Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs)**:

- Quality of life (SF-36, SGRQ—validated surveys, quarterly)
- Symptom diaries (dyspnea, fatigue, exacerbations—daily app, track patterns)
- Mental health (PHQ-9 depression screen, GAD-7 anxiety—AATD impacts mental health, underaddressed)
- **Why valuable**: Patient perspective (FEV1 may be stable, but patient feels worse—PROs capture what matters to patients)

**Social Determinants**:

- Employment status (working, disabled, retired—disease impact on livelihood)
- Insurance type (private, Medicare, Medicaid, uninsured—access disparities)
- Income bracket (optional—sensitive but important, socioeconomic factors affect outcomes)
- **Why valuable**: Health equity research (do low-income patients have worse outcomes? why?—identify intervention opportunities)

---

### Tier 4: Long-Term Outcomes (Follow-Up Data, Years-Decades)

**Disease Progression**:

- FEV1 decline rate (mL/year—varies widely, 30-80 mL/year in AATD, Foundation tracks individual trajectories)
- Exacerbation frequency (# per year—increasing exacerbations = worsening disease, hospitalization risk)
- Oxygen initiation (date started O2—milestone in disease, quality of life impact)

**Major Events**:

- Lung transplant (date, center, outcomes—survival, rejection, Foundation tracks AATD transplant outcomes)
- Liver transplant (same—AATD major transplant indication, especially pediatric)
- Death (date, cause—ultimate outcome, Foundation mortality registry informs prognosis)

**Why valuable**: Longitudinal data (10-20 year follow-up = rare, precious—researchers can't wait 20 years for new trial, Foundation's data already collected)

---

## Privacy & Security Framework

### HIPAA Compliance & Beyond

**Foundation's Commitment**: Exceed HIPAA requirements (not just legal compliance—ethical obligation, patient trust essential)

**Key Principles**:

1. **Voluntary participation** (patients opt in—never required, can withdraw anytime, no penalty)
2. **Informed consent** (patients understand what data collected, how used, risks/benefits—transparent)
3. **De-identification** (remove 18 HIPAA identifiers—name, address, phone, email, dates [except year], medical record numbers, photos [unless consented])
4. **Secure storage** (encrypted databases, access controls, audit logs—track every data access, who, when, why)
5. **Limited access** (researchers request specific datasets—approve case-by-case, not open access to all data)

---

### De-Identification Process

**Step 1: Remove Direct Identifiers**

- Name → Patient ID (P000001, P000002—unique identifier, not linked to name in researcher-accessible database)
- Address → State or 3-digit ZIP (preserve geographic data for research, not exact location)
- Phone, email → Removed (Foundation keeps separately for patient contact—researchers never see)
- Dates → Year only (birthdate → year of birth, diagnosis date → year of diagnosis, treatment start → year started)

**Step 2: Generalize Quasi-Identifiers**

- Age → Age range (38 → 35-40—if exact age + rare disease + small town, re-identification possible)
- Rare diagnoses → Categorized (patient has panniculitis + Pi\*null mutation [rare combo] → category "rare variant + skin manifestation," less specific)

**Step 3: Expert Determination**

- Privacy officer reviews (statistician calculates re-identification risk—"This dataset has <0.01% re-identification risk, acceptable")
- If risk too high → further de-identification (e.g., combine age ranges, suppress rare genotypes)

**Result**: Data useful for research, but "anonymous" per HIPAA Safe Harbor or Expert Determination (gold standard)

---

### Re-Identification Safeguards

**Attacks to Prevent**:

1. **Direct matching** (researcher has patient's name, tries to find in dataset—prevented by removing names, random IDs)
2. **Cross-database linking** (researcher combines Foundation data + public data [voter records, etc.]—links based on ZIP + age + sex—prevented by generalizing quasi-identifiers)
3. **Insider threats** (Foundation employee steals data—prevented by access controls, audit logs, encryption)

**Technical Safeguards**:

- **Encryption at rest** (data on servers encrypted—AES-256, if laptop stolen, data useless without key)
- **Encryption in transit** (data moving over internet encrypted—HTTPS, VPN, prevent eavesdropping)
- **Role-based access** (researchers access only approved datasets—can't browse full database, query limits)
- **Audit logs** (every data access logged—who viewed Patient P000042 data? when? what fields?—detect/deter misuse)
- **Two-factor authentication** (researcher login = password + phone code—prevent unauthorized access)

**Organizational Safeguards**:

- **Data Use Agreements** (researchers sign contract—"I won't try to re-identify patients, I won't share data with others, I'll delete data when done")
- **IRB oversight** (researchers submit protocol to Institutional Review Board—third-party review, ensure ethical research)
- **Foundation Scientific Advisory Board reviews** (every data request—"Is this scientifically sound? Ethical? Worth privacy risk?"—approve/deny)

---

## Informed Consent Process

### What Patients Consent To (Clear, Understandable Language)

**Consent Form Key Elements** (12-page document, 8th-grade reading level):

**Section 1: Purpose** (Why we're doing this)

- "The Mark Egly Foundation is building a research database to help scientists understand Alpha-1 and develop better treatments. Your data will be used for research studies approved by our Scientific Advisory Board."

**Section 2: What We'll Collect** (Be specific)

- "We'll collect your medical records, test results, genetic information, and ask you to complete surveys. You can choose how much data to share—basic, detailed, or everything including biospecimens."

**Section 3: How We'll Use Your Data** (Transparency)

- "Researchers will use your data to study disease progression, test effectiveness, genetic risk factors, and design clinical trials. Your data may be used in multiple studies over many years."

**Section 4: Privacy Protections** (Address fears)

- "We'll remove your name and other identifying information. Data will be stored in secure, encrypted databases. Only approved researchers will access data, and they'll sign agreements not to try to identify you."

**Section 5: Risks** (Honest)

- "Risk of re-identification: Very low but not zero. Someone with enough information might figure out data is yours. We take steps to prevent this, but no system is perfect."
- "Emotional risk: Seeing your data may be upsetting (e.g., decline in lung function). You can choose not to view your own data."
- "Incidental findings: If we discover something unexpected (e.g., gene for Alzheimer's), we'll discuss with you whether you want to know."

**Section 6: Benefits** (Realistic)

- "You may not benefit directly, but your data will help future AATD patients. You'll get free access to your data and can learn from research findings."

**Section 7: Voluntary & Withdrawal** (Emphasize choice)

- "Participation is completely voluntary. You can withdraw anytime by emailing registry@markeglyfoundation.org. We'll stop collecting new data, but data already shared with researchers may be used (can't un-share, but no new sharing)."

**Section 8: Questions & Contact** (Accessible)

- "Questions? Contact Privacy Officer: privacy@markeglyfoundation.org, (XXX) XXX-XXXX. Independent ethics review: [IRB contact info]."

### Tiered Consent (Patients Choose Level)

**Level 1: Basic Consent** (Most participants)

- ✅ Share de-identified medical records, test results (FEV1, AAT level, imaging reports)
- ✅ Complete annual survey (health update, medications, hospitalizations)
- ❌ No biospecimens (no blood draws, sputum)
- ❌ No genetic data sharing beyond SERPINA1 genotype (whole genome stays private)
- **Burden**: Low (annual survey 15 minutes, no clinic visits)

**Level 2: Enhanced Consent** (Engaged participants)

- ✅ Everything in Level 1
- ✅ Share whole genome data (if available—23andMe, clinical sequencing)
- ✅ Quarterly surveys (PROs, symptom diaries—more granular data)
- ✅ Wearable data (FitBit, Apple Watch—if patient uses)
- ❌ No biospecimens (still no blood draws)
- **Burden**: Moderate (quarterly surveys 30 minutes, link wearables—1 hour setup)

**Level 3: Research Partner Consent** (Super-participants, ~10-20% of registry)

- ✅ Everything in Level 1 + 2
- ✅ Donate biospecimens (one-time blood draw 30 mL, optional sputum, tissue if biopsy done clinically)
- ✅ Participate in ancillary studies (researcher contacts—"We're studying lung microbiome, would you provide sputum sample?")
- ✅ Re-contact for clinical trials (if eligible—Foundation asks "Would you like to hear about gene therapy trial?")
- **Burden**: High (clinic visit for blood draw, additional surveys/studies—10-20 hours/year, committed participants)

**Why Tiered?**

- Inclusivity (low-burden option—more patients participate, larger registry)
- Depth (high-burden option—rich data for advanced research, subset willing to do more)
- Respect autonomy (patients choose level—empower, not coerce)

---

## Data Collection Methods

### Method 1: Patient Portal (Foundation Website)

**Patient Dashboard** (MarkEglyFoundation.org/MyData—login with email/password):

**Features**:

- **Enroll** (consent form online—DocuSign, eSign, HIPAA-compliant, timestamp)
- **Upload records** (PDF of medical records, lab results—drag/drop, Foundation staff extract data manually or OCR)
- **Complete surveys** (quarterly health update—15 questions, 10 minutes, web-based)
- **View your data** (optional—patients see their own de-identified data, graphs [FEV1 over time], compare to registry average [anonymized])
- **Manage consent** (change level, withdraw, update contact info—patient control)

**Advantages**: Convenient (home, anytime), patient-driven (Foundation doesn't need to chase), scalable (1,000 or 10,000 patients, same portal)

**Challenges**: Tech literacy (older patients struggle—Foundation offers phone support, paper forms if needed), Data quality (patient-entered = errors—Foundation validates, follows up on anomalies)

---

### Method 2: EHR Integration (Automated Data Pull)

**Partnership with Health Systems**:

- Foundation partners with Cleveland Clinic, National Jewish, UF, MUSC (Centers of Excellence—many AATD patients)
- Hospitals grant Foundation data access (via FHIR API—Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, modern EHR standard)
- Automated nightly pulls (Foundation queries EHR—"Send updated FEV1, labs, meds for Patient P000042," data flows automatically)

**Advantages**: Complete data (no patient burden—data collected during clinical care, not extra), Real-time (new FEV1 test done today—in registry tomorrow), Accurate (no manual entry errors—direct from hospital system)

**Challenges**: Privacy complexity (hospitals cautious—HIPAA, legal agreements slow [6-12 months negotiation]), Technical hurdles (EHR integration expensive—$50K-$100K per hospital, requires IT resources), Limited to partnered hospitals (patients at non-partner hospitals must self-report)

**Foundation Priority**: Start manual (patient portal Year 1-2), add EHR integration Year 3+ (as Foundation budget, IT capacity grows)

---

### Method 3: Biospecimen Collection (Research Partner Participants)

**Blood Draw Options**:

- **Option A: At clinic visit** (patient sees pulmonologist—Foundation arranges blood draw same day, no extra trip)
- **Option B: Mobile phlebotomy** (Foundation contracts Examine.com, Quest Patient Service Center—phlebotomist comes to patient's home)
- **Option C: Mail-in kit** (patient orders kit—includes lancet [finger prick], blood spot card, mail back—dried blood spots stable at room temp, genomic DNA extractable)

**Storage**:

- Biobank (Cleveland Clinic, Mayo, or commercial [RUCDR Infinite Biologics]—Foundation ships samples, stored -80°C freezer)
- Aliquots (1 sample → 10 tubes—researchers request 1 tube, 9 remain for future, maximize utility)
- Chain of custody (tracked—every sample labeled Patient ID + Collection Date + Aliquot #, barcode scanned at every step)

**Research Access**:

- Researcher submits request ("I need 100 Pi\*ZZ plasma samples for proteomic study")
- Scientific Advisory Board approves
- Biobank ships samples (dry ice, overnight—maintain cold chain, preserve integrity)
- Researcher returns unused aliquots (if applicable—not consumed in assay)

**Cost**: $100-$200/patient (collection, processing, storage—Foundation funds, patient free)

---

## Research Access Governance

### Who Can Access Data?

**Eligible Researchers**:

- ✅ Academic scientists (universities, medical centers—PI with track record, IRB approval)
- ✅ Biotech/pharma (if partnering with Foundation—e.g., Beam Therapeutics gene therapy research, Foundation co-owns results)
- ✅ Government researchers (NIH, FDA—public interest, non-commercial)
- ❌ Commercial entities alone (no pharma accessing data without Foundation partnership—avoid exploitation, patients didn't consent to corporate profit without benefit)

---

### Data Request Process (Step-by-Step)

**Step 1: Application** (Online form):

- Researcher submits proposal (2-3 pages—research question, methods, variables needed, timeline, publication plan)
- CV/biosketch (demonstrate expertise—published in field, qualified to do proposed work)
- IRB approval (if study involves human subjects—local IRB reviewed, approved, protects patients)

**Step 2: Scientific Review** (Foundation's Scientific Advisory Board):

- Monthly meeting (SAB reviews all applications—scientific rigor, feasibility, importance)
- Scoring (1-5 scale—5 = excellent, must fund, 1 = poor, reject)
- Decision (approve, request revisions, reject—feedback provided, encourage resubmission if close)

**Step 3: Data Use Agreement** (Legal Contract):

- Researcher signs (agree to Foundation's terms—no re-identification attempts, no data sharing without permission, cite Foundation in publications, return unused biospecimens)
- Institution signs (university cosigns—institutional responsibility, liability)
- Foundation signs (all parties bound—enforceable)

**Step 4: Data Access** (Secure Transfer):

- Foundation prepares dataset (de-identified, specific variables requested—not full database, minimal necessary)
- Transfer via secure portal (encrypted upload—researcher downloads, or mailed hard drive [encrypted])
- Access for defined period (1-2 years—enough to complete study, then data deleted [unless renewal granted])

**Step 5: Publication Review** (Not Censorship, Factual Accuracy):

- Researcher submits manuscript draft (Foundation reviews—ensure data interpreted correctly, Foundation acknowledged, no re-identification risk in publication)
- Foundation suggests edits (if errors, misinterpretations—no veto over negative findings, just factual accuracy)
- Researcher submits to journal (Foundation citation—"Data provided by Mark Egly Foundation AATD Registry")

**Step 6: Data Return/Destruction** (End of Project):

- Researcher deletes data (certifies deletion—email confirmation, legally binding)
- Unused biospecimens returned (if applicable—ship back to biobank, can't keep)
- Final report to Foundation (summary—what was learned, publications resulting, impact)

---

### Publication Policy

**Foundation Requirements**:

- ✅ **Acknowledge Foundation** (in manuscript—"Supported by Mark Egly Foundation registry" or "Data from Mark Egly Foundation," proper credit)
- ✅ **Cite registry** (if registry has publication describing it—cite that paper, helps Foundation's academic credibility)
- ✅ **Share preprints** (send Foundation draft before journal submission—review for accuracy, not approval, transparency)
- ❌ **No publication veto** (Foundation can't block publication because results unfavorable—academic freedom, credibility essential)

**Co-Authorship**:

- Foundation staff co-author if substantial contribution (designed study, analyzed data, wrote manuscript—earned authorship)
- Not automatic (researcher used data ≠ Foundation co-author—avoid gift authorship, dilutes meaning)

---

## Patient Incentives

### Why Patients Participate (Intrinsic + Extrinsic Motivation)

**Intrinsic** (Most Powerful):

- ✅ **Altruism** ("Help future patients—cure for my kids, grandkids")
- ✅ **Sense of purpose** ("AATD took so much from me, donating data gives back")
- ✅ **Community** ("I'm part of something bigger—10,000 patients united")

**Extrinsic** (Helpful, Not Sufficient Alone):

- ✅ **Access to own data** (see your FEV1 trends, compare to others—self-knowledge valuable)
- ✅ **Research results** (Foundation emails summaries—"Your data helped discover genetic modifier," recognition)
- ✅ **Tax deduction** (genetic data = property, donating = charitable contribution?—see Tax Deduction Strategy doc, experimental but possible)
- ✅ **Clinical trial priority** (registry participants learn about trials first—early access to experimental treatments)
- ✅ **Free genetic testing upgrade** (registry participants get whole genome sequencing—$1,000 value, Foundation-funded, research + personal benefit)

---

### Tax Deduction for Data Donation (Innovative Incentive)

**Legal Theory**:

- Genetic data = intellectual property (similar to art, manuscript—tangible property, market value)
- Donating IP to charity = charitable deduction (IRS allows deduction for donated property—fair market value)
- Value = cost to generate + research utility (whole genome sequencing costs $1,000, has research value—appraisal $1,000-$5,000?)

**Implementation**:

- Foundation works with tax attorneys (2-3 years to get IRS ruling—Private Letter Ruling, or test in court)
- If approved—patients donate data, receive Form 8283 (noncash charitable contribution—report on taxes, deduct $1K-$5K)
- **Incentive**: 1,000 patients donate data + deduct $3,000 average (save $750 taxes if 25% tax bracket—worth it for patients, Foundation gets data, win-win)

**Risk**: IRS may challenge (novel approach—precedent unclear, Foundation needs legal budget $100K-$200K to defend if challenged)

**See Full Analysis**: Tax Deduction Strategy for DNA Donation document (next in master plan)

---

## Technical Infrastructure

### Database Architecture

**Data Warehouse** (Centralized, Structured):

- **Platform**: REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture—gold standard for clinical research databases, HIPAA-compliant, used by thousands of universities)
- **Alternative**: Custom build on AWS/Azure (more flexible, expensive—$500K+ development, Foundation uses REDCap Year 1-5, consider custom Year 5+ if needs outgrow)

**Data Model** (Relational Database):

- **Tables**:
  - `Patients` (Patient_ID, Year_Of_Birth, Sex, State, Genotype—one row per patient)
  - `Lung_Function` (Patient_ID, Test_Date_Year, FEV1, FVC, DLCO—multiple rows per patient, longitudinal)
  - `Medications` (Patient_ID, Start_Year, Drug_Name, Dose, Frequency)
  - `Surveys` (Patient_ID, Survey_Date, Question_1, Question_2, …—PROs)
  - `Biospecimens` (Patient_ID, Collection_Date, Sample_Type, Biobank_ID, Location)
- **Relationships**: Patient_ID links tables (join queries—"Show me all FEV1 tests for Patient P000042")

**Data Dictionary** (Define Every Variable):

- FEV1 definition (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second, measured in liters, pulmonary function test, indicates lung obstruction)
- Units (L, mL, % predicted—standardize, no mixing units)
- Valid range (FEV1 = 0.5 to 6.0 L in adults—values outside = data errors, flag for review)
- Missing data codes (999 = unknown, 888 = not applicable, 777 = refused to answer—distinguish types of missingness)

---

### Security Infrastructure

**Network Security**:

- **Firewall** (block unauthorized access—only specific IPs can access database, e.g., Foundation office, approved researchers' institutions)
- **VPN** (Foundation staff access remotely—encrypted tunnel, no open internet access)
- **Intrusion detection** (monitor for attacks—log all login attempts, flag suspicious [100 failed logins in 1 minute = attack])

**Database Security**:

- **Encryption at rest** (data on hard drives encrypted—AES-256, if server stolen, data unreadable without key)
- **Encryption in transit** (data moving between servers, users encrypted—HTTPS, TLS, prevent eavesdropping)
- **Role-based access control** (users assigned roles—"Registry Coordinator" can add patients, "Researcher" can query de-identified data, "Admin" can access identifiers, least privilege principle)
- **Audit logs** (every action logged—who accessed what data when, tamper-proof log, detect breaches)

**Backup & Disaster Recovery**:

- **Daily backups** (automated—3am daily, full database backup)
- **Off-site storage** (backups sent to AWS S3 Glacier—geographically separate, if office burns down, data safe)
- **Test restores** (annually—ensure backups work, many organizations don't test, discover corrupt backups too late)

---

### Cost

**Year 1 Setup**: $100K-$150K

- REDCap license: $5K-$10K/year (Vanderbilt University—hosted, supported)
- Database design: $30K (consultant—design schema, data dictionary, forms, 3 months work)
- Security audit: $20K (third-party—penetration test, HIPAA compliance review, certification)
- Legal review: $20K (privacy attorney—review consent forms, DUAs, policies)
- Biobank setup: $30K (negotiate with Cleveland Clinic Biobank—freezer space, sample tracking system, 1 year)

**Ongoing**: $50K-$80K/year

- REDCap hosting: $10K/year
- Cloud storage: $5K/year (AWS—database backups, de-identified datasets for researchers)
- Staff: $50K-$60K/year (0.5 FTE Database Manager—answer researcher questions, prepare datasets, maintain system)
- Biobank storage: $10K-$20K/year (per-sample fees—$20-$50/sample/year, 500 samples = $10K-$25K)

---

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

### IRB Oversight

**Foundation's IRB** (Institutional Review Board):

- External IRB (Foundation contracts with commercial IRB [WCG IRB, Advarra]—independent ethics review, avoid conflict of interest)
- Annual review (IRB reviews registry—consent process, data security, any adverse events [breaches, patient complaints], approve continuation)
- Modifications (if Foundation changes consent form, adds new data type—IRB must approve before implementing)

**Cost**: $15K-$25K/year (IRB fees—initial review $5K, annual renewal $3K, modifications $2K each, worth it for ethical oversight, legal protection)

---

### GINA Protections (Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act)

**What GINA Covers**:

- ✅ **Health insurance** (insurers can't deny coverage, raise premiums based on genetic data—GINA 2008 federal law)
- ✅ **Employment** (employers can't refuse to hire, fire, discriminate based on genetics)

**What GINA Doesn't Cover**:

- ❌ **Life insurance** (companies can request genetic testing, deny coverage based on results—legal)
- ❌ **Disability insurance** (same—can discriminate based on genetics)
- ❌ **Long-term care insurance** (same)

**Foundation's Disclosure**:

- Consent form explains GINA (patients know protections—and gaps)
- Recommend caution ("If considering life insurance, purchase before genetic testing or data donation—once in database, technically accessible to life insurers via court order [rare but possible]")

---

### International Considerations (GDPR if Expanding)

**If Foundation Expands to Europe** (Year 5+):

- **GDPR compliance** (General Data Protection Regulation—EU privacy law, stricter than HIPAA)
- **Key differences**:
  - Right to erasure (patients can demand data deleted—Foundation must comply, harder if data already shared with researchers)
  - Data minimization (collect only necessary data—can't hoard "just in case")
  - DPO required (Data Protection Officer—Foundation must hire if processing EU data)
- **Cost**: $50K-$100K additional (legal, technical changes to comply—worth it if reaching 50K European AATD patients)

---

## Implementation Roadmap

### Year 1: Foundation & Pilot (500 Participants)

**Q1-Q2: Infrastructure Setup**

- Contract with REDCap (Vanderbilt—host database)
- Design database (data dictionary, forms—Registry Coordinator + consultant)
- Develop consent forms (attorney review—plain language, IRB approval)
- IRB submission (external IRB—initial review, 4-6 weeks approval)

**Q3: Pilot Launch**

- Recruit 50 pilot participants (Foundation support groups—"We're launching registry, will you join?," feedback)
- Test enrollment process (find bugs—consent confusing? portal crashes?—fix before full launch)
- Collect first data (annual surveys, medical records upload—validate data quality)

**Q4: Full Launch**

- Recruit broadly (website, social media, events—"Join registry, help research")
- Goal: 500 participants by end Year 1 (5% of diagnosed US patients—strong start)
- First researcher data request (by Q4—Foundation processes, tests data release workflow)

**Cost Year 1**: $200K (setup $150K + ongoing $50K half-year)

### Year 2: Growth & Engagement (1,500 Total Participants)

**Goals**:

- Add 1,000 participants (double Year 1—momentum building, word-of-mouth)
- Launch biobank (pilot—50 participants donate blood, test logistics)
- First research publication (Foundation-led paper—"The Mark Egly Foundation AATD Registry: Design, Methods, Baseline Characteristics," describe registry, recruit researchers)

**Enhancements**:

- Mobile app (iOS/Android—patients complete surveys on phone, more convenient, better compliance)
- Data dashboard (patients view own data—FEV1 graphs, anonymized comparisons, engagement)

**Cost Year 2**: $150K (growth + enhancements)

---

### Year 3: Scale & Partnerships (3,000 Total Participants)

**Goals**:

- Add 1,500 participants (continued growth—30% of diagnosed patients enrolled, major milestone)
- EHR integration pilot (Cleveland Clinic—automated data pull, test before broader rollout)
- 10 researcher projects (Foundation data used in 10 studies—demonstrate utility, publications)

**Partnerships**:

- Partner with 23andMe (23andMe identifies AATD patients—invites to join Foundation registry, 1,000+ additional participants)
- Partner with pharma (Grifols, CSL—patients on augmentation invited to join registry, industry collaboration)

**Cost Year 3**: $200K (EHR integration $100K, operations $100K)

---

### Year 4-5: Maturity (5,000 Total Participants, Research Acceleration)

**Goals**:

- Add 1,000 participants/year (steady state—new diagnoses, ongoing recruitment)
- 50 research projects (Foundation data = go-to resource for AATD researchers worldwide)
- International expansion (pilot—100 European patients, test GDPR compliance)

**Impact**:

- Natural history publication (10-year FEV1 decline in 3,000 Pi\*ZZ patients—definitive study, cited in every future AATD trial)
- Gene therapy trial (Foundation registry = recruitment platform—AGTC trial enrolls 100 patients in 6 months [instead of 3 years], accelerates approval)

**Cost Year 4-5**: $250K/year (mature operations, larger scale)

---

### Year 10 Vision: World's Largest AATD Database

**10,000 Participants** (10% of all US AATD patients, 50% of diagnosed):

- 20 years longitudinal data (patients enrolled Year 1 still participating Year 10—track entire disease course)
- 100+ publications (Foundation-supported research transforms AATD science)
- 2,000 biospecimens (biobank enables omics research—proteomics, metabolomics, next-gen discoveries)

**Foundation = Scientific Hub**:

- Every AATD clinical trial recruits from registry (gene therapy, new drugs, diagnostics—all use Foundation)
- FDA cites Foundation data (regulatory decisions—drug approvals, label changes, registry = real-world evidence gold standard)
- Patients worldwide benefit (US registry informs European, Asian care—Foundation's data = global public good)
